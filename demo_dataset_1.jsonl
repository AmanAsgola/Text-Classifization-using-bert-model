I deeply feel the responsibility which goes with your nomination for President of [GPE] at [TIME] of our nation's history. That I have not sought this responsibility, all of you know. I told the people of my [GPE], [DATE], that it was my intention to devote my full term as governor exclusively to their service. You have decided other-wise. In accordance with the principles of our republican form of government you have laid upon me the highest duty to which an [NORP] can be called. No one has a right to refuse such a call. With the help of God, I will try to be worthy of the trust. I accept the nomination. I am happy and proud to be associated with my good friend from [GPE], [PERSON]. For [DATE], [PERSON] has gone from state to state telling the people of the issues, of the great need for better government, for the sound principles of government, and the leader-ship which will come to it with a [NORP] victory [DATE]. Never before have I seen such good sportsmenship as that displayed by [PERSON] here [TIME] and I am proud to be associated with him. I come to this great task a free man. I have made no pledges, promises or commitments, expressed or implied, to any man or woman. I shall make none, except to the [NORP] people. These pledges I do make: To men and women of [ORG] everywhere I pledge my utmost efforts in [DATE]. In return, I ask for your support. Without it, I cannot discharge the heavy obligation you lay upon me. To [NORP] of every party I pledge that on [DATE] our government will again have a cabinet of the ablest men and women to be found in [GPE]. The members of that [ORG] will expect and will receive full delegation of the powers of their office. They will be capable of administering those powers. They will each be experienced in the task to be done and young enough to do it. This election will bring an end to [CARDINAL]-man government in [GPE]. To [NORP] of every party I pledge a campaign dedicated to [CARDINAL] and above all others-that this nation under God may continue in [DATE] a free nation of free men. At this moment on battlegrounds around the world [NORP] are dying for the freedom of our country. Their comrades are pressing on in the face of hardship and suffering. They are pressing on for total victory and for the liberties of all of us. Everything we say or do [DATE] and in the future must be devoted to the single purpose of that victory. Then, when victory is won, we must devote ourselves with equal unity of purpose to re-winning at home the freedom they have won at such desperate cost abroad. To our allies let us send from this convention [CARDINAL] message from our hearts: The [NORP] people are united with you to the limit of our resources and manpower, devoted to the single task of victory and the establishment of a firm and lasting peace. To every member of the axis powers, let us send this message from this Convention: By this political campaign, which you are unable to understand, our will to victory will be strengthened, and with [DATE] you further delay surrender the consequences to you will be more severe. That we shall win this war none of us and few of our enemies can now have any doubt. But how we win this war is of major importance for [DATE] ahead. We won the last war but it did not stay won. This time we must also win the purposes for which we are fighting. [GPE] must never again nourish the delusion that she could have won. We must carry to [GPE] a defeat so crushing and complete that every last man among them knows that he has been beaten. We must not merely defeat the armies and the navies of our enemies. We must defeat, once and for all, their will to make war. In their hearts as well as with their lips, let them be taught to say: Never again. The military conduct of the war is outside this campaign. It is and must remain completely out of politics. General [PERSON] and Admiral [PERSON] are doing a superb job. Thank God for both of them. Let me make it crystal clear that a change of administration [DATE] cannot and will not involve any change in the military conduct of the war. If there is not now any civilian interference with the military and naval commands, a change in administration will not alter this status. If there is civilian interference, the new administration will put a stop to it forthwith. But the war is being fought on the home front as well as abroad, while all of us are deeply proud of the military conduct of the war, can we honestly say that the home front could not bear improvement? The present administration in [GPE] has been in office for [DATE]. [DATE], it is at war with [ORG], and at war with itself. Squabbles between [ORG] members, feuds between rival bureaucrats and bitterness between the President and his own party members, in and out of [ORG], have become the order of [DATE]. In the vital matters of taxation, price control, rationing, labor relations, manpower, we have become familiar with the spectacle of wrangling, bungling and confusion. Does anyone suggest that the present national administration is giving either efficient or competent government? We have not heard that claim made, even by its most fanatical supporters. No, all they tell us is that in [DATE] it did some good things. That we freely grant. But now it has grown old in office. It has become tired and quarrelsome. It seems that the great men who founded this nation really did know what they were talking about when they said that [CARDINAL] terms were too many. When we have won the war, we shall still have to win the peace. We are agreed, all of us, that [GPE] will participate with other sovereign nations in a cooperative effort to prevent future wars. Let us face up boldly to the magnitude of that task. We shall not make secure the peace of the world by mere words. We cannot do it simply by drawing up a fine-sounding treaty. It can not be the work of any [CARDINAL] man or of a little group of rulers who meet together in private conferences. The structure of peace must be built. It must be the work of many men. We must have as our representatives in this task the ablest men and women [GPE] can pro-duce, and the structure they join in building must rest upon the solid rock of a united [NORP] public opinion. I am not one of those who despair of achieving that end. I am utterly confident we can do it. For [DATE], we have had men in [GPE] who were notoriously weak in certain branches of arithmetic but they specialized in division. They have been playing up minor differences of opinion among our people until the people of other countries might have thought that [GPE] was cleft in [CARDINAL]. But all the while there was a larger, growing area of agreement. Recently the overwhelming majesty of that broad area of agreement has become obvious. [ORG] can take pride in helping to define it and broaden it. There are only a few, a very few, who really believe that [GPE] should try to remain aloof from the world. There are only a relatively few who believe it would be practical for [GPE] or her allies to renounce all sovereignty and join a Super-state. I certainly would not deny these [CARDINAL] extremes the right to their opinions; but I stand firmly with the overwhelming majority of my fellow citizens in that great wide area of agreement. That agreement was clearly expressed by the Republican Mackinac Declaration and was adopted in the foreign policy plank of this Convention. No organization for peace will last if it is slipped through by stealth or trickery or the momentary hypnotism of high-sounding phrases. We shall have to work and pray and be patient and make sacrifices to achieve a really lasting peace. That is not too much to ask in the name of those who have died for the future of our country. This is no task for men who specialize in dividing our people. It is no task to be entrusted to stubborn men, grown old and tired and quarrelsome in office. We learned that in [DATE]. The building of the peace is more than a matter of international co-operation. God has endowed [GPE] with such blessings as to fit her for a great role in the world. We can only play that role if we are strong and healthy and vigorous as nature has equipped us to be. It would be a tragedy if after this war [NORP] returned from our armed forces and failed to find the freedom and opportunity for which they fought. This must be a land where every man and woman has a fair chance to work and get ahead. Never again must free [NORP] face the spectre of long-continued, mass unemployment. We [NORP] are agreed that full employment shall be a first objective of national policy. And by full employment I mean a real chance for every man and woman to earn a decent living. What hope does the present administration offer here? In [DATE], [DATE] before this country entered the war, there were still [CARDINAL] unemployed. After [DATE] of unequalled power and unparalleled spending, [ORG] had failed utterly to solve that problem. It never solved that problem. It was left to be solved by war. Do we have to have a war to get jobs? What are we now offered? Only the dreary prospect of a continued war economy after the war, with interference piled on interference and petty tyrannies rivaling the very regimentation against which we are now at war. The present administration has never solved this fundamental problem of jobs and opportunity. It can never solve this problem. It has never even understood what makes a job. It has never been for full production. It has lived in chattering fear of abundance. It has specialized in curtailment and restriction. It has been consistently hostile to and abusive of [NORP] business and [NORP] industry, although it is in business and industry that most of us make our living. In all the record of [DATE] is there anything that suggests the present administration can bring about high-level employment after this war? Is there any reason to believe that those who have so signally failed in the past can succeed in the future? The problem of jobs will not be easily solved; but it will never be solved at all unless we get a new, progressive administration in [GPE]-and that means a [NORP] administration. For [DATE] [GPE] was the hope of the world. Here on this great broad continent we had brought into being something for which men had longed throughout all history. Here, all men were held to be free and equal. Here, government derived its just powers from the consent of the governed. Here men believed passionately in freedom, independence-the God-given right of the individual to be his own master. Yet, with all of this freedom-I insist-because of this freedom-ours was a land of plenty. In a fashion unequalled anywhere else in the world, [GPE] grew and strengthened; our standard of living became the envy of the world. In all lands, men and women looked toward [GPE] as the pattern of what they, themselves, desired. And because we were what we were, good will flowed toward us from all corners of the earth. An [NORP] was welcomed everywhere and looked upon with admiration and regard. At times, we had our troubles; made our share of mistakes; but we faltered only to go forward with renewed vigor. It remained for [DATE], under the present national administration, for continuing unemployment to be accepted with resignation as the inevitable condition of a nation past its prime. It is [ORG] which tells us that [GPE] has lost its capacity to grow. We shall never build a better world by listening to those counsels of defeat. Is [GPE] old and worn out as the New Dealers tell us? Look to the beaches of [GPE] for the answer. Look to the reaches of the wide Pacific-to the corners of the world where [NORP] men are fighting. Look to the marvels of production in the war plants in our own cities and towns. I say to you: our country is just fighting its way through to new horizons. The future of [GPE] has no limit. True, we now pass through dark and troubled times, scarcely a home escapes the touch of dread anxiety and grief; yet in [TIME] the [NORP] spirit rises, faith returns-faith in our God, faith in our fellowman, faith in the land our fathers died to win, faith in the future, limitless and bright, of this, our country. In the name of that faith we shall carry our cause in [DATE] to the [NORP] people.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscoeurdaleneidaho", "text": "Your excellency, my fellow citizens, it is with the greatest pleasure that I find myself facing an audience in this great [GPE]. I echo the wish of the governor that it might be our privilege to stay a long time in [GPE] and know something more than her fame, know her people, come in contact with her industries, and see the things that we have all so long read about and admired from a distance; but, unfortunately, it is necessary for us to go back to [GPE] as soon as we can, though it was a great pleasure to escape from [GPE]. [GPE] is a very interesting place, but it is a very lonely place. The people of [GPE] do not live there, and in order to know what the people of [GPE] are thinking about and talking about it is necessary to come and find out for yourself. That really is my errand. I have taken pains since I was a boy so to saturate myself in the traditions of [GPE] that I generally feel a good deal of confidence that the impulses which I find in myself are [NORP] impulses; but no matter how thoroughly [NORP] a man may be, he needs constantly to renew his touch with all parts of [GPE] and to be sure that his mind is guided, if he be in public station, by the thoughts and purposes of his fellow countrymen. It was, therefore, with the most earnest desire to get in touch with you and the rest of my fellow countrymen that I undertook this trip, for, my fellow countrymen, we are facing a decision now in which we can not afford to make a mistake. We must not let ourselves be deceived as to the gravity of that decision or as to the implications of that decision. It will mean a great deal now, but it will mean infinitely more in the future. [GPE] has to do at this moment nothing less than prove to the world whether she has meant what she said in the past. I must confess that I have been amazed that there are some men in responsible positions who are opposed to the ratification of the treaty of peace altogether. It is natural that so great a document, full of so many particular provisions, should draw criticism upon itself for this, that, or the other provision. It is natural that a world settlement, for it is nothing less, should give occasion for a great many differences of opinion with regard to particular settlements of it, but I must admit that it amazes me that there should be any who should propose that the arrangement be rejected altogether, because, my fellow citizens, this is the issue: We went into this Great War from which we have just issued with certain assurances given ourselves and given the world, and these assurances can not be fulfilled unless this treaty is adopted. We told the world and we assured ourselves that we went into this war in order to see to it that the kind of purpose represented by [GPE] in this war should never be permitted to be accomplished by [GPE] or anybody else. Do not let your thoughts dwell too constantly upon [GPE]. [GPE] attempted this outrageous thing, but [GPE] was not the only country that had ever entertained the purpose of subjecting the peoples of the world to its will, and when we went into this war we said that we sent our soldiers across the seas not because we thought this was an [NORP] fight in particular, but because we knew that the purpose of [GPE] was against liberty, and that where anybody was fighting liberty it was our duty to go into the contest. We set this Nation up with the profession that we wanted to set an example of liberty not only, but to lead the world in the paths of liberty and justice and of right; and at last, after long reflection, after long hesitation, after trying to persuade ourselves that this was a [NORP] war and nothing more, we suddenly looked our own consciences in the face and said, This is not merely a [NORP] war. This is a war which imperils the very principles for which this Government was set up, and it is our duty to lend all the force that we have, whether of men or of resources, to the resistance of these designs. And it was [GPE] never let anybody forget this it was [GPE] that saved the world, and those who propose the rejection of the treaty propose that, after having redeemed the world, we should desert the world. It would be nothing less. The settlements of this treaty can not be maintained without the concerted action of all the great Governments of the world. I asked you just now not to think exclusively about [GPE], but turn your thoughts back to what it was that [GPE] proposed. [GPE] did direct her first force against [GPE] and against [GPE], but you know that it was not her purpose to remain in [GPE], though it was part of her purpose to remain in [GPE]. She was using her arms against these people so that they could not prevent what she intended elsewhere, and what she intended elsewhere was to make an open line of dominion between her and the Far East. The formula that she adopted was [GPE] to [GPE], the North Sea to [GPE] to crush not only little [GPE], whom she first started to crush, but all the [NORP] States, get [GPE] in her grasp, take all the [NORP] and [NORP] lands beyond, penetrate the wealthy realms of [GPE], open the gates of [GPE], and, by dominating the central trade routes of the world, dominate the world itself. That was her plan; and what does the treaty of peace do? For I want you to remember, my fellow countrymen, that this treaty is not going to stand by itself. The treaty with [GPE] has now been signed; it will presently be sent over, and I shall lay that before [ORG]. It will be laid down along exactly the same lines as the treaty with [GPE]; and the lines of the treaty with [GPE] suggest this, that we are setting up the very [GPE] which [GPE] and [GPE] intended to dominate as independent, self-governing units. We are giving them what they never could have got with their own strength, what they could have got only by the united strength of the armies of the world. But we have not made them strong by making them independent. We have given them what I have called their land titles. We have said, These lands that others have tried to dominate and exploit for their own uses belong to you, and we assign them to you in fee simple. They never did belong to anybody else. They were loot. It was brigandage to take them. We give them to you in fee simple. But what is the use of setting up the titles if we do not guarantee them? And that guaranty is the only guaranty against the repetition of the war we have gone through just so soon as the [NORP] nation, [CARDINAL], 000 strong, can again recover its strength and its spirit, for east of [GPE] lies the fertile field of intrigue and power. At this moment the only people who are dealing with the [NORP] government in [GPE] are the [NORP]. They are fraternizing with the few who exercise control in that distracted country. They are making all their plans that the financing of [GPE] and the commerce of [GPE] and the development of [GPE] shall be as soon as possible in the hands of [NORP]; and just so soon as she can swing that great power, that is also her road to the East and to the domination of the world. If you do not guarantee the titles that you are getting up in these treaties, you leave the whole ground fallow in which again to sow the dragon's teeth with the harvest of armed men. That, my fellow citizens, is what article 10, that you hear so much talked about in the covenant of the league of nations, does. It guarantees the land titles of the world; and if you do not guarantee the land titles of the world, there can not be the ordered society in which men can live. Off here in this beloved continent, with its great free stretches and its great free people, we have not realized the cloud of dread and terror under which the people of Europe have lived. I have heard men over there say, It is intolerable. We would rather die now than live [DATE] under the cloud that has hung over us ever since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, because we have known that this force was gathering, we have known what the purpose was ultimately to be, we have known that blood and terror lay ahead of us, and we can not and will not live under that cloud any more. [GPE], my fellow citizens, is necessary to the peace of the world. [GPE] is absolutely necessary to the peace of the world. [GPE] realizes that; and I want to tell you now and here I wish I could proclaim it in tones so loud that they would reach the world [GPE] wants us to stay out of this treaty. Not under any deception. Not under the deception that we will turn in sympathy toward her. Not under the. delusion that we would seek in any direct or conscious way to serve [GPE], but with the knowledge that the guaranties will not be sufficient without [GPE], and that, inasmuch as [GPE] is out of the arrangement, it will be very useful to [GPE] to have [GPE] out of the arrangement. [GPE] knows that if [GPE] is out of the arrangement [GPE] will lose the confidence and cooperation of all the other nations in the world, and, fearing [GPE]'s strength, she wants to see [GPE] alienated from the peoples from whom she has been alienated. It is a perfectly reasonable program. She wants to see [GPE] isolated. She is isolated. She wants to see [CARDINAL] great nation left out of this combination which she never would again dare face. Evidences are not lacking nay, evidences are abounding that the [NORP] propaganda has started up in this country coincidently with the opposition to the adoption of this treaty. I want those who have any kind of sympathy with the purposes with which we went into the war now to reflect upon this proposition: Are we going to prove the enemy of the rest of the world just when we have proved their savior? The thing is intolerable. The thing is impossible. [GPE] has never been unfaithful and she never will be unfaithful. Do not let anybody delude you, my fellow citizens, with the pose of being an [NORP]. If I am an [NORP] I want at least to be an intelligent [GPE]. If I am a true [NORP] I will study the true interests of [GPE]. If I am a true [NORP] I will have the world vision that [GPE] has always had, drawing her blood, drawing her genius, as she has drawn her people, out of all the great constructive peoples of the world. A true [NORP] conceives [GPE] in the atmosphere and whole setting of her fortune and her destiny. And [GPE] needs the confidence of the rest of the world just as much as other nations do. [GPE] needs the cooperation of the rest of the world to release her resources, to make her markets, above all things else to link together the spirits of men who mean to redeem the race from the wrongs that it has suffered. This western country is par excellence the country of progressivism. I am not now using it with a big P. It does not make any difference whether you belong to [ORG] or not; you belong to the progressive thought, and I hope every intelligent man belongs to the progressive thought. It is the only thought that the world is going to tolerate. If you believe in progress, if you believe in progressive reform, if you believe in making the lot of men better, if you believe in purifying politics and enlarging the purposes of public policy, then you have got to have a world in which that will be possible; and if [GPE] does not enter with all her soul into this new world arrangement, progressives might as well go out of business, because there is going to be universal disorder, as there is now universal unrest. Do not mistake the signs of the times, my fellow countrymen, and do not think that [GPE] is immune. The poison that has spread all through that pitiful nation of [GPE] is spreading all through Europe. There is not a statesman in Europe who does not dread the infection of it, and just so certainly as those people are disconcerted, thrown back upon their own resources, disheartened, rendered cynical by the withdrawal of the only people in the world they trust, just so certainly there will be universal upsetting of order in Europe. And if the order of Europe is upset, do you think [GPE] is going to be quiet? Have you not been reading in the papers of the intolerable thing that has just happened in [GPE]? When the police of a great city walk out and leave that city to be looted they have committed an intolerable crime against civilization; and if that spirit is going to prevail, where are your programs? How can you carry a program out when every man is taking what he can get? How can you carry a program out when there is no authority upon which to base it? How can you carry a program out when every man is looking out for his own selfish interests and refuses to be bound by any law that regards the interests of the others? There will be no reform in this world for a generation if the conditions of the world are not now brought to settled order, and they can not be brought to settled order without the cooperation of [GPE]. I am not speaking with conjecture, my fellow citizens. I would be ashamed of myself if upon a theme so great as this I should seek to mislead you by overstatement of any kind. I know what I am talking about. I have spent [DATE] amidst those disturbed peoples on the other side of the water, and I can tell you, now and here, that the only people they depend upon to bring the world to settled conditions are the people of [GPE]. A chill will go to their heart, a discouragement will come down upon them, a cynicism will take possession of them, which will make progress impossible, if we do not take part not only, but do not take part with all our might and with all our genius. Everybody who loves justice and who hopes for programs of reform must support the unqualified adoption of this treaty. I send this challenge out to the conscience of every man in [GPE], that if he knows anything of the conditions of the world, if he knows anything of the present state of society throughout the world and really loves justice and purposes just reform, he must support the treaty with [GPE]. I do not want to say that and have it proved by tragedy, for if this treaty should be refused, if it should be impaired, then amidst the tragedy of the things that would follow every man would be converted to the opinion that I am now uttering, but I do not want to see that sort of conversion. I do not want to see an era of blood and of chaos to convert men to the only practical methods of justice. My fellow citizens, there are a great many things needing to be reformed in [GPE]. We are not exempt from those very subtle influences which lead to all sorts of incidental injustice. We ourselves are in danger at this present moment of minorities trying to control our affairs, and whenever a minority tries to control the affairs of the country it is fighting against the interest of the country just as much as if it were trying to upset the Government. If you think that you can afford to live in a chaotic world, then speak words of encouragement to the men who are opposing this treaty, but if you want to have your own fortunes held steady, realize that the fortunes of the world must be held steady; that if you want to keep your own boys at home after this terrible experience, you will see that boys elsewhere are kept at home. Because [GPE] is not going to refuse, when the other catastrophe comes, again to attempt to save the world, and, having given this proof once, I pray God that we may not be given occasion to prove it again! We went into this war promising every loving heart in this country who had parted with a beloved youngster that we were going to fight a war which would make that sacrifice unnecessary again, and we must redeem that promise or be of all men the most unfaithful. If I did not go on this errand through [GPE], if I did not do everything that was within my power that is honorable to get this treaty adopted, and adopted without qualification, I never could look another mother in the face upon whose cheeks there were the tears of sorrowful memory with regard to the boy buried across the sea. The moral compulsion laid upon [GPE] now is a compelling compulsion, and can not be escaped. My fellow countrymen, because it is a moral issue, because it is an issue in which is mixed up every sort of interest in [GPE], I am not in the least uneasy about the result. If you put it on the lowest levels, you can not trade with a world disordered, and if you do not trade you draw your own industries within a narrower and narrower limit. This great State, with its untold natural resources, with its great undeveloped resources, will have to stand for a long generation stagnant because there are no distant markets calling for these things. All [GPE] will have to wait a long, anxious generation through to see the normal courses of her life restored. So, if I were putting it upon the lowest conceivable basis of the amount of money we could make, I would say, We have got to assist in the restoration of order and the maintenance of order throughout the world by the maintenance of the morale of the world. You will say, How? By arms? That, I suspect, is what most of the opponents of the league of nations, at any rate, try to lead you to believe, that this is a league of arms. Why, my fellow citizens, it is a league to bring about the thing that [GPE] has been advocating ever since I was born. It is a league to bring it about that there shall not be war, but that there shall be substituted for it arbitration and the calm settlement of discussion. That is the heart of the league. The heart of the league is this: Every member of the league, and that will mean every fighting nation in the world except [GPE], agrees that it will never go to war without first having done [CARDINAL] or the other of [CARDINAL] things either having submitted the matter in dispute to arbitration, in which case it agrees absolutely to abide by the result, or having submitted it to consideration by [ORG], in which case it promises to lay all the documents, all the facts, in its possession before the council and to give the council [DATE] in which to consider the matter, and, if it does not like the opinion of the council at [DATE], still to wait [DATE] more before it resorts to arms. That is what [GPE] has been striving for. That is what [ORG] directed me to bring about. Perhaps you do not know where; it was in an unexpected place, in the naval appropriations bill. [ORG], authorizing a great building program of ships and the expenditure of vast sums of money to make our [ORG] one of the strongest in the world, paused a moment and declared in the midst of the appropriation bill that it was the policy of [GPE] to bring about disarmament and that for that purpose it was the policy of [GPE] to cooperate in the creation of a great international tribunal to which should be submitted questions of international difference and controversy, and it directed the [speaker] of [GPE], not later than the close of this war, to call together an international conference for that purpose. It even went so far as to make an appropriation to pay the expenses for the conduct of such a conference in the city of [GPE]. And that is a continuing provision of the naval appropriations bill. When I came back with this covenant of the league of nations, I had fulfilled the mandate of the [ORG] of [GPE]; and now they do not like it. There is [CARDINAL] conceivable reason for not liking it, my fellow citizens, and to me as an [NORP] it is not a conceivable reason; that is that we should wish to do some nation some great wrong. If there is any nation in the world that can afford to submit its purposes to discussion, it is [ORG]. If I belonged to some other nations, there are some things that I know that I would not like to see submitted to the discussion of mankind, but I do not know anything in the present purposes of [GPE] that I would not be perfectly willing to lay upon any table of counsel in the world. In carrying out the mandate of the [ORG], I was serving the age-long purpose of this great people, which purpose centers in justice and in peace. You will say, Well, why not go in with reservations? I wonder if you know what that means. If [ORG] passes a resolution of ratification and says that it ratifies on condition that so and so is understood, that will have to be resubmitted to every signatory of the treaty; and what gravels me is that it will have to be submitted to [ORG] at [GPE]. That goes against my digestion. We can not honorably put anything in that treaty, which [GPE] has signed and ratified, with [GPE]'s consent; whereas it is perfectly feasible, my fellow countrymen, if we put interpretations upon that treaty which its language clearly warrants, to notify the other Governments of the world that we do understand the treaty in that sense. It is perfectly feasible to do that, and perfectly honorable to do that, because, mark you, nothing can be done under this treaty through the instrumentality of the council of the league of nations except by a unanimous vote. The vote of [GPE] will always be necessary, and it is perfectly legitimate for [GPE] to notify the other Governments beforehand that its vote in the council of the league of nations will be based upon such and such an understanding of the provisions of the treaty. The treaty is not susceptible of misunderstanding. I do not object to painting the rose or refining fine gold; there is not any phrase in the covenant of the league of nations that can legitimately be said to be of doubtful meaning, but if the [ORG] of [GPE] wants to state the meaning over again in other words and say to the other nations of the world, We understand the treaty to mean what it says, I think that is a work of supererogation, but I do not see any moral objection to it. But anything that qualifies the treaty, anything that is a condition to our ratification of it, must be submitted to all the others, and we must go over this process again; this process which took [DATE] of intensive labor, which took [DATE] of very difficult adjustment and arrangement, which quieted jealousies, which allayed suspicions, which set aside controversies, which brought about the most extraordinary union of minds that, was ever brought about in so miscellaneous an assembly, divided by so many interests. All that must be gone over again, and in the meantime the world must wait and its unrest grow deeper, and all the pulses of life go slower, waiting to see what is going to happen, all because [GPE] asks the other governments of the world to accept what they have already accepted in different language. That is all that it amounts to; I means, all that the reasonable reservations amount to. Some of them amount to staying out altogether, some of them amount to a radical change of the spirit of the instrument, but I am speaking now of those which some men of high conscience and of high public purpose are seriously pressing in order that there may be no misunderstanding. You can avoid a misunderstanding without changing the document. You can avoid a misunderstanding without qualifying the terms of the document, because, as I have said and shall say again and again, [GPE] is at liberty as one of the voting members of the partnership to state how she understands the articles of copartnership. I beg that these things may sink in your thoughts, my fellow countrymen, because we are at a turning point in the fortunes of the world. Out upon these quiet hills and in these great valleys it is difficult sometimes for me to remember the turmoil of the world in which I have been mixing on the other side of the sea; it is difficult for me to remember the surging passions which moved upon the face of the other continents of the world; it is difficult for me to remember the infinite suffering that happened even in this beloved country; it is difficult for me to remember the delegations from weak peoples that came to me in [GPE], figuratively speaking, with outstretched hands, pleading that [GPE] should lead the way out of the darkness into the light; it is difficult out here in this great peace for anybody, even, I dare say, for these fine fellows in khaki who were over there and saw something of it, to remember the whole strain and terror of the thing, but we must remember it, my fellow citizens, and we must see to it that that strain and terror never come upon the world again. It is with this solemn thought, that we are at a turning point in the destinies of mankind and that [GPE] is the makeweight of mankind, that I, with perfect confidence, leave this great question to your unbiased judgment.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0", "text": "The gathering and publication of news has a deeper significance than is sometimes realized. No large enterprise can exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it performs some great service, not for itself, but for others; or, failing therein, it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist. This is the case with [ORG]. It is one of the eyes of mankind which never slumbers. Without ceasing, it assembles [DATE] the events of each part of the world, and transmits them to every other part. The fundamental reason for this lies in the fact that it is felt to be of vital importance to each man, and each community, to know what other men and other communities are doing. The news is printed and read, not for the mere purpose of entertainment, amusement and recreation, but almost entirely for the practical purpose of information, in order that by means of accurate knowledge of what others are doing a course may be laid out of accurate and successful action. Faith in the [NORP] people means a faith in their ability to form sound judgments, when once the facts have been presented to them clearly and without prejudice. It is this educational work, national in its scope, that [ORG] performs, and upon its integrity and fairness depends in large measure the course of public opinion in [GPE]. This work is done without any tinge of personal or political opinion. A very practical need exists, and it is met by a very practical service. It is individual in its nature. It is a personal service for each one of us, making its appeal entirely to the intelligence of the individual and recognizing fully the [NORP] ideal of intellectual independence. This conception is not exactly at variance with, but certainly supplementary to, the long cherished [NORP] ideal of the independence of the individual and the independence of the nation. Granted that the largest possible independence is a desirable goal, the consideration at once arises as to how such independence can best be secured. The work of [ORG], both necessary and logical, indicates that the true method would appear to lie in recognizing the broad principle of our individual and national dependence, calculating the requirements which flow from that condition, and governing ourselves accordingly. Complete independence means complete coordination and cooperation. From this principle arises the oft-repeated law of service-we can help ourselves only as we help others. A knowledge and an understanding of others become absolutely necessary, in order to make our ideals practical. [CARDINAL] of the preeminent requirements of our country at the present time is to reestablish and emphasize in the public mind this law of service. The danger to [GPE] is not in the direction of the failure to maintain its economic position, but in the direction of the failure to maintain its ideals. The principle of service is not to be confounded with a weak and impractical sentimentalism. It does not mean that either the individual or the nation is to assume the burdens which ought to be borne by others. It is warranted in considering self to the extent of recognizing that it is justifiable to accumulate and hold the resources which must necessarily be used to serve ourselves, our own household, and our own nation. But it does not stop there. It recognizes also the necessity of serving others, and when the need arises for meeting a moral requirement, of making individual and national sacrifices sufficient to maintain the cause of righteousness. Some of the recent developments in [GPE] have revealed the dangers to which I refer in a very dramatic way. Beginning [DATE] our country entered a period when conditions were altogether artificial and abnormal, culminating in the strained and lurid events of our participation in the war. The old standards of action were either suspended or entirely cast aside. Altogether too many of those in a position to do so began to take advantage of the necessities of the situation for their own profit. Finally nearly all of those in responsible positions throughout the entire civilized world had but [CARDINAL] main object in view, which was the winning of the war. They began to make almost every consideration and motive subsidiary to that great effort. Totally inconceivable amounts of money were raised and expended with a lavishness which [DATE] would have been believed impossible, and which now seems like some wild nightmare. Notwithstanding the great wave of patriotic fervor which swept over the land; notwithstanding the tremendous sacrifices which the people in every walk of life made, and stood ready to make; almost unconsciously these conditions developed, which I mention not for any purpose now to criticize, where the least scrupulous became the greatest gainers and a considerable part of our population was thrown into a morbid financial state of mind, which even the best intentioned did not wholly escape. The desire for profits and more profits kept on increasing, and the quest for easy money became well-nigh universal. All of this meant an attempt to appropriate the belongings of others without rendering a corresponding service. This condition began to subside [DATE], but it left along its course a trail of vicious and criminal selfishness which in diminishing degree has ever since been attempting to gratify an appetite grown all the sharper through indulgence, and a general credulity to rumors of large sums of money demanded and paid on account of every conceivable motive and action. From all of this sordidness the affairs of government, of course, suffered. In some of it a few public officers were guilty participants. But the wonder is not that this was so much or so many, rather that it has been so little and so few. The encouraging thing at present is the evidence of a well-nigh complete return to normal methods of action, and a sane public opinion. The gravity of guilt of this kind is fully realized and publicly reprehended. There is an exceedingly healthy disposition to uproot it altogether, and administer punishment wherever competent evidence of guilt can be produced. That I am doing and propose to continue. Another phase of lingering extravagance, from which the country has not yet fully recovered, is revealed by a consideration of the bills which are pending before the [ORG], calling for an expenditure of public money. Exceedingly great efforts have been put forth to reduce the cost of government. [CARDINAL] of public employees have been released, and every department has been thoroughly deflated and placed under most competent financial supervision. The country as a whole is demanding with great vigor every possible relief from the burden of every unnecessary public expenditure. Yet notwithstanding this, minority groups of one kind or another, and organizations, sometimes almost nation-wide in their ramifications, are making the most determined assaults upon the public treasury. I am advised by the Director of [ORG] that careful computation discloses that there are bills pending that are seriously pressed for passage, not including the bonus, which would increase the expenditures of [ORG] for [DATE] by [MONEY]. This would mean that outside of [ORG], which is practically self-sustaining, the present rate of expenditure would be more than doubled. Each one of these items taken by itself is not large, and its supporters argue that certainly the Government can afford to make this small additional payment. But taken in the aggregate they make the stupendous sum I have mentioned, and their assumption by the Government would mean nothing less than financial disaster to the nation. The law of service must be applied to this situation. Our country is very rich, but were its possessions increased many-fold, it would not be warranted in paying out money except for value received. Value received on the part of the Government is estimated by a general consideration of all the attending conditions. At present our country does not need a greater outlay of expense, but a greater application of constructive economy. The same state of mind is revealed again in the determined resistance which is made to the adoption of a sound method of taxation. The main argument of the opposition can all be reduced to the supposition that the general public can be relieved of taxation and a greater proportion of taxes laid oil the rich. I shall not examine the soundness of this proposal, the economic injury which it would inflict, or its impossibility as a working principle. I mention it as another example of an attempt to minister to a supposed desire to evade the law of service. It seems as though the public is assumed to desire to have the advantages of a government without paying its part of the cost of maintaining it. Besides being convinced that such a result is utterly impossible of accomplishment, I am even more firmly of the belief that it misrepresents the general attitude of the public mind. Moreover, the success of the Government does riot lie in wringing all the revenue it can from the people, but in making their burden as light and fairly distributed as possible, consistent with the proper maintenance of the necessary public functions. The Government itself, in order to be successful, and all of those connected with it, must put all of their energy upon what they can do for the people, not upon what they can get out of them. These are some of the reasons which reveal to us why, in our domestic affairs, we must be possessed of accurate information of the doings and needs of others, in order that we may best serve ourselves by serving them through appropriate action. We are all a part of one common country. To be in a healthy and successful condition economically, means a free interplay of competition in service, based upon that mutual faith in each other which we term public confidence. Notwithstanding the disturbing character of recent revelations, notwithstanding the enormous pressure for the passage of legislation which would greatly increase the cost of maintaining [ORG], notwithstanding the failure of a majority of the [ORG] up to the present time accurately to comprehend and expeditiously to minister to the need of taxation reform, I believe that the requirements of economy and reduced taxes will be met in a way not inconsistent with the great resources of our country. While I have thought it desirable to point out dangerous tendencies, I know that with few exceptions the management of our Government has been and is in honest and competent hands, that its finances are sound and well managed, and that the business interests of the nation, including the owners, managers and employees, are representative of honorable and patriotic motives, and that the present economic condition warrants a continuation of confidence and prosperity. Fundamentally, [GPE] is sound. It has both the power and disposition to maintain itself in a healthy economic and moral condition. But it can not do this by turning all its thoughts in on itself, or by making its material prosperity its supreme choice. Selfishness is only another name for suicide. A nation that is morally dead will soon be financially dead. The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If [GPE] wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals. When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is one ideal of national existence to which [GPE] has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by [CARDINAL] government and [CARDINAL] people about other governments and other peoples. There is likewise involved the same law of service. If our country is to stand for anything in the world, if it is to represent any forward movement in human progress, these achievements will be measured in no small degree by what it is able to do for others. Up to [DATE], [GPE] gave almost its entire attention to self-development. In that it achieved an unequaled success. The service which it rendered to others was to a considerable degree one of example. It revealed the ability of the people to take charge of their own affairs. It demonstrated the soundness and strength of self-government under free institutions, while affording a refuge for the oppressed of other lands. The great influence which the mere existence of [NORP] institutions exercised upon the rest of the world would be difficult to overestimate. At the end of a long period of steady accomplishments of this nature came the war with [GPE], which left our country a world power with world responsibilities. It is not too much to say that in meeting and bringing to a successful conclusion that conflict our country performed a world service. This was followed by a period of most remarkable industrial development. There were great consolidations of properties, enormous investments of capital, and a stupendous increase of production, all accompanied by a growth of population reaching many [CARDINAL]. This was our condition at the outbreak of the World War. For a long time we sought to avoid this conflict, on the assumption that it did not concern us. On that subject we were lacking in accurate information. We found, at last, that while it was also the grave concern of others, it did concern us intimately and perilously. We took our part in the war at length, in the defense of free institutions. We believe, while acknowledging that we were [CARDINAL] of the contributing elements, that our participation was a decisive factor. The result was a demonstration of the strength of self-governing peoples, and a victory for free institutions. Our action at this time was distinctly a world service. [GPE] made its sacrifice for what it believed was the cause of righteousness. The sacrifices made on these occasions, which resulted in a benefit to others, resulted likewise in a benefit to ourselves. Even the evil effects which always arise from war and its aftermath have only tempered, not obliterated, these results. A flow of material resources set in toward our country, which is still going on. The general standards of living were raised. In the resulting plenty many of the did hardships of existence were removed. Our country came into a position where it had a greatly increased opportunity for world leadership. In moral power it took a higher rank. There can be little doubt that our presence at the treaty table softened the terms and diminished the exactions of the victorious nations, where joint covenants of defensive alliance were in part substituted for the usual territorial transfers. Our country refused to adhere to the covenant of [ORG] with a decisive rejection which I regard as final. Following this came a continuing effort to collect reparations, which the economic chaos of [GPE] after a time caused to be suspended. This resulted in the [NORP] seizure of the [GPE], with [NORP] conferences, plans and discussions for renewing payment of reparations under some settled method of permanent adjustment. Although indirectly interested by reason of our commerce, and more especially because of the debts due to us, in having a [NORP] settlement, our Government felt that the fundamental questions involved in all these discussions were the direct political concern of Europe. Our policy relative to the debts due to us from [NORP] countries was well known, and we refused to submit them to these discussions. This never meant that [GPE] was not willing to lend its assistance to the solution of the [NORP] problem in any way that did not involve us in their purely political controversies, whenever opportunity presented a plan that promised to be just and effective. But we realized that all effort was useless until all parties came to a state of mind where they saw the need to make concessions and accept friendly counsel. In [DATE] our Secretary of [ORG], Mr. [PERSON], set out the [NORP] proposal in an address which he delivered at [GPE]. That proposal has now become historic. He recognized that settlement of the reparations question was probably impossible if approached after the method of a political problem. It was not so much a question to be dealt with by public officers or diplomatic agencies, which must necessarily reflect to a very marked degree the political state of mind of the various countries, but was represented as me which could be solved by the application of pure business talent and experienced private enterprise. , To such an effort of business men, unhampered by every unnecessary political consideration, Mr. [PERSON] expressed the belief that competent [NORP] citizens in private life would be ready to lend their assistance. This position was consistently maintained. Its correctness was finally demonstrated when Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] were invited by [ORG] for that purpose, and consented to serve. The finding of the experts, which is known as [ORG], has recently been made and published. It shows a great deal of research and investigation, and a broad comprehension of the requirements of the situation. It has been favorably received by [ORG]. It is gratifying to understand that the [NORP] are looking upon it with full sympathy, and [GPE] has expressed a willingness to cooperate in the execution of the plan. There appears to be every reason to hope that the report offers a basis for a practical solution of the reparations problem. I trust that it may commend itself to all the [NORP] Governments interested as a method by which, through mutual concessions, they can arrive at a stable adjustment of the intricate and vexatious problem of reparations, and that such an outcome will provide for the restoration of [GPE] and the largest possible payments to the other countries. If this result is secured, the credit which will be due to the Secretary of [ORG], Mr. [PERSON], to [[PERSON] for adopting it and supporting it, and to the [CARDINAL] [NORP] and their assistants, by whose wisdom and discretion it was formulated and rendered so acceptable, will be sufficient to warrant the lasting approbation of [CARDINAL] continents. A situation at once both intricate and difficult has been met in a most masterful way. Our countrymen are justified in looking at the result with great pride. Nothing of more importance to Europe has occurred since the Armistice. Part of the plan contemplates that a considerable loan should at once be made to [GPE] for immediate pressing needs, including the financing of a bank. I trust that private [NORP] capital will be willing to participate in advancing this loan. Sound business reasons exist why we should participate in the financing of works of peace in Europe, though we have repeatedly asserted that we were not in favor of advancing funds for any military purpose. It would benefit our trade and commerce, and we especially hope that it will provide a larger market for our agricultural production. It is notorious that foreign gold has been flowing into our country in great abundance. It is altogether probable that some of it can be used more to our financial advantage in Europe than it can be in [GPE]. Besides this, there is the humanitarian requirement, which carries such a strong appeal, and the knowledge that out of our abundance it is our duty to help where help will be used for meeting just requirements and the promotion of a peaceful purpose. We have determined to maintain, and can maintain, our own political independence, but our economic independence will be strengthened and increased when the economic stability of Europe is restored. We hope further that such a condition will be the beginning of a secure and enduring peace. Certainly it would remove many of the present sources of disagreement and misunderstanding among the [NORP] nations. When this adjustment is finally made, and has had sufficient time of operation to become a settled [NORP] policy, it would lay the foundation for a further effort at disarmament in accordance with the theory of [ORG]. Although that gathering was able to limit capital battleships, it had to leave the question of submarines, air craft, and land forces unsolved. The main reason for this was the unsettled and almost threatening condition that still existed in Europe. A final adjustment for the liquidation of reparations ought to be the beginning of a new era of peace and good will. In the event that such a condition develops, it becomes pertinent to examine what can be done by our own country, in cooperation with others, further to rid ourselves and the rest of the world of the menace and burden of competitive armaments and more effectively insure the settlement of differences between nations, not by a recourse to arms, but by a recourse to reason; not by action leading to war, but by action leading to justice. Our past experience should warn us not to be overconfident in the face of so many failures, but it also justifies the hope that something may be done where already there has been some success, and at least we can demonstrate that we have done all that we can. As a result of [NORP] initiative there is already in existence [ORG] which is equipped to function wherever arbitration seems desirable, and based in part on that, and in part on the [ORG], there is [ORG], which is already functioning. A proposal was sent to the last [ORG] by [PERSON] for our adherence to the covenant establishing this court, which I submitted to the favorable consideration of the present [ORG] in my [DATE] message. Other plans for [ORG] have been broached, but up to the present time this has seemed to me the most practical one. But these proposals for arbitration and courts are not put forward by those who are well informed with the idea that they could be relied upon as an adequate means for entirely preventing war. They are rather a method of securing adjustment of claims and differences, and for the enforcement of treaties, when the usual channels of diplomatic negotiation fail to resolve the difficulty. Proposals have also been made for the codification of international law. Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction, although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals. [CARDINAL] of the difficulties to be encountered would be the necessity of securing the consent of all the nations, but no doubt the agreement of the major [ORG] would go very far in producing that result. I do not claim to be able to announce any formula that will guarantee the peace of the world. There are certain definite things, however, that I believe can be done, which certainly ought to be tried, that might relieve the people of the earth of much of the burden of military armaments and diminish the probability of military operations. I believe that among these are frequent international conferences suited to particular needs. [ORG] did a great deal to restore harmony and good will among the nations. Another purpose of a conference is the further limitation of competitive armaments. Much remains to be accomplished in that direction. It would appear to be impractical to attempt action under present conditions, but with a certain and definite settlement of [NORP] reparations firmly established, I should favor the calling of a similar conference to achieve such limitations of armaments and initiate plans for a codification of international law, should preliminary inquiries disclose that such a proposal would meet with a sympathetic response. But the main hope of success lies in first securing a composed state of the public mind in Europe. It is my firm belief that [GPE] is in a position to take the lead in this direction. It is undoubtedly too much to suppose that we hold very much of the affectionate regard of other nations. At the same time we do hold their respect. Our position is such that we are trusted and our business institutions and [ORG] considered to be worthy of confidence. If there is disappointment in some directions that we do not enter alliances with them, it is more than overbalanced by the knowledge that there is no danger that we shall enter alliances against them. It must be known to every people that we are seeking no acquisition of territory, and maintaining no military establishment with unfriendly and hostile intent. Like our political institutions, all of this is a powerful example throughout the world. Very many of the nations have been the recipients of our favor, and have had the advantage of our help in some time of extremity. We have no traditional enemies. We have come to a position of great power and great responsibility. Our first duty is to ourselves. [NORP] standards must be maintained, [NORP] institutions must be preserved. The freedom of the people politically, economically, intellectually, morally and spiritually, must continue to be advanced. This is not a matter of [DATE] or [DATE]. It may be of generations, it may be of an era. It is for us here and now to keep in the right direction, to remain constant to the right ideals. We need a faith that is broad enough to let the people make their own mistakes. Let them come unto knowledge and understanding by their own experience. Little progress can be made by merely attempting to repress what is evil, our great hope lies in developing what is good. [CARDINAL] newspaper is .better than many criminal laws. [CARDINAL] schoolmaster is better than a legion of bailiffs. [CARDINAL] clergyman is better than an army with banners. These are our guarantees of internal peace and progress. On what nations are at home depends what they will be abroad. If the spirit of freedom rules in their domestic affairs, it will rule in their foreign affairs. The world knows that we do not seek to rule by force of arms, our strength is in our moral power. We increase the desire for peace everywhere by being peaceful. We maintain a military force for our defense, but our offensive lies in the justice of our cause. We are against war because it is destructive. We are for peace because it is constructive. We seek concord with all nations through mutual understanding. We believe in treaties and covenants and international law as a permanent record for a reliable determination of action. All these are evidences of a right intention. But something more than these is required to maintain the peace of the world. In its final determination it must come from the heart of the people. Unless it abide there, we can not build for it any artificial lodging place. If the will of the world be evil, there is no artifice by which we can protect the nations from evil results. Governments can do much for the betterment of the world. They are the instruments through which humanity acts in international relations. Because they can not do everything, they must not neglect to do what they can. But the final establishment of peace, the complete maintenance of good will toward men, will be found only in the righteousness of the people of the earth. Wars will cease when they will that they shall cease. Peace will reign when they will that it shall reign.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebanquettenderedhimtheunionleagueclubsanfranciscocalifornia", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], and You, My Fellow-Members of [ORG]: [Cheers and applause] Let me say in all sincerity, Mr. [PERSON], that you have expressed far better than I could express what I hold to be essential in [NORP] citizenship. It was a privilege, sir, to be greeted by you as you have greeted me [TIME]. No one can too strongly insist upon the elementary fact that you cannot build the superstructure of public virtue save on private virtue. The sum of the parts is the whole, and if we wish to make that whole, the [ORG], decent, the representative and exponent and symbol of decency, it must be so made through the decency, public and private, of the average citizen. Mr. [PERSON] was quite safe in saying he hoped I had enjoyed my stay in [GPE]. I should indeed be ungrateful, unappreciative, if I were not deeply touched and moved by the way in which the people of [GPE] have received me; and I have enjoyed to the full [DATE] I have spent here. I have enjoyed it all and I have enjoyed no part more, General [PERSON], than my ride down the line, reviewing the troops with you. [NORP] are good [NORP], and therefore it is not necessary to appeal to them on behalf of the army and the navy. I shall not detain you long [TIME]. I am promised by Colonel [PERSON] the chance, after my speech, of meeting and shaking hands with each of you, in the rooms of the [ORG]. I have just got [CARDINAL] thoughts, not connected together, to which I want to give utterance [TIME]; one suggested by something that Mr. [PERSON] said. It is absolutely essential, if we are to have the proper standard of public life, that promise shall be square with performance. A lie is no more to be excused in politics than out of politics. A promise is as binding on the stump as off the stump, and there are [CARDINAL] facets to that crystal. In the first place, the man who makes a promise which he does not intend to keep and does not try to keep should rightly be adjudged to have forfeited in some degree what should be every man's most precious possession-his honor. On the other hand, the public that exacts a promise which ought not to be kept, or which cannot be kept, is by just so much forfeiting its right to self-government. There is no surer way of destroying the capacity for self-government in a people than to accustom that people to demanding the impossible or the improper from its public men. No man fit to be a public man will promise either the impossible or the improper; and if the demand is made that he shall do so it means putting a premium upon the unfit in public life. There is the same sound reason for distrusting the man who promises too much in public that there is for distrusting the man who promises too much in private business. If you meet a doctor who asserts that he as a specific remedy that will cure all the ills to which human flesh is heir, distrust him, He hasn?t got it. If you meet the business man who vociferates that he is always selling everything to you at a loss, and you continue to deal with him I am glad if you suffer for it. Any man who promises as a result of legislation or administration [DATE] is making a promise which he will find difficulty in keeping. Any man who asserts that by any law it will be possible, out of hand, to make all humanity good and wise, is again promising what he cannot perform. It is indispensable that we should have good laws and upright and honest and fearless administration of the laws; and we are not to be excused if we fail to hold our public men to a rigid accountability if they fail, in their turn, to see that we have proper legislation and proper administration. No public man worth his salt will be other than glad to be held accountable in that fashion. But important though the law is, though the administration of the law is, we can never escape having to face the fundamental truth that neither begins to be of the decisive importance that the average individual's character is. In the last analysis it is the man's own character which is and must ever be the determining factor in his success or failure in life , and therefore in the last analysis it is the average character of the average citizenship of a nation which will in the long run determine whether that nation is to go up or down. The [CARDINAL] indispensable thing for us to keep is a high standard of character for the average [NORP] citizen. Now for my unrelated second thought, and that is to reiterate something that I said [TIME]. I had the very great pleasure of dedicating the monument to [PERSON]'s fleet for its victory at [GPE]. We [DATE] were enjoying the aftermath of the triumph, due in part to what [PERSON] and his officers and men did on [DATE], [DATE], and in even greater part to what those men did who in [DATE] had prepared for the winning of that triumph. I have very great confidence in the capacity of our average soldier or sailor to turn out well, to do admirably when put to the supreme test. But the best man alive, if untrained, if unfitly armed, may be beaten by a poorer man who has had the training and the arms. There is nothing more foolish, nothing less dignified than to indulge in boastfulness, in self-glorification as to the capacity of our soldiers and sailors while denying them the material which we are in honor bound to give them in order that their splendid natural qualities shall be fitly supplemented. [Cheers and applause] I have seen our people send [NORP] volunteers against a [NORP] soldiery, that , [NORP] soldiery armed with the finest type of modern rifle and ours with an old black-powder weapon, which was about as effective as a medieval cross bow; and those who failed to prepare the proper weapons for our people are not to be thanked, because by making drafts of an extraordinary kind upon the other good qualities of the [NORP] soldier, we escaped disaster. And who were those who failed to prepare? It is very easy and worse than foolish, it is wicked, to hold the people who at the moment are obliged to use those weapons responsible when the real responsibility lay with the representatives of our people and our people themselves for failing to make the preparation in advance. The business of finding a scapegoat to send loose into the wilderness is neither honorable nor dignified for a self-respecting people to be engaged in. We commemorated [DATE] by a monument a great naval victory. We commemorated thereby the foresight, the prudence of the public men, of the great business men, of the shipwrights, the men who worked physically at the armor, the guns, the engines, the hulls, in getting the fleet ready; and, more than that, we commemorated the men who trained that fleet in readiness. Many an officer who was retired before the Spanish War came is entitled to his full share of the credit for what was done in that war, although he never saw it, because he had done his part in actual sea service in training the men to handle the mighty and delicate weapons of war intrusted to their care. Every public man who by his vote helped to make efficient that navy, every business man, every wage-worker, who did honest work on the ships, and every representative of the navy, officer or enlisted man, who in [DATE] before the war faithfully did his duty aboard the ships in fitting crew and ship for the test of war, is entitled to a portion of the credit of the victory in [GPE]. So it is with the army. I believe-no, I am not going to boast, and so I am going to say a little less than I think-I shall shift the form of my sentence and say that I have entire confidence in the average officer and average enlisted man in the army of [GPE] if only he is given any kind of a fair chance, but give him good weapons, and give him a chance to handle them and to handle himself so as to be prepared for war. The best man alive, if he is given no chance to practice, cannot be expected when first put to a test to show his abilities at their best. Give us a chance to handle our men in masses in time of peace. Remember that if you scatter the army in [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] all over the country, you must expect as inevitable, and as not in the least blameworthy on the part of the army, trouble, when you come to gather them together as an army and to send them into a foreign country. Give our army a chance, or even [CARDINAL] a chance, to practice in time of peace the performance of its proper function in time of war, and I can guarantee that the [NORP] people will ever in the future have the same cause that they have had in the past to be proud of the army and navy of [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthebostoncollegecentennialceremonies", "text": "Father [PERSON], [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], members of the faculty, ladies and gentlemen: It is a great pleasure to come back to a city where my accent is considered normal, and where they pronounce the words the way they are spelled ! I take especial satisfaction in [DATE]. As the recipient of an honorary degree in [DATE] from [ORG], and therefore an instant alumnus, I am particularly pleased to be with all of you on this most felicitous occasion. This university, or college, as Father [PERSON] has described, was founded in [DATE] of the Civil War, when this Nation was engaged in a climactic struggle to determine whether it would be [CARDINAL] slave and [CARDINAL] free or all free. And now, [DATE], after [DATE] perhaps in human history, we are faced with the great question of whether this world will be [CARDINAL] slave and [CARDINAL] free, or whether it will be all [CARDINAL] or the other. And on this occasion, as in [DATE], the services of [ORG] are still greatly needed. It is good also to participate in this ceremony which has honored [CARDINAL] distinguished citizens of the free world--President [PERSON], Father [PERSON], and our friend from the world of freedom, Lady [PERSON]. [ORG] is [DATE] by the life span of men, but young by that of universities. In [DATE] of observance, you have rightly celebrated the achievements of the past, and equally rightly you have turned in a series of discussions by outstanding scholars to the problems of the present and the future. Learned men have been talking here of the knowledge explosion, and in all that they have said I am sure they have implied the heavy present responsibility of institutions like this one. Yet [DATE] I want to say a word on the same theme, to impress upon you as urgently as I can the growing and insistent importance of universities in our national life. I speak of universities because that is what [ORG] has long since become. But most of what I say applies to liberal arts colleges as well. My theme is not limited to any one class of universities, public or private, religious or secular. Our national tradition of variety in higher education shows no sign of weakening, and it remains the task of each of our institutions to shape its own role among its differing sisters. In this hope I am much encouraged by a reading in [DATE] of the remarkable encyclical, Pacem in Terris. In its penetrating analysis of [DATE]'s great problems, of social welfare and human rights, of disarmament and international order and peace, that document surely shows that on the basis of [CARDINAL] great faith and its traditions there can be developed counsel on public affairs that is of value to all men and women of good will. As a [NORP] I am proud of it; and as an [NORP] I have learned from it. It only adds to the impact of this message that it closely matches notable expressions of conviction and aspiration from churchmen of other faiths, as in recent documents of [ORG], and from outstanding world citizens with no ecclesiastical standing. We are learning to talk the language of progress and peace across the barriers of sect and creed. It seems reasonable to hope that a similar process may be taking place across the quite different barriers of higher learning. From the office that I hold, in any case, there can be no doubt [DATE] of the growing meaning of universities in [GPE]. That, of course, is [CARDINAL] basic reason for the increasing urgency with which those who care most for the progress of our society are pressing for more adequate programs in higher education and in education generally. It is for this reason that I urge upon everyone here and in this country the pressing need for national attention and a national decision in the national interest upon the national question of education. In [CARDINAL] ways, the new realities of [DATE] have combined to intensify the focal role of the university in our Nation's life. First, and perhaps most obvious, the whole world has come to our doorstep and the universities must be its student. In the strange geometry of modern politics, the distant [GPE] can be as close to us as [GPE], and [GPE], itself, is worth more attention than we have sometimes given. Cultures not our own press for understanding. Crises we did not create require our participation. Accelerating change is the [CARDINAL] universal human prospect. The universities must help. Second, there is indeed an explosion of knowledge and its outward limits are not yet in sight. In some fields, progress seems very fast; in others, distressingly slow. It is no tribute to modern science to jump lightly to the conclusion that all its secrets of particle physics, of molecular life, of heredity, of outer space, are now within easy reach. The truth is more massive and less magical. It is that wherever we turn, in defense, in space, in medicine, in industry, in agriculture, and most of all in basic science, itself, the requirement is for better work, deeper understanding, higher education. And while I have framed this comment in the terms of the natural sciences, I insist, as do all those who live in this field, that at every level of learning there must be an equal concern for history, for letters and the arts, and for man as a social being in the widest meaning of [PERSON]'s phrase. This also is the work of the university. And third, as the world presses in and knowledge presses out, the role of the interpreter grows. Men can no longer know everything themselves; [DATE] has no universal man. All men [DATE] must learn to know through one another--to judge across their own ignorance--to comprehend at second hand. These arts are not easily learned. Those who would practice them must develop intensity of perception, variety of mental activity, and the habit of open concern for truth in all its forms. Where can we expect to find a training ground for this modern maturity, if not in our universities? Fourth and finally, these new requirements strengthen still further what has always been a fundamental element in the life of [NORP] colleges and universities--that they should be dedicated to the [ORG]'s service. The phrase is [PERSON], and no one has discussed its meaning better. What he said in [DATE] is more relevant [DATE] than ever before, and I close with a quotation from him. I offer it to you with renewed congratulations, and in the confident hope that as [DATE] opens, [ORG] will continue to respond--as she did in her beginnings-to the new needs of the age. It is not learning, said President [PERSON], but the spirit of service that will give a college place in the public annals of the [ORG]. It is indispensable, he said, if it is to do its right service, that the air of affairs should be admitted to all its classrooms... the air of the world's transactions, the consciousness of the solidarity of the race, the sense of the duty of man toward man the promise and the hope that shine in the face of all knowledge .... The days of glad expansion are gone, our life grows tense and difficult; our resource for the future lies in careful thought, providence, and a wise economy; and the school must be of the [ORG]. [ORG] for too [DATE] has been of the [ORG] and so it will be for [DATE]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington", "text": "y address, I wonder if you would mind if I would communicate to you an odd thought that occurred to me, as I sat here. There was brought to me in emphatic form once, by an old soldier of mine, who reminded me that you could never tell what was around the corner in the world. When I first came back from Europe [DATE], and before my friends found that it was utterly futile and useless to try to make me appear better on the TV by the use of paints and stains, they had me in a little room [TIME], and the man was working very seriously on my face in an effort to do something about it. Finally, in this very preoccupied sort of job and atmosphere that was prevailing, he suddenly began to laugh. And he said to me, General, we have got ourselves in a funny fix. He said, Here you are, an old General, trying to turn politician. And he said, I am a beautician. Do you know what I was in the war? said, No. He said, I was [CARDINAL] of your paratroopers. What made me think of that [TIME] was the fact that when I first met [PERSON], I was detailed as a young officer to coach a football team and I made him an end, and he worked pretty hard under me for [DATE] and [DATE]. [DATE], I think that all of you would like for me to speak for you in commending him as a brilliant head of a great organization which not only here but throughout our land has built up these great works in flood control, in drainage, in water conservation, and power development-an organization of which not only [ORG] but which [GPE] is proud. My friends, to join you in so important a ceremony--here in the heart of the Pacific Northwest--is indeed a privilege. I am delighted to be here with you on this historic spot. Our Nation was [DATE] when, from a point near here, [CARDINAL] [NORP] of great courage--[PERSON] and [PERSON]--pushed off and floated to the mouth of this great river. [DATE], a man named [PERSON] struggled over primitive paths in this area. [DATE]., a frontiersman named [PERSON], with his family, reached this almost virgin land to establish his home. Both of these men had famous descendants--men who have contributed much to the extraordinary growth of the Northwest. From the [PERSON] family came an able Governor and a dedicated Secretary of the [ORG]--[PERSON]. From the [PERSON] came the great [NORP] whose name forevermore will distinguish this monumental work. Senator [PERSON] believed deeply in the future of this country. He had the grit and determination to help build that future. In this endeavor he worked side by side with those men of vision of this region who, before [DATE], sought to open to navigation the upper reaches of the Columbia River. With that drive for an open river for water traffic came the natural development of hydro-electric power. [DATE], death denied Senator [PERSON] the privilege of seeing his dream come true. But the will to build this dam lived after him. And may I pause to pay my personal tribute to Mrs. [PERSON], here with us [DATE] on the platform. That the will to build this dam survived-and that [DATE] this dam is built--are due to the spirit of distinguished citizens of this region. Especially are they due to an [NORP] who carried on Senator [PERSON]'s work and for [DATE] has labored tirelessly to complete this project--my good friend, Senator [PERSON]. I am mindful as well of the sustained effort of many Congressmen from this region, including particularly Congressman [PERSON], who have worked in behalf of this and other great projects here in the Northwest. Now, this massive dam, my friends, means much more than the steel and concrete, more than the genius and the effort that went into its building. It means more than the benefits and the progress--however great--that it will bring to this fortunate region. This structure symbolizes the purpose of using, for the benefit of all our people, the tremendous natural legacy with which the Almighty so abundantly endowed our land. Wisely and providently we must use and develop these resources, so that each succeeding generation of [NORP] may share in their benefits. It is for us to see that they shall not be wasted or neglected or denied to generations yet to come. Now, among these treasures of our land is water fast becoming our most valuable, most prized, most critical resource. A blessing when properly used--it can bring devastation and ruin when left uncontrolled. It is essential that every drop of water, from the moment that it falls upon our land, be turned to the service of our people. Thus we will save our soil and make it more productive: thus we will develop power, prevent floods, improve navigation, and supply our tremendous and growing domestic and industrial needs for water. So crucial to our future has water become, that I have assigned appropriate surveys and plans concerning it to a special committee of the [ORG], and to [ORG] as well. These studies, when subjected to [NORP] action, will undoubtedly result in the comprehensive water policy that this country has needed since its very beginning. The wise control of our water resources obviously requires the most skillful and comprehensive planning. This dam, for example, is designed to operate in coordination with similar structures, upstream and down. It is part of a plan to assure the full use of the water resources of this entire river system. [FAC] is, therefore, representative of the coordination that must mark the development of all of our river systems. It is, moreover, an example of national responsibility properly assumed by [ORG]. [QUANTITY] river is another structure--the bridge at [GPE]. I am sure that you who live here are just as proud of that bridge as you are of this tremendous dam. You have every right to be. That bridge at [GPE] is an example of local responsibility properly assumed. A major difference between the [CARDINAL] undertakings is in size. All of you know that when construction was started on [FAC], no local enterprise--public or private--could have financed it, so, realizing that the dam was necessary, [ORG] gave its support. The bridge at [GPE] was a much smaller effort. Local enterprise-in this case the county government--was able to shoulder the [MONEY] loan that made that construction possible. And so, local enterprise did that job. These [CARDINAL] structures illustrate an idea we have been applying in [GPE] for [DATE]. It is not a new concept. [DATE] [PERSON] put it better than anyone else has done. He said, The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves--in their separate and individual capacities. Now, in keeping with [PERSON]'s standard, [ORG] has certain vital responsibilities in such fields relating to the control and use of water as flood control, improvement of navigation, and reclamation and development of land. When in the course of assuming these responsibilities, dams are built, then hydro-electric power is often developed, of great value to the surrounding regions and to the [ORG]. I hope that we shall soon have another example of [ORG] responsibility in the generation of power. I refer to [FAC], which-like this great [FAC]--is a project requiring the resources of [ORG]. From its location on the [NORP] border, on a tributary of this mighty Columbia River, it will powerfully aid the control of floods, and produce a new means of generating power, all the way to the sea. I have recently acted to remove obstacles to the construction of that dam. A new site has been selected. A distinguished northwesterner, Governor [PERSON] of [GPE], has been named Chairman of [ORG]. His intimate knowledge of this area and sound judgment will surely go far to speed fulfillment of our aims, and those of our [NORP] neighbors. This project will be brought into existence. I shall continue to recommend [ORG] construction of such beneficial projects. New ones will be started. Such activities as these, my friends, are obviously, as [PERSON] said, the legitimate object of government. But here let us draw our line as he himself did, when he went on to say this: In all that the people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere. It is not properly a Federal responsibility to try to supply all the power needs of our people. [ORG] should no more attempt to do so than it should assume responsibility for supplying all their drinking water, their food, their housing, and their transportation. To attempt such a centralization of authority and responsibility always starts a deadly cycle. Parenthetically, may I remark that a region which lets itself become completely dependent upon national funds provided by a [ORG]-which [ORG] represents not that region alone but the whole [ORG]-would frequently find that the funds fail to keep pace with local needs. But the important thing is that as [ORG] power expands in a region-and I mean [ORG] authority and responsibility--local enterprise comes increasingly intimidated and discouraged, even though the needs for energy continue to grow. Thus still more [ORG] intervention becomes necessary. Such a conversion of local regions into [ORG] satellites poses a threat deadly to our liberties. The [ORG] in [GPE]--and the present leadership in [ORG]--are unalterably opposed to such malignant growth of bureaucracy. In our devotion to conservation, let us not forget that there are spiritual as well as physical values to protect. Above all else, we must protect the freedom and the spirit of independence of our people in our [GPE] and counties, in our cities and towns. Determination to have this kind of freedom gave us this Nation. It brought your ancestors to this Western country. That determination is not only the surest protector of our liberties, it is the principal ingredient in our national prosperity. Yet, there are some who contend that the development and distribution of hydro-electric power is exclusively the responsibility of [ORG]. They argue that to permit any State or local government or any private company under governmental regulation to develop such power capacity is to give to a special group an asset belonging to all the Nation. Indeed, in some instances, these disciples of centralized responsibility and authority insist that since [ORG] should provide all hydro-electric power, it should likewise eliminate competition by providing steam-electric power as well. Only thus, these zealots would have us believe, can we poor citizens be protected against exploitation against what they call the predatory exponents of capitalism--that is, free enterprise. Now, let us have a quick look at this matter. In the first place it is, of course, not difficult to be generous with someone else's money. So the individual who wants to build power dams only with [ORG] money is not directly or particularly concerned with the economic necessity of the project or with the suitability of its location. Secondly, these advocates of centralized government shut their eyes to the remarkable development of this [ORG] during [DATE]. They must wonder how such prosperity came about when communities and citizens were free to look after themselves--including their own protection against the so-called local interests. These believers in centralization fail to warn us that monopoly is always potentially dangerous to freedom--even when monopoly is exercised by the Government. Curiously enough, they proclaim their fear of a private power monopoly in a county, city or State, but they urge upon us all a gigantic, overwhelming, nationwide power monopoly. But, of course, they also see themselves as the all-wise directors of that monopoly-so all would be well. monopoly, nor do they want a system leading toward it. They know The [NORP] people do not want and do not need to have any such they can have all the power capacity of our streams developed, as needed, without forfeiting the advantages of local responsibility and participation. Throughout our country are many public enterprises--organized [DATE] by [ORG], municipalities, and other public agencies--which have long been in successful operation. In [CARDINAL] of other instances, power has been and is being provided by private enterprise under the regulatory processes in the particular governmental agency involved. In each instance the people directly concerned by such operations have themselves decided whether they are best served by public or by private agencies. The issue is not, therefore, public power versus unregulated private power. The issue posed to us is [ORG] monopoly of power, as against public or regulated power, freely chosen in each instance by the citizens of each area, with [ORG] coming in as a cooperating partner where this seems necessary or desirable. [DATE], for example, [ORG] and local governments were invited to cooperate in power generation without the threat of [ORG] power control. During this brief period numerous local public agencies and private investors have applied for licenses to build hydro-electric plants. These applications in this Northwest region amount to [QUANTITY]. This represents a prospective investment of not less than one and one-half billion dollars. Well over half of this would be invested by public power--not private power--interests. But the seekers after [ORG] control of energy are not silenced even by this array of facts. They say that construction of power projects by local enterprise will impede the comprehensive development of this or other river basins. Now again--let us take a look at the facts. What they say just is not true. All power projects must be licensed by [ORG]. Before the [ORG] grants a license, it must see evidence that the project makes maximum use of the developed resources. It makes no difference who builds the projects-Federal, [ORG], municipal, or private agencies. These requirements apply--regardless. We should also get this straight: when a project is licensed before a [ORG], it is not removed from public control. Rates and services remain under regulation. And when the licensing period ends, the site can be assumed by [ORG]. I happen to hold this conviction: that, here in the Northwest, your own public agencies and your own private companies--operating under both [ORG] regulation and your own eagle eyes out here--can work in the public interest at least as well as some far-off [ORG] agency. They ought to do better. At this moment there are glowing reports on your regional efforts to work out your own problems. Through [ORG], Governors [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON] are doing great work in assuring this area of adequate supplies of water. More benefits will flow from efforts to further [ORG] cooperation on problems that cross the borders of [GPE]. I am especially happy that the power produced by this great new dam will contribute to the finest type of cooperative effort--your own [FAC]. This arrangement is an admirable modal of voluntary pooling of public and private generating and transmission facilities. Because of it, you citizens of the Northwest have [QUANTITY] of additional prime power that would not exist through independent operation of your various utilities. And in addition--and very important--you have it under your own control--not under the permission of a far-off [GPE] office holder. This is a splendid partnership--the kind that the [ORG] will continue to encourage. I might add that this partnership concept has been most ably advanced by your [NORP] delegation in the [ORG], led by Senator [PERSON]. My friends, in all of these things that I have mentioned, your goal and the goal of your Government are exactly the same: to assure each citizen of enough kilowatts, when he wants them, where he wants them, at the lowest competitive cost--with the least likelihood of bureaucratic domination from [GPE], D.C. In this effort, we shall avoid extremes. We shall neither withdraw from the power field nor will we federalize all electric power generators in [GPE]. Instead, we shall continue to advance in a spirit of helpfulness to localities, and in a spirit of cooperation with local citizens. Where local enterprise can shoulder the burden, it will be encouraged and supported in doing so. And where local action cannot or should not fully meet the need, we shall have Federal action. In this way, our people, in their communities and homes throughout [GPE], shall reserve to themselves as many of the basic decisions affecting their lives as possible. In this way, our people will remain free to carve out their destinies as their predecessors did. It was in this spirit that those who preceded you in the great Northwest, in [DATE], turned an unsettled wilderness into an inland empire--an empire vastly enriched by this gigantic structure which [DATE] we so proudly name [FAC]. Now, my friends, I know that the policy I have outlined for you will satisfy neither group that exists at the extreme ends of this argument. It is not intended to please them. This program, as all other programs in which your Government engages, is designed to benefit [GPE] million people. It is guided and formulated on the advice, the commonsense counsel of the vast majority of [NORP]. Extremes do not interest me, or the [ORG], in the slightest. Fellow citizens, we have talked [DATE] especially of power and water and this great new dam. But it is well that we remind ourselves that these are but part of a commonly-held objective which transcends all partisan and sectional considerations. The objective is that this Republic shall in every way grow ever stronger and more secure--that it may remain at peace in a world freed of the threat of atomic war. We want our [GPE] to have an ever growing, vigorous economy. We want every citizen to prosper and advance--with freedoms which daily shine brighter in each community of our land. We shall continue to build the material, moral, and intellectual strength to assure ourselves and our children of an always finer [DATE]. Toward that stronger and better [GPE], my friends, I know that you will continue to go forward, as self-reliant, courageous descendants of God-fearing pioneers, fortified by your faith in yourselves and in your country. As you travel that wonderful road, I trust that you will have full confidence, every step of the way, that your [ORG] strides beside you as your true partner. May you always be sure that this [ORG] is ready to help where necessary, eager as your servant to make the way easier for you and for all. But it will never be willing to assume over you a domination that will rob you of your greatest heritage--your individual liberty and your maximum control over your personal, family and local concerns. That, my friends, is the kind of government, the kind of [GPE], of which your children and mine will be as proud as we are of our country [DATE]. And now, of course, without a pushbutton, no dedication is possible. General [PERSON] has explained to you the workings of this instrument-what will happen about the lights and the sounds--about what will happen in sending an electric current to some machinery--about the lights going on--and then this great and inspiring marvel, [FAC]--another portion of it, will be furnishing power to [FAC]. It is with the greatest sense of distinction and pride in [ORG] part of what was done in this project that I now, by this act, officially dedicate [FAC]. Thank you very much, my friends--thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsannualmessagethecongressthestatetheunion27", "text": "AboutSearch Mr. [PERSON], Mr. President, Members of the [ORG] and the [ORG], my fellow [NORP]: I come before you [TIME] to report on the State of the Union for the third time. I come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the Nation's gratitude for this, the 89th [ORG]. This [ORG] has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of [GPE]. Our Nation [TIME] is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in [GPE]. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just must be the center of our concerns. But we will not permit those who fire upon us in [GPE] to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the [NORP] people. This [ORG] is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home. And that is what I have come here to ask of you [TIME]. I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law [DATE]. I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty. I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth. I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between [GPE] and Eastern Europe and [GPE]. I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in [GPE]. I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins. I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire [ORG] system from prevention to probation. I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in [ORG] and [ORG] jury selection, by making it a serious [ORG] crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline [ORG] by creating a new [ORG] level [ORG] and reorganizing several existing agencies. In turn, I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both required as well as rewarded. I will ask you to make it possible for Members of [ORG] to work more effectively in the service of the Nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to [DATE], concurrent with that of the [SPEAKER]. II. Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it. We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop [ORG]. [DATE] alone the wealth that we produced increased [MONEY], and it will soar again [DATE] to a total over [MONEY]. Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend [TIME], our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in [DATE]. It will be [MONEY] [DATE]. Total spending in the administrative budget will be [MONEY]. Revenues [DATE] will be [MONEY]. On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the Federal budget [DATE] will actually show a surplus. That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government [DATE] will collect [MONEY] more than it will spend in [DATE]. I have not come here [TIME] to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures. I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest [ORG] on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow [NORP]. There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask them: Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor? Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make them. But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty. I believe that we can continue [ORG] while we fight in [GPE]. But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need. And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope [TIME]. [CARDINAL] of their servants and their protectors sit before me [TIME] here in this great [FAC]. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] leads us along [CARDINAL] roads growth and justice and liberation. [[CARDINAL].] First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress. I can report to you [TIME] what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside. This Nation is flourishing. Workers are making more money than ever with after-tax income in [DATE] up [PERCENT]; in [DATE], up [PERCENT]. More people are working than ever before in our history an increase [DATE] of [CARDINAL] jobs. Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For [DATE] those earnings have been up [PERCENT], and [DATE] alone they had a rise of [PERCENT]. Average farm income is higher than ever. Over [DATE] it is up [PERCENT], and over [DATE] it is up [PERCENT] alone. I was informed [TIME] by the distinguished Secretary of the [ORG] that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from [MONEY] in [DATE] to [MONEY], or less, in [DATE]. This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government. We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in [DATE]. And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again [TIME]. I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective [DATE]. Without raising taxes or even increasing the total tax bill paid we should move to improve our withholding system so that [NORP] can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date. I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of [GPE] require it, I will not hesitate to return to the [ORG] for additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed. [[CARDINAL].] The second road is justice. Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin. I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in [ORG] and [ORG] courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements. I propose legislation to strengthen authority of [ORG] courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime. Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of [ORG], to 'prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. For that other nation within a Nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of [GPE], I will ask the [ORG] not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience. To improve the life of our rural [NORP] and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new [ORG], improved education through the use of [ORG] teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources. For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14 of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our [GPE] equal to the laws of the [CARDINAL] States which do not have [TIME] right-to-work measures. And I also intend to ask the [ORG] to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest. [[CARDINAL].] The third path is the path of liberation. It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives. A great nation is one which breeds a great people. A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius. That alone is [ORG]. Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome. We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to our lives if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people. [DATE] we must continue to improve the quality of [NORP] life. Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of [DATE], extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces. I urge [ORG] to complete action on [CARDINAL] programs already passed by the [ORG] the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for [GPE]. In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, [CARDINAL], 000 people. Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life. I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas. Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air. We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people. To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces. Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured. Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways. I will propose a Highway Safety Act of [DATE] to seek an end to this mounting tragedy. We must also act to prevent the deception of the [NORP] consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores. It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of [NORP] political invention. We must change to master change. I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch, to modernize the relations between city and [ORG] and [ORG]. A new [ORG] is needed to bring together our transportation activities. The present structure [CARDINAL] Government agencies, spending [MONEY] [DATE] makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great [ORG] or the needs of the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality. I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly [CARDINAL] times the speed of sound in excess of [QUANTITY]. I propose to examine our Federal system-the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the [NORP] people. As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors. Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and [ORG] committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions-and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice. To strengthen the work of [ORG] I strongly urge an amendment to provide a [DATE] term for Members of [ORG]-which should not begin before [DATE]. The present [DATE] term requires most Members of [ORG] to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom. [DATE], too, the work of government is far more complex than in [DATE], requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life. The [ORG], the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a [DATE] term for Members of the [ORG]. And I urge your swift action. IV. [TIME] the cup of peril is full in [GPE]. That conflict is not an isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War II. The touchstone of that policy is the interest of [GPE] the welfare and the freedom of the people of [GPE]. But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass. In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster. An [GPE] that is mighty beyond description-yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man. In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to [GPE] and [GPE], and we defended the freedom of [GPE]. In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have extended the helping hand of [ORG] and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world. And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice. In this pursuit we have defended against [NORP] aggression in [GPE] under President Trumanin the Formosa Straits under President [PERSON] in [GPE] under President [PERSON] and again in [GPE]. [TIME] [GPE] must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the [NORP] Nation. I will discuss them fully in [DATE], and I will follow the [CARDINAL] continuing lines of policy that [GPE] has followed under its last [CARDINAL] Presidents. [[CARDINAL].] The first principle is strength. [TIME] I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments. We will need expenditures of [MONEY] for [DATE] to maintain this necessary defense might. While special [GPE] expenditures for [DATE] are estimated to increase by [MONEY], I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire [ORG] budget will rise [DATE] by [MONEY]. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in [ORG], and followed by the other departments of [ORG]. [[CARDINAL].] A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction. We will vigorously pursue existing proposals-and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. [[CARDINAL].] A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world. By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world. We will take new steps [DATE] to help strengthen [ORG], the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme association [ORG]. We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to trade, and to improve international finance. [[CARDINAL].] A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man. From the [PERSON] plan to [TIME] [TIME], that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands. [DATE] I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves. We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance. We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great [GPE], in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture. We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966. I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during [DATE]; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts. In [DATE], from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate [MONEY] to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world. [[CARDINAL].] The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institutions. For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself. We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule. We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of [CARDINAL] race by another. We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe. And I will ask the [ORG] for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West. The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of [DATE]'s world in which we live. In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will. It is eroding the unity of what was once a [NORP] empire. In [DATE] a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland [GPE]. History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system or belief unless force is used to make it so. That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy, to defend it in [GPE], in [GPE], in [GPE]-and [TIME] in [GPE]. For [TIME], as so many nights before, young [NORP] struggle and young [NORP] die in a distant land. [TIME], as so many nights before, [ORG] is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom. How many times in my lifetime and in yours have the [NORP] people gathered, as they do now, to hear their [SPEAKER] tell them of conflict and tell them of danger? Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this Nation required. And they do again [TIME] in [GPE]. Not too many years ago [GPE] was a peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent [NORP] government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of [GPE]. There were some in [GPE] who wished to force [NORP] rule on their own people. But their progress was slight. Their hope of success was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, [GPE] decided on conquest. And from [DATE] to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression. As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave, abandoning [GPE] to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of [GPE]. We stayed. And we will stay until aggression has stopped. We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on [GPE]'s solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of [CARDINAL] [NORP] [SPEAKER]s. We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in [GPE]'s word and in [GPE]'s protection. To yield to force in [GPE] would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in [CARDINAL] land, and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of Asia to the domination of [NORP]. And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest. [DATE] the nature of the war in [GPE] changed again. Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South. Attack and terror increased, spurred and encouraged by the belief that [GPE] lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near. Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to make our firmness clear to the North. Thus. we began limited air action against military targets in [GPE]. We increased our fighting force to its present strength [TIME] of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] men. These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success. The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of [NORP] and their allies and by the enduring courage of [NORP] who, I can tell you, have lost [CARDINAL] men [DATE] for every [CARDINAL] of ours. The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side. There is no cause to doubt the [NORP] commitment. Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace. In [DATE] alone we had [CARDINAL] private talks for peace in [GPE], with friends and adversaries throughout the world. Since [DATE] your Government has labored again, with imagination and endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement. For [DATE] now we and our [NORP] allies have dropped no bombs in [GPE]. Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of [GPE], [CARDINAL] countries. We have talked to [CARDINAL] governments, [CARDINAL] that we have relations with, and some that we do not . We have talked to [ORG] and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace. In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to friends, in [GPE] and [GPE], in [GPE] and [GPE], in Africa and throughout this hemisphere, [GPE] has made her position abundantly clear. We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in [GPE]. We fight for the principle of self-determination that the people of [GPE] should be able to choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear. The people of all [GPE] should make a free decision on the great question of reunification. This is all we want for [GPE]. It is all the people of [GPE] want. And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard. We have also made it clear from [GPE] to [GPE] that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements of [DATE] and [DATE]. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any proposals [CARDINAL] points or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] and we will consider the views of any group. We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have begun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once [GPE] is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future. We have said all this, and we have asked-and hoped and we have waited for a response. So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure. We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes. We have found understanding and support. And we know they wait with us [TIME] for some response that could lead to peace. I wish [TIME] that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over [DATE], but we just cannot know what the future may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once. Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger. But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every dollar, and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge. And we will continue to help the people of [GPE] care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war. And let me be absolutely clear: [DATE] may become [DATE], and [DATE] may become [DATE], but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle. There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in [GPE] is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will. But for others it must now be clear the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose. The people of [GPE], North and South, seek the same things: the shared needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny. For [DATE], in war and revolution and infrequent peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs. It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death. To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again [TIME]: Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the servant of life. In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve. V. This is the State of the Union. But over it all wealth, and promise, and expectation lies our troubling awareness of [NORP] men at war [TIME]. How many men who listen to me [TIME] have served their Nation in other wars? How very many are not here to listen? The war in [GPE] is not like these other wars. Yet, finally, war is always the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise. It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate. Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world. Many of you share the burden of this knowledge [TIME] with me. But there is a difference. For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire. For we have children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed. There are poor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a world to be helped. Yet we do what we must. I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires. Yet as long as others will challenge [GPE]'s security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of [DATE] tremble. I believe [TIME] that you do not want me to try that risk. And from that belief your [SPEAKER] summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in [DATE] to come. The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth. Thank you, and goodnight.", "discourse_type": 0}

I realize that my brother, [PERSON], was the first choice. [Laughter] I understand that the Southern Legislative Conference--[laughter]could not afford [PERSON] here. I was going to go by Plains on this trip, but I could not get a room there. [Laughter] I am going to go to [GPE] [TIME] and then to [GPE] later on. I am very grateful to be here as President of our country. I have learned a lot in [DATE]. When I got to [GPE] and sought advice, someone said, Just act like you are a President and treat [ORG] like [ORG]. It did not work at first. [Laughter] Very quickly I realized that the [ORG] was treating me like I was still Governor of [GPE], but now, with the help of a great number of friends in the [ORG], we have formed a kind of relationship that ought to exist between [ORG] and our Nation's [FAC]. I think there is a genuine sense of sharing of responsibility and the burden of government, and you are a part of that circle of leaders in the [ORG] legislature and the Governors' offices, who join in with the President, the [ORG], and others in making sure that our government works. I have become even more proud of being an [NORP]. And I have become even more proud of being a [NORP], too. I am also proud to be with you [DATE] where [CARDINAL] great rivers come together, as they say in [GPE], to form the Atlantic Ocean. This is one of our Nation's most gracious cities. And I want to talk to you [DATE] about the hopes and problems that we as [NORP] and as [NORP] share together. I feel a special kinship with your State legislators. For [DATE] I was a member of [ORG], and I still prize State government not only for the talents of those who work in it but, as [PERSON] says, for the closeness to the people it represents. Our [NORP] States have a proud tradition of local, independent government, and now you are the heirs of that tradition. But we in the South have also felt, perhaps more directly than many others, some of the rapid changes that have taken place in this modern age. More and more our own lives are shaped by events in other cities, decisions in other [GPE], tensions in other parts of the world. And as [NORP] we cannot overlook the way that our fate is bound to that of other nations. This interdependence stretches from the health of our economy, through war and peace, to the security of our own energy supplies. It is a new world in which we cannot afford to be narrow in our vision, limited in our foresight, or selfish in our purpose. When I took office [DATE], our Nation was faced with a series of problems around the world--in southern Africa, the Middle East, in our relationships with our [ORG] allies, and on such tough questions as nuclear proliferation, negotiations with our former adversaries, a [FAC] treaty, human rights, world poverty. We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and controversial issues--some of which had been either skirted or postponed in the past. As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate, disagreement, probing was inevitable. Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and lasting. Now, a President has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure as President making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you and understood and debated by the [ORG]. In the past I think our [ORG]'s leaders have been guilty of making decisions in secret. And even when the decision turns out to be the fight one, it makes the President, the Secretary of [ORG] speak with a weak voice when they speak alone. [DATE], I want to discuss a vitally important aspect of our foreign relations, the one that may most directly shape the chances for peace for us and for our children. I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and where we are going in our relations with [GPE] and to reaffirm the basic principles of our national policy. I do not have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the [NORP] people. For [DATE], the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between [CARDINAL] coalitions, [CARDINAL] headed by [GPE] and the other headed by [GPE]. Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with [GPE]. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern us both. Even if we succeed in relaxing tensions with the [GPE], we could still awake [DATE] to find that nuclear weapons have been spread to [CARDINAL] of other nations who may not be as responsible as are we. Or we could struggle to limit the conventional arsenals of our [CARDINAL] nations, to reduce the danger of war, only to undo our efforts by continuing without constraint to export armaments around the world. As [CARDINAL] industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises. Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas. Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of international relations. [GPE] and [GPE] rose from the rubble of war to become great economic powers. [NORP] parties and governments have become more widespread and more varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant. Both [GPE] and [GPE] have learned that our countries and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We have learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity. I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think that to understand [DATE]'s [NORP]-American relationship, we must place it in perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene. The whole history of [NORP]-American relations teaches us that we will be misled if we base our long-range policies on the mood of the moment, whether that mood be euphoric or grim. All of us can remember times when relations seemed especially dangerous and other times when they seemed especially bright. We have crossed those peaks and valleys before. And we can see that, on balance, the trend in [DATE] has been positive. The profound differences in what our [CARDINAL] governments believe about freedom and power and the inner lives of human beings, those differences are likely to remain; and so are other elements of competition between [GPE] and [GPE]. That competition is real and deeply rooted in the history and the values of our respective societies. But it is also true that our [CARDINAL] countries share many important overlapping interests. Our job---my job, your job--is to explore those shared interests and use them to enlarge the areas of cooperation between us on a basis of equality and mutual respect. As we negotiate with [GPE], we will be guided by a vision of a gentler, freer, and more bountiful world. But we will have no illusions about the nature of the world as it really is. The basis for complete mutual trust between us does not yet exist. Therefore, the agreements that we reach must be anchored on each side in enlightened self-interest-what is best for us, what is best for [GPE]. That is why we search for areas of agreement where our real interests and those of the [NORP] coincide. We want to see the [NORP] further engaged in the growing pattern of international activities designed to deal with human problems--not only because they can be of real help but because we both should be seeking for a greater stake in the creation of a constructive and peaceful world order. When I took office, many [NORP] were growing disillusioned with detente---President [PERSON] had even quit using the word, and by extension, people were concerned with the whole course of our relations with [GPE]. Also, and perhaps more seriously, world respect for the essential rightness of [NORP] foreign policy had been shaken by the events of [DATE]---[GPE], [GPE], [ORG], Watergate. At the same time, we were beginning to regain our sense of confidence and our purpose and unity as a nation. In this situation, I decided that it was time for honest discussions about international issues with the [NORP] people. I felt that it was urgent to restore the moral bearings of [NORP] foreign policy. And I felt that it was important to put the [GPE] and [NORP] relationship, in particular, on a more reciprocal, realistic, and, ultimately, more productive basis for both nations. It is not a question of a hard policy or of a soft policy, but of a clear-eyed recognition of how most effectively to protect our own security and to create the kind of international order that I have just described. This is our goal. We have looked at the problems in [NORP]-American relations in a fresh way, and we have sought to deal with them boldly and constructively with proposals intended to produce concrete results. I'd like to point out just a few of them. In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions, limitations, and a freeze on new technology which would maintain balanced strategic strength. We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in [GPE] relations. We are working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we have asked [GPE], [GPE], and other countries to join with us in this effort. We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives. We have undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We have encouraged the [NORP] to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere. We have begun regular consultations with the [NORP] leaders as cochairmen of the prospective [GPE] conference to promote peace in the Middle East. We and our allies are negotiating together with [GPE] and their allies in the [ORG] nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe. We have renewed the [DATE] agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space. We are seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger. In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance. We have outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists. The [GPE] negotiations of [DATE] left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation. Meanwhile, new developments in technology have created new concerns--the cruise missile, the very large intercontinental ballistic missiles of the [NORP]. The [NORP] are worried about our cruise missiles, and we are concerned about the security of our own deterrent capability. Our cruise missiles are aimed at compensating for the growing threat to our deterrent, represented by the buildup of strategic [NORP] offensive weapons forces. If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that [GPE] can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture. Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation. But none of these proposals that I have outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well. When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I am not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, [NORP] and [NORP], that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our [CARDINAL] countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we will also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life. We have made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the [NORP] side about [ORG] and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the [NORP] are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us, let no one doubt that we will persevere. What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we hope the [NORP] will do the same. Together we can give this change a positive direction. Increased trade between [GPE] and [GPE] would help us both. [ORG]-Soviet [ORG] has resumed its meetings after a long interlude. I hope that conditions can be created that will make possible steps toward expanded trade. In southern Africa we have pressed for [NORP] and [NORP] restraint. Throughout the nonaligned world, our goal is not to encourage dissension or to redivide the world into opposing ideological camps, but to expand the realm of independent, economically self-reliant nations, and to oppose attempts at new kinds of subjugation. Part of the [GPE] leaders' current attitude may be due to their apparent-and incorrect--belief that our concern for human rights is aimed specifically at them or is an attack on their vital interests. There are no hidden meanings in our commitment to human rights. We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. Our policy is exactly what it appears to be: the positive and sincere expression of our deepest beliefs as a people. It is addressed not to any particular people or area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own country. And it is specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the cold war. On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our own country [DATE] has proved this over and over again. We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations of the world. We are going to do that. In [DATE] we have made clear our determination--both to give voice to [NORP]' fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice. We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction. I cannot forecast whether all our efforts will succeed. But there are things which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very briefly. This place where I now stand is one of the oldest cities in [GPE]. It is a beautiful town of whose culture and urban charm all [NORP] are proud--just as the people of [GPE] are justly proud of such ancient cities as [GPE] or [GPE], which there they lovingly preserve, as you do in [GPE], and into which they infuse a new life that makes these cities far more than just dead remnants of a glorious historical past. Although there are deep differences in our values and ideas, we [NORP] and [NORP] belong to the same civilization whose origins stretch back [DATE]. Beyond all the disagreements between us--and beyond the cool calculations of mutual self-interest that our [CARDINAL] countries bring to the negotiating table--is the invisible human reality that must bring us closer together. I mean the yearning for peace, real peace, that is in the very bones of us all. I am absolutely certain that the people of [GPE], who have suffered so grievously in war, feel this yearning for peace. And in this they are at one with the people of [GPE]. It is up to all of us to help make that unspoken passion into something more than just a dream. And that responsibility falls most heavily on those like you, of course, but particularly like President [PERSON] and me, who hold in our hands the terrible power conferred on us by the modern engines of war. Mr. [PERSON] said something very interesting recently, and I quote from his speech: It is our belief, our firm belief, he said, that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately triumph, and mankind will be able to step into [DATE] in conditions of peace, stable as never before. I see no hidden meaning in that. I credit its sincerity. And I express the same hope and belief that Mr. [PERSON] expressed. With all the difficulties, all the conflicts, I believe that our planet must finally obey the [NORP] injunction to follow after the things which make for peace. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexcerptsthepresidentsnewsconference160", "text": "AboutSearch I do not know how many of you are thinking of going with me up to the Adirondacks, as many as can I hope. Those who go I shall see up there. Those who stay in [GPE] I shall not of course see, and I wish to take this opportunity to express my amazement at the constant correctness of my views as you report them to the country. It is very seldom that any error creeps in. I do not know how that could be done. I would not be able to report as correctly the views of any one of you. I do not know how you get before the country so clearly and so well my views as you do. And I also want to thank you for the consideration with which you have always treated the Presidential office during the time that I have been President. It has been very helpful to me in the transaction of the public business and I think very helpful to the country in coming to a comprehension of what the Government is trying to do, how it is trying to function, what efforts it is making to benefit the condition of the people. I hope those of you that stay here or go to some other part of the country will have the opportunity to have as pleasant a summer as I expect to have and as those who go with me I know will have. I would like to say also that I am very much gratified with the work that the [ORG] did. There was a very large amount of constructive legislation. The principal thing that will affect the country is the reduction of taxation. I was not able to do a great lot with the reduc-tion of expenditures, but we did keep expenditures down fairly well. There was no bill of general importance that passed that I did not approve. There were [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] small things. I sent up a couple of veto messages of personal and local significance and there were [CARDINAL] bills that I decided not to sign. [CARDINAL] of them I had not been able to make up my mind about it. That is the bill relative to taxation of lands in [GPE] and [GPE]. That did not come in until just as I was about to leave the office to go to lunch and from lunch to the [FAC], so I did not have a chance to investigate it. I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation. The approval of [ORG] and the manifest desire to place that on a basis where its independence would be made more secure than it is now, leaving the other nations to approve that policy, is a matter of importance in international relations. I think that there was not much of anything in the way of treaties. The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas did not come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the [ORG]. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to [ORG]. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through [DATE] in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by [ORG], a considerable step in advance. There are some things that remain to be done. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in [DATE] as a result of conferences between the Secretary of [ORG] and [ORG] that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. There are some things that have been left undone. [GPE] has not been finally determined. I spoke of the [CARDINAL] treaties. Coal legislation has not been finally passed upon. And legislation for the consolidation of railroads. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this [ORG]. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that did not have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the [ORG] act upon I secured favorable action. I do not want to make the personal pronoun there too large. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present [ORG] was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the [ORG] or too much subservience to the wishes of the [ORG]. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions. There is another item that I left out, which of course is of tremendous importance, and that is the settlement of our foreign debts. I would place that as one of the major accomplishments of the last [ORG]. I did not make any memo, and I presume that after you are away several others will occur to me of important achievements. You have my consent to put those in, if any of you think of them.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat15", "text": "[DATE] have gone by since I last spoke to the people of the [ORG] about the state of the [ORG]. I had hoped to be able to defer this talk until [DATE] because, as we all know, this is [DATE]. But what I want to say to you, the people of the country, is of such immediate need and relates so closely to the lives of human beings and the prevention of human suffering that I have felt that there should be no delay. In this decision I have been strengthened by the thought that by speaking [TIME] there may be greater peace of mind and the hope of [DATE] may be more real at firesides everywhere, and that it is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are thinking of [PERSON]. [DATE] we faced a very serious problem of economic and social recovery. For [DATE] that recovery proceeded apace. It is only in [DATE] that it has received a visible setback. And it is only within [DATE], as we have waited patiently to see whether the forces of business itself would counteract it, that it has become apparent that government itself can no longer safely fail to take aggressive government steps to meet it. This recession has not returned us to the disasters and suffering of [DATE]. Your money in the bank is safe; farmers are no longer in deep distress and have greater purchasing power; dangers of security speculation have been minimized; national income is [PERCENT] cent higher than in [DATE]; and government has an established and accepted responsibility for relief. But I know that many of you have lost your jobs or have seen your friends or members of your families lose their jobs, and I do not propose that the government shall pretend not to see these things. I know that the effect of our present difficulties has been uneven; that they have affected some groups and some localities seriously, but that they have been scarcely felt in others. But I conceive the first duty of government is to protect the economic welfare of all the people in all sections and in all groups. I said in my message opening the last session of [ORG] that if private enterprise did not provide jobs [DATE], government would take up the slack that I would not let the people down. We have all learned the lesson that government cannot afford to wait until it has lost the power to act. Therefore, I have sent a message of far-reaching importance to the [ORG]. I want to read to you [TIME] certain passages from that message, and to talk with you about them. In that message I analyzed the causes of the collapse of [DATE] in these words: overspeculation in and overproduction of practically every article or instrument used by man . . . [CARDINAL] of people had been put to work, but the products of their hands had exceeded the purchasing power of their pocketbooks. . . .Under the inexorable law of supply and demand, supplies so overran demand which would pay that production was compelled to stop. Unemployment and closed factories resulted. Hence [DATE] from [DATE]. I pointed out to the [ORG] that the national income not the Government's income, but the total of the income of all the individual citizens and families of [GPE] every farmer, every worker, every banker, every professional man and every person who lived on income derived from investments that national income amounted, in [DATE], to [MONEY]. By [DATE] this had fallen to [MONEY]. Gradually, and up to [DATE], it had risen to a total of [MONEY] a pretty good come-back from the low point. I then said this to the [ORG]: But the very vigor of the recovery in both durable goods and consumers' goods brought into the picture early in [DATE] certain highly undesirable practices, which were in large part responsible for the economic decline which began in [DATE]. Again production outran the ability to buy. There were many reasons for this overproduction. [CARDINAL] was fear fear of war abroad, fear of inflation, fear of nationwide strikes. None of these fears has been borne out. . . . Production in many important lines of goods outran the ability of the public to purchase them. For example, through [DATE] cotton factories in [CARDINAL] of cases were running on a [CARDINAL]-shift basis, piling up cotton goods in the factory and in the hands of middle men and retailers. For example, also, automobile manufacturers not only turned out a normal increase of finished cars, but encouraged the normal increase to run into abnormal figures, using every known method to push their sales. This meant, of course, that the steel mills of the [ORG] ran on a [TIME] basis, and the tire companies and cotton factories speeded up to meet the same type of abnormally stimulated demand. The buying power of the [ORG] lagged behind. Thus by [DATE] the [ORG] again had stocks on hand which the consuming public could not buy because the purchasing power of the consuming public had not kept pace with the production. During the same period the prices of many vital products had risen faster than was warranted. . . . In the case of many commodities the price to the consumer was raised well above the inflationary boom prices of [DATE]. In many lines of goods and materials, prices got so high that buyers and builders ceased to buy or to build. . . . The economic process of getting out the raw materials, putting them through the manufacturing and finishing processes, selling them to the retailers, selling them to the consumer, and finally using them got completely out of balance. ... The laying off of workers came upon us [DATE] and has been continuing at such a pace ever since that all of us, Government and banking and business and workers, and those faced with destitution, recognize the need for action. All of this I said to the [ORG] [DATE] and I repeat it to you, the people of the country [TIME]. I went on to point out to the [ORG] and [ORG] that all the energies of government and business must be directed to increasing the national income, to putting more people into private jobs, to giving security and a feeling of security to all people in all walks of life. I am constantly thinking of all our people unemployed and employed alike- of their human problems of food and clothing and homes and education and health and old age. You and I agree that security is our greatest need; the chance to work, the opportunity of making a reasonable profit in our business-whether it be a very small business or a larger one the possibility of selling our farm products for enough money for our families to live on decently. I know these are the things that decide the well-being of all our people. Therefore, I am determined to do all in my power to help you attain that security, and because I know that the people themselves have a deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind cannot be a lasting one except on a basis of business fair dealing and a basis where all from top to bottom share in prosperity, I repeated to the [ORG] [DATE] that neither it nor the Chief Executive can afford to weaken or destroy great reforms which, during [DATE], have been effected on behalf of the [NORP] people. In our rehabilitation of the banking structure and of agriculture, in our provisions for adequate and cheaper credit for all types of business, in our acceptance of national responsibility for unemployment relief, in our strengthening of the credit of state and local government, in our encouragement of housing, slum clearance and home ownership, in our supervision of stock exchanges and public utility holding companies and the issuance of new securities, in our provision for social security, the electorate of [GPE] wants no backward steps taken. We have recognized the right of labor to free organization, to collective bargaining; and machinery for the handling of labor relations is now in existence. The principles are established even though we can all admit that, through the evolution of time, administration and practices can be improved. Such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts to understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers alike. The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problems which will require new adjustments. Our immediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved. In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any [NORP] to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and enterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty. I came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for action both by the Government and by the people, that we suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buying power. It is up to us to create an economic upturn. How and where can and should the Government help to start an upward spiral? I went on to propose [CARDINAL] groups of measures and I will summarize the recommendations. First, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to keep the Government expenditures for work relief and similar purposes during [DATE] at the same rate of expenditure as at present. That includes additional money for [ORG]; additional funds for [ORG]; additional allotments for [ORG], and more money for [ORG], in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps now in operation. These appropriations, made necessary by increased unemployment, will cost [CARDINAL] more than the estimates which I sent to the [ORG] on [DATE]. Second, I told the [ORG] that the [ORG] proposes to make additional bank reserves available for the credit needs of the country. [MONEY] of gold now in the [ORG] will be used to pay these additional expenses of the Government, and [MONEY] of additional credit will be made available to the banks by reducing the reserves now required by [ORG]. These [CARDINAL] steps, taking care of relief needs and adding to bank credits, are in our judgment insufficient by themselves to start the Nation on a sustained upward movement. Therefore, I came to the third kind of Government action which I consider to be vital. I said to the [ORG]: You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with [CARDINAL] rounds of ammunition where [CARDINAL] rounds are necessary. If we stop at relief and credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the enemy is routed. If we are fully equipped with the third round of ammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity. The third proposal is to make definite additions to the purchasing power of the [ORG] by providing new work over and above the continuing of the old work. First, to enable [ORG] to undertake the immediate construction of [MONEY] of additional slum clearance projects. Second, to renew a public works program by starting as quickly as possible [MONEY] worth of needed permanent public improvements in states, counties and cities. Third, to add [MONEY] to the estimate for federal aid highways in excess of the amount I recommended in [DATE]. Fourth, to add [MONEY] over and above the former estimate of [MONEY] for flood control and reclamation. Fifth, to add [MONEY] additional for federal buildings in various parts of the country. In recommending this program I am thinking not only of the immediate economic needs of the people of the [ORG], but also of their personal liberties the most precious possession of all [NORP]. I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend in other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal. Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations-not because the people of those nations disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and government weakness through lack of leadership in government. Finally, in desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. We in [GPE] know that our own democratic institutions can be preserved and made to work. But in order to preserve them we need to act together, to meet the problems of the [ORG] boldly, and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government is equal to the task of protecting the security of the people. Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our Government to give employment to idle men. The people of [GPE] are in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the first line of that defense lies in the protection of economic security. Your Government, seeking to protect democracy, must prove that Government is stronger than the forces of business depression. History proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and successful governments, but out of weak and helpless ones. If by democratic methods people get a government strong enough to protect them from fear and starvation, their democracy succeeds; but if they do not, they grow impatient. Therefore, the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over its government. We are a rich Nation; we can afford to pay for security and prosperity without having to sacrifice our liberties in the bargain. In [DATE] of our republic we were short of capital, short of workers and short of industrial production; but we were rich in free land, free timber and free mineral wealth. [ORG] rightly assumed the duty of promoting business and relieving depression by giving subsidies of land and other resources. Thus, from [DATE] we have had a tradition of substantial government help to our system of private enterprise. But [DATE] the government no longer has vast tracts of rich land to give away and we have discovered that we must spend large sums to conserve our land from further erosion and our forests from further depletion. The situation is also very different from [DATE], because now we have plenty of capital, banks and insurance companies loaded with idle money; plenty of industrial productive capacity and [CARDINAL] of workers looking for jobs. It is following tradition as well as necessity, if Government strives to put idle money and idle men to work, to increase our public wealth and to build up the health and strength of the people and to help our system of private enterprise to function. It is going to cost Something to get out of this recession this way, but the profit of getting out of it will pay for the cost several times over. Lost working time is lost money. [DATE] that a workman is unemployed, or a machine is unused, or a business organization is marking time, is a loss to the [ORG]. Because of idle men and idle machines this [ORG] lost [MONEY] [DATE]. [DATE] you, the people of this country, are making [MONEY] less than [DATE]. If you think back to the experiences of [DATE] of this [ORG] you will remember the doubts and fears expressed about the rising expenses of Government. But to the surprise of the doubters, as we proceeded to carry on the program which included [ORG] and Work Relief, the country grew richer instead of poorer. It is worthwhile to remember that the [DATE] national people's income was [MONEY] more in [DATE] than in [DATE]. It is true that the national debt increased [MONEY], but remember that in this increase must be included [MONEY] worth of assets which eventually will reduce that debt and that [MONEY] of permanent public improvements schools, roads, bridges, tunnels, public buildings, parks and a host of other things meet your eye in every one of the [CARDINAL] counties in [GPE]. No doubt you will be told that the [ORG] spending program of [DATE] did not cause the increase in our national income. They will tell you that business revived because of private spending and investment. That is true in part, for the Government spent only a small part of the total. But Government spending acted as a trigger to set off private activity. That is why the total addition to our national production and national income has been so much greater than the contribution of the Government itself. In pursuance of that thought I said to the [ORG] [DATE]: I want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an adequate rise in national income merely by investing, lending or spending public funds. It is essential in our economy that private funds be put to work and all of us recognize that such funds are entitled to a fair profit. As national income rises, let us not forget that Government expenditures will go down and Government tax receipts will go up. The [ORG] contribution of land that we once made to business was the land of all the people. And the Government contribution of money which we now make to business ultimately comes out of the labor of all the people. It is, therefore, only sound morality, as well as a sound distribution of buying power, that the benefits of the prosperity coming from this use of the money of all the people should be distributed among all the people- at the bottom as well as at the top. Consequently I am again expressing my hope that the [ORG] will enact at this session a wage and hour bill putting a floor under industrial wages and a limit on [TIME] to ensure a better distribution of our prosperity, a better distribution of available work, and a sounder distribution of buying power. You may get all kinds of impressions in regard to the total cost of this new program, or in regard to the amount that will be added to the net national debt. It is a big program. [DATE] in a sincere effort to bring [ORG] expenditures and Government income into closer balance, the Budget I worked out called for sharp decreases in Government spending. In the light of present conditions those estimates were far too low. This new program adds [MONEY] to direct [ORG] expenditures and another [MONEY] to Government loans and the latter sum, because they are loans, will come back to the [ORG] in the future. The net effect on the debt of the [ORG] is this: [DATE] [DATE] away the [ORG] will have to raise [MONEY] of new money. Such an addition to the net debt of [GPE] need not give concern to any citizen, for it will return to the people of [GPE] many times over in increased buying power and eventually in much greater Government tax receipts because of the increase in the citizen income. What I said to the [ORG] in the close of my message I repeat to you. Let us unanimously recognize the fact that the Federal debt, whether it be [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], can only be paid if the [ORG] obtains a vastly increased citizen income. I repeat that if this citizen income can be raised to [MONEY] a year the national Government and the overwhelming majority of [ORG] and local governments will be 'out of the red.' The higher the national income goes the faster shall we be able to reduce the total of [ORG] and state and local debts. Viewed from every angle, [DATE]'s purchasing power the citizens' income of [DATE] is not sufficient to drive the economic system at higher speed. Responsibility of Government requires us at this time to supplement the normal processes and in so supplementing them to make sure that the addition is adequate. We must start again on a long steady upward incline in national income. . . . And in that process, which I believe is ready to start, let us avoid the pitfalls of the past the overproduction, the overspeculation, and indeed all the extremes which we did not succeed in avoiding in [DATE]. In all of this, Government cannot and should not act alone. Business must help. I am sure business will help. We need more than the materials of recovery. We need a united national will. We need to recognize nationally that the demands of no group, however just, can be satisfied unless that group is prepared to share in finding a way to produce the income from which it and all other groups can be paid. . . . You, as the [ORG], I, as the [INTERVIEWED], must, by virtue of our offices, seek the national good by preserving the balance between all groups and all sections. We have at our disposal the national resources, the money, the skill of hand and head to raise our economic level our citizens' income. Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work together. What is needed is the will. The time has come to bring that will into action with every driving force at our command. And I am determined to do my share. . . . Certain positive requirements seem to me to accompany the will- if we have that will. There is placed on all of us the duty of self-restraint. . . . That is the discipline of a democracy. Every patriotic citizen must say to himself or herself, that immoderate statement, appeals to prejudice, the creation of unkindness, are offenses not against an individual or individuals, but offenses against the whole population of [GPE]. . . . Self-restraint implies restraint by articulate public opinion, trained to distinguish fact from falsehood, trained to believe that bitterness is never a useful instrument in public affairs. There can be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this [ORG], save through division fostered by hate. Such division there must never be. Finally I should like to say a personal word to you. I never forget that I live in a house owned by all the [NORP] people and that I have been given their trust. I try always to remember that their deepest problems are human. I constantly talk with those who come to tell me their own points of view; with those who manage the great industries and financial institutions of the country; with those who represent the farmer and the worker; and often with average citizens without high position who come to this house. And constantly I seek to look beyond the doors of [ORG], beyond the officialdom of [GPE], into the hopes and fears of men and women in their homes. I have traveled the country over many times. My friends, my enemies, my [DATE] mail, bring to me reports of what you are thinking and hoping. I want to be sure that neither battles nor burdens of office shall ever blind me to an intimate knowledge of the way the [NORP] people want to live and the simple purposes for which they put me here. In these great problems of government I try not to forget that what really counts at the bottom of it all, is that the men and Women willing to work can have a decent job to take care of themselves and their homes and their children adequately; that the farmer, the factory worker, the storekeeper, the gas station man, the manufacturer, the merchant big and small the banker who takes pride in the help he gives to the building of his community, that all these can be sure of a reasonable profit and safety for the savings they earn not [DATE] nor [DATE] alone, but as far ahead as they can see. I can hear your unspoken wonder as to where we are headed in this troubled world. I cannot expect all of the people to understand all of the people's problems; but it is my job to try to understand those problems. I always try to remember that reconciling differences cannot satisfy everyone completely. Because I do not expect too much, I am not disappointed. But I know that I must never give up-that I must never let the greater interest of all the people down, merely because that might be for the moment the easiest personal way out. I believe we have been right in the course we have charted. To abandon our purpose of building a greater, a more stable and a more tolerant [GPE], would be to miss the tide and perhaps to miss the port. I propose to sail ahead. I feel sure that your hopes and your help are with me. For to reach a port, we must sail sail, not tie at anchor sail, not drift.", "discourse_type": 0}

Well, look, this is the most important, most sobering decision that you make as the in your role as Commander in Chief.

With respect to [GPE], I think that all of us believe that the situation has deteriorated somewhat there, and that is why I immediately made a decision for us to send additional troops, including marines from [FAC]. But I also think that we have got to refine our goals and our strategy more effectively. I think in [GPE] we have seen that strategy drift a little bit. And, you know, my most important job as Commander in Chief is to make sure that if we are sending folks there, we have a well-thought-out strategy, clear goals, and that they are achievable and that I can marshal and maintain the strongest support possible from folks back home. And to sort of continue with that topic, you said that the [GPE] will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for [GPE] and [GPE] to defeat [ORG] and to combat extremism in the region. What will this mean for our men and women in [GPE] now and in the future, sir? Well, first of all, by sending [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] troops, we are obviously going to be bolstering our forces in [GPE], and that will obviously be important to the folks that are already there. If you talk to General [PERSON], our commander in [GPE], he will tell you that especially in the southern regions of the country you have seen brazen attacks from [ORG] forces, extremist forces, and we want to make sure that we have the force necessary to meet that. I also think that because you are going to see that additional engagement, there is the risk of greater additional casualties, at least in the short term, just as there was in [GPE]. And, you know, that is something that, you know, we will have to monitor very carefully. The key, though, is to understand that we are not going to win in [GPE] or get an acceptable outcome in [GPE] if we are only dependent on our military. Our military does everything that is asked of them, but anybody who knows the region knows that if we do not have [ORG] that can deliver for its people, if we do not have an economic development strategy where farmers do not have to grown heroin poppy but instead can grow other crops so that they are not feeding narcoterrorism, if we do not have [GPE] providing us support on the other side of the border that cleans out some of these areas where [ORG] and the [ORG] are using as safe havens, then this is not going to work. And my goal is to have a comprehensive strategy of not just force, but also diplomacy and development that is all moving in concert to get the kind of outcome we want. Yes, sir. You just talked about your plan for drawing down combatant forces in [GPE] by [DATE]. Why is this timeline so important to you, sir? Well, because I think it is important, first of all, to send a very strong, clear signal to the [NORP] that they are going to need to be taking these responsibilities, that we mean it when we say that we are not going to be a permanent occupying force in [GPE]. And we already have an agreement, a security agreement that was signed by the previous administration and by the [PERSON] Government that says we have got to be out of there by [DATE]. We do not want to have [CARDINAL] 000 troops there [DATE] before we have to be out of there; we have got to have a glide path that is responsible in pulling our troops out. And so what we have done is we have set a point of [DATE], as a transition point, after the [NORP] elections have taken place, where there is , obviously, potential vulnerability. After that point, you are looking at maybe [CARDINAL] brigades, [CARDINAL], 000 troops overall, who are providing logistical support, training, are providing protection for [GPE] civilian as well as military personnel, and some counterterrorist counterterrorism striking capability. That then gets phased down over [DATE], until finally at [DATE], we should have no troops there. I think it is a responsible plan that meets our objectives, and it is one that was created in close consultation with our military commanders on the ground. Yes, sir. And in continuing on with that topic, what will be the major measuring stick, if you will, when we talk about the [CARDINAL], 000 troops? What is it that is going to really sway you in terms of, is it [CARDINAL][CARDINAL], is it [CARDINAL][CARDINAL], or is it [CARDINAL][CARDINAL]? Well, you know, I think that all these decisions have to be made based on what the situation is at the time, and it is very hard to anticipate exactly what things are going to be like in [DATE]. If we continue to make strong progress in training the [NORP] security forces, if the elections are peaceful, if we have seen resolution of some of the issues that are creating sectarian tension in [GPE], like the oil laws and how much power the national Government has versus the Provincial governments, if those issues are getting resolved peacefully through a regular political process, then that probably means that we are going to be able to have less troops support there, as of [DATE]. If some of those things have not happened, then that will put more of a burden on us, as well as the [NORP]. So our hope is, is that we are doing everything right leading up to that point so that by the time we get to that transition period, we are well prepared to start phasing our entire operation out of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED], how does your plan for [GPE] and [GPE] deal with the issue of relieving the pressure on the fighting force and their families? Well, this is one of the most important issues that we face. I do not need to tell you the enormous burden that our men and women in uniform have been under: so many people I meet on repeated tours [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] tours of duty; the stop-loss policy that is hit a number of our fighting men and women; the burden on military families, something that my wife, the First Lady, [PERSON], has taken very seriously and talked to a lot of families about. So first of all, obviously, as we start drawing down, that puts less pressure on military families. That means that we can start ending we can end stop-loss policy. We can start getting back to the kinds of rotations where, you know, after [DATE] of service, then people have a lot more time back home than they have had over [DATE], which is good for everybody. In addition, my budget has also called for an increase in the force structure, the size of the [ORG] and of the [ORG]. So that will also relieve some of the pressure, and it will allow us to meet some of the strategic needs not just in [GPE] and [GPE], but around the world. I mean, there is a big world out there, and right now we do not have the kind of strategic capability that we should to meet other emergency situations that might arise. Along those same lines, [CARDINAL] big piece of relief, I think you heard during the speech [DATE], is that we are going to have a pay increase for our troops. That, obviously, is important. But beyond that, in the recovery plan that I got passed through [ORG] we have a whole slew of steps that we are taking that are going to provide some immediate help to the military families. There is a lot of money in there for construction of wounded warrior treatment centers, construction of additional housing and facilities for military families. In my budget, we have got additional money for daycare, additional money for training, making sure that the GI bill that was signed [DATE] by [ORG], that that is adequately funded and implemented. So one of the things that is very important to me is improved quality of life, making sure that our troops and their families are supported, honored, and that our veterans, when they come home, are treated with the respect and the care that they need. Yes, sir. I have a final question for you, sir; I know you have a full plate [DATE]. If you could sit down and speak to each military member and their family, as Commander in Chief, what would you tell them, and how would you convey your commitment to them, sir? Well, first of all, what I'd tell them is thank you. And you know, [DATE], I had the mother and father of a fallen marine, who actually was stationed here at [FAC] I had written them a letter of gratitude and condolence. Their son had just been killed relatively recently. They actually got a ride on Air Force One down here because their grandchildren, their son's children, are still down here. And what I told them was, first of all, thank you; that all of [GPE] is grateful. We enjoy the freedoms we do because of what young men and women like that are willing to do on our behalf. And I wanted to tell them also that I carry them in my mind [DATE] when I am making decisions; that when I am thinking about troop deployments, when I am thinking about budgets, when I am thinking about what our foreign policy is going to be, uppermost in my mind is understanding that young men and women are willing to offer up their last full measure of devotion to this country. The least they can expect is, is that their [INTERVIEWED] is going to get it right and to keep them in mind when he is making the decision. Yes, sir. I really appreciate you joining us on [ORG], sir. I enjoyed it very much. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. You bet.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressaboutsecondannualforeignpolicyreportthecongress", "text": "Good [TIME], my fellow [NORP]: Over [DATE], Presidents of [GPE] have come before the [NORP] people in times of crisis to talk about war or the threat of war. [DATE] I am able to talk to you in a more hopeful and positive vein about how we are moving this Nation and the world toward a lasting peace. We have brought ourselves to a time of transition, from war toward peace, and this is a good time to gain some perspective on where we are and where we are headed. [DATE] I am sending to the [ORG] my second [DATE] comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affairs. It discusses not only what we have done but why we have done it, and how we intend to proceed in the future. I do not intend to summarize all that is in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time. Instead, I would like to focus on [CARDINAL] key points: How we are getting out of the war this Nation has been in for [DATE]; How we have created a new and different foreign policy approach for [GPE] in a greatly changed world; and How we are applying that approach in working with others to build a lasting peace. The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this [ORG] [DATE] was the war in [GPE]. We have come a long way since then. [DATE], when this [ORG] took office, there were [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] in [GPE]. Within [DATE] we will have brought home [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] men, and [DATE] I will announce a new schedule of withdrawals. [DATE], our casualties [DATE] were [CARDINAL] times as high as they are [DATE]. [DATE], the additional demands of the [GPE] war cost us [MONEY] per year. That cost has been cut in [CARDINAL]. Much of the progress in [GPE] was due to the success of the allied operations against the enemy sanctuaries in [GPE] [DATE]. The clear proof is in this figure: [NORP] casualties after [GPE] have been [CARDINAL] the rate they were before [GPE]. Our decision to clean out the sanctuaries in [GPE] saved [CARDINAL] of [NORP] lives. And it enabled us to continue withdrawing our men on schedule. Just as [DATE] cutoff of supplies through [GPE] has saved lives and insured our withdrawal program [DATE], the purpose of this [DATE]'s disruption of [FAC] in [GPE] is to save lives and insure the success of our withdrawal program [DATE]. The disruption of the [NORP] supply line through [GPE] is being accomplished by [NORP] troops, with no [GPE] ground troops or advisers. Their army is doing the fighting, with our air support, and the intensity of the fighting is evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy. Consider this combination of events that many people thought was impossible [DATE]: We have kept our commitments as we have taken out our troops. [GPE] now has an excellent opportunity not only to survive but to build a strong, free society. Thanks to the disruption of so much of the enemy's supplies, [NORP] are leaving [GPE] in safety; we would much prefer to leave [GPE] in peace. Negotiation remains the best and quickest way to end the war in a way that will not only end [GPE] involvement and casualties but will mean an end to the fighting between [NORP]. On [DATE], we made a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace. We proposed: an immediate standstill cease-fire throughout [GPE] to stop the fighting, an [GPE] peace conference, the withdrawal of all outside forces, a political settlement fair to both sides, the immediate release of all prisoners of war. I reaffirm that proposal [DATE]. It is supported by every government in [GPE] except [CARDINAL] [ORG]. I once again urge [GPE] to join us in this search for peace. If [GPE] wishes to negotiate with [GPE], they will have to recognize that time is running out. With the exception of the prisoners-of-war issue, if [GPE] continues to refuse to discuss our peace proposals, they will soon find they have no choice but to negotiate only with [NORP]. Our eventual goal is a total withdrawal of all outside forces. But as long as [GPE] continues to hold a single [NORP] prisoner, we shall have forces in [GPE]. The [NORP] prisoners of war will not be forgotten by their Government. I am keeping my pledge to end [GPE]'s involvement in this war. But the main point I want to discuss with you [DATE] and the main theme of my report to the [ORG] is the future, not the past. It matters very much how we end this war. To end a war is simple. But to end a war in a way that will not bring on another war is far from simple. In Southeast Asia [DATE], aggression is failing thanks to the determination of the [NORP] people and to the courage and sacrifice of [GPE]'s fighting men. That brings us to a point that we have been at several times before in [DATE]: aggression trained back, a war ending. We are at a critical moment in history: What [GPE] does or fails to do will determine whether peace and freedom can be won in [DATE]. That is why the way in which we end this conflict is so crucial to our efforts to build a lasting peace in [DATE]. The right way out of [GPE] is crucial to our changing role in the world and to peace in the world. To understand the nature of the new [NORP] role we must consider the great historical changes that have taken place. For [DATE] after World War II, [GPE] was not only the leader of the [NORP] world, it was the primary supporter and defender of this free world as well. But [DATE] our allies and friends have gained new strength and self-confidence. They are now able to participate much more fully not only in their own defense but in adding their moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order. [DATE] our adversaries no longer present a solidly united front; we can now differentiate in our dealings with them. [DATE] neither [GPE] nor [GPE] has a clear-cut nuclear advantage; the time is therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arms. The world has changed. Our foreign policy must change with it. We have learned in [DATE] the dangers of over-involvement. The other danger a grave risk we are equally determined to avoid is under-involvement. After a long and unpopular war, there is temptation to turn inward to withdraw from the world, to back away from our commitments. That deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism is surely the road to war. Our foreign policy [DATE] steers a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under-involvement. That policy, which I first enunciated in [GPE] [DATE], 1 represents our basic approach to the world: 1 See [DATE] volume, Item [CARDINAL]. We will maintain our commitments, but we will make sure our own troop levels or any financial support to other nations is appropriate to current threats and needs. We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. But we will look to threatened countries and their neighbors to assume primary responsibility for their own defense, and we will provide support where our interests call for that support and where it can make a difference. These principles are not limited to security matters. We shall pursue economic policies at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political ties between nations. As we actively seek to help other nations expand their economies, we can legitimately expect them to work with us in averting economic problems of our own. As we continue to send economic aid to developing nations, we will expect countries on the receiving end to mobilize their resources; we will look to other developed nations to do more in furnishing assistance; and we will channel our aid increasingly through groups of nations banded together for mutual support. This new sharing of responsibility requires not less [NORP] leadership than in the past, but rather a new, more subtle, form of leadership. No single nation can build a peace alone; peace can only be built by the willing hands and minds-of all. In the modern world, leadership cannot be do-it-yourself the path of leadership is in providing the help, the motive, the inspiration to do it together. In carrying out what is referred to as the Nixon Doctrine, we recognize that we cannot transfer burdens too swiftly. We must strike a balance between doing too much and preventing self-reliance, and suddenly doing too little and undermining self-confidence. We intend to give our friends the time and the means to adjust, materially and psychologically, to a new form of [NORP] participation in the world. How have we applied our new foreign policy during [DATE]? And what is our future agenda as we work with others to build a stable world order? In Western Europe, we have shifted from predominance to partnership with our allies. Our ties with Western Europe are central to the structure of peace because its nations are rich in tradition and experience, strong economically, vigorous in diplomacy and culture; they are in a position to take a major part in building a world of peace. Our ties were strengthened on my second trip to Europe [DATE] and reflected in our close consultation on arms control negotiations. At our suggestion, the [ORG] alliance made a thorough review of its military strategy and posture. As a result, we have reached new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly. In Eastern Europe, our exchange of state visits with [GPE] and my meeting [DATE] with Marshal [PERSON] in [GPE] are examples of our search for wider reconciliation with the nations that used to be considered behind [FAC]. Looking ahead in Europe: We shall cooperate in our political and economic relations across the Atlantic as the Common Market grows. We and our allies will make the improvements necessary to carry out our common defense strategy. Together we stand ready to reduce forces in Western Europe in exchange for mutual reductions in Eastern Europe. The problems of Africa are great, but so is her potential. [GPE] will support her peoples' efforts to build a continent that provides social justice and economic expansion. Turning to our own hemisphere: In Latin America, there was too much tendency in the past to take our closest friends and neighbors for granted. Recently, we have paid new respect to their proud traditions. Our trade, credit, and economic policies have been reexamined and reformed to respond to their concerns and their ideas, as well as to our own interests. Our new [NORP] policy is designed to help them help themselves; our new attitude will not only aid their progress but add to their dignity. Great changes are brewing throughout the [NORP] hemisphere. We can have no greater goal than to help provide the means for necessary change to be accomplished in peace and for all change to be in the direction of greater self-reliance. Turning to the Far East: a new Asia is emerging. The old enmities of World War II are dead or dying. [NORP] states are stronger and are joining together in vigorous regional groupings. Here the doctrine that took shape [DATE] is taking hold [DATE], helping to spur self-reliance and cooperation between states. In [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and the [GPE], we have consolidated bases and reduced [NORP] forces. We have relaxed trade and travel restrictions to underline our readiness for greater contact with [NORP] [GPE]. Looking ahead in that area: While continuing to help our friends help themselves, we must begin to consider how regional associations can work together with the major powers in the area for a durable peace. We will work to build a strong partnership with [GPE] that will accommodate our mutual interests. We will search for consecutive discussions with [NORP] [GPE] while maintaining our defense commitment to [GPE]. When [ORG] is ready to engage in talks, it will find us receptive to agreements that further the legitimate national interests of [GPE] and its neighbors. In Asia, we can see [DATE]'s world in microcosm. An economically powerful democratic free nation, [GPE], is seeking new markets; a potentially powerful [NORP] nation, [GPE], will [DATE] seek new outlets and new relations; a [NORP] competitor, [GPE], has interests there as well; and the independent [NORP] nations of Southeast Asia are already working together in regional association. These great forces are bound to interact in the not too distant future. In the way they work together and in the way we cooperate with their relationship is the key to permanent peace in that area the Far East, the scene of such a painful legacy of the recent past, can become an example of peace and stability in the future. In the Middle East, [GPE] took the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace. Along [FAC] [DATE], there was [DATE] combat on the ground and in the air. Diplomacy was at an impasse. The danger of local conflict was magnified by growing [NORP] involvement and the possibility of great powers being drawn into confrontation. [GPE] took the lead in arranging a cease-fire and getting negotiations started. We are seeing to it that the balance of power, so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting, is not upset. Working behind the scenes, when a crisis arose in [GPE], [GPE] played a key role in seeing that order was restored and an invasion was abandoned. We recognize that [DATE] of suspicion and [DATE] of hostility cannot be ended [TIME]. There are great obstacles in the way of a permanent, peaceful settlement, and painful compromise is required by all concerned. We are encouraged by the willingness of each of the parties to begin to look to the larger interest of peace and stability throughout the Middle East. There is still the risk of war, but now for the first time in [DATE] the parties are actively calculating the risks of peace. The policy of [GPE] will continue to be to promote peace talks-not to try to impose a peace from the outside, but to support the peace efforts of the parties in the region themselves. [CARDINAL] way to support these efforts is for [GPE] to discourage any outside power from trying to exploit the situation for its own advantage. Another way for us to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement is this: [GPE] is fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keeping the peace arrived at through negotiation between the parties. We know what our vital interests are in the Middle East. Those interests include friendly and constructive relations with all nations in the area. Other nations know that we are ready to protect those vital interests. And [CARDINAL] good reason why other nations take us at our word in the Middle East is because [GPE] has kept its word in Southeast Asia. We now come to a matter that affects every nation: the relations between the world's [CARDINAL] great super powers. Over [DATE], in some fields [GPE] and [GPE] have moved ahead together. We have taken the first step toward cooperation in outer space. We have both ratified the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. [DATE], we signed a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons from the seabeds. These are hopeful signs, but certain other [NORP] actions are reason for concern. There is need for much more cooperation in reducing tensions in the Middle East and in ending harassment of [GPE]. We must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenges in sensitive areas such as the Caribbean. In the long run, the most significant result of negotiations between the super powers in the past year could be in the field of arms control. The strategic arms limitation talks with [GPE] have produced the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conducted between our [CARDINAL] nations. Each side has had the chance to explain at length the concerns caused by the posture of the other side. The talks have been conducted in a serious way without the old lapses into propaganda. If both sides continue in this way, there is reason to hope that specific agreements will be reached to curb the arms race. Taking a first step in limiting the capacity of mankind to destroy itself would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world; it would add to the security of both [GPE] and [GPE], and it would add to the world's peace of mind. In all our relations with the [NORP], we shall make the most progress by recognizing that in many cases our national interests are not the same. It serves no purpose to pretend they are; our differences are not matters of mood, they are matters of substance. But in many other cases, our separate national interests can best be pursued by a sober consideration of the world interest. [GPE] will deal, as it must, from strength: We will not reduce our defenses below the level I consider essential to our national security. A strong [GPE] is essential to the cause of peace [DATE]. Until we have the kind of agreements we can rely on, we shall remain strong. But [GPE]'s power will always be used for building a peace, never for breaking it only for defending freedom, never for destroying it. [GPE]'s strength will be, as it must be, second to none; but the strength that this Nation is proudest of is the strength of our determination to create a peaceful world. We all know how every town or city develops a sense of community when its citizens come together to meet a common need. The common needs of the world [DATE], about which there can be no disagreement or conflict of national interest, are plain to see. We know that we must act as one world in restoring the world's environment, before pollution of the seas and skies overwhelms every nation. We know we must stop the flow of narcotics; we must counter the outbreaks of hijacking and kidnaping; we must share the great discoveries about the oceans and outer space. [GPE] is justly proud of the lead it has taken in working within [ORG], and within the [ORG] alliance, to come to grips with these problems and with these opportunities. Our work here is a beginning, not only in coping with the new challenges of technology and modern life but of developing a worldwide sense of community that will ease tension, reduce suspicion, and thereby promote the process of peace. That process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect. We can have that mutual respect with our friends, without dominating them or without letting them down. We can have that mutual respect with our adversaries, without compromising our principles or weakening our resolve. And we can have that mutual respect among ourselves, without stifling dissent or losing our capacity for action. Our goal is something [NORP] have not enjoyed in [DATE]: a full generation of peace. A full generation of peace depends not only on the policy of [CARDINAL] party or of [CARDINAL] nation or [CARDINAL] alliance or [CARDINAL] bloc of nations. Peace for the next generation depends on our ability to make certain that each nation has a share in its shaping, and that every nation has a stake in its lasting. This is the hard way, requiring patience, restraint, understanding, and when necessary-bold, decisive action. But history has taught us that the old diplomacy of imposing a peace by the fiat of great powers simply does not work. I believe that the new diplomacy of partnership, of mutual respect, of dealing with strength and determination will work. I believe that the right degree of [NORP] involvement not too much and not too little will evoke the right response from our other partners on this globe in building for our children the kind of world they deserve: a world of opportunity in a world without war.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfreeandfairtrade", "text": "My fellow [NORP]: In my last radio address, I discussed my decision not to impose quotas or tariffs on footwear imports. Protectionism, I said, costs consumers [MONEY], damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing [NORP] out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create [NORP] jobs by increasing exports. I instructed [ORG] to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful. Therefore, I am directing [ORG] to start proceedings in [CARDINAL] cases of unfair trade: [CARDINAL], against a [NORP] law that prohibits fair competition of [GPE] life and fire insurance firms in the [NORP] market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; [CARDINAL], against a [NORP] law that has restricted [GPE] exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some [NORP] computer firms operating there; and [CARDINAL], against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in [GPE] that unfairly block [GPE] entry into that market. I have also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up [NORP] markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge [ORG] subsidies on canned fruit. On these [CARDINAL] cases we are setting a deadline of [DATE]. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then. We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to [NORP] exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I am committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. [NORP] exporters and [NORP] workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all. There are no winners in a trade war, only losers. As we take these important steps to make our trading system freer and fairer, let us also look at the subject of trade in its broader context. Some point to our trade deficit with alarm, but our share of world exports has not declined. In [DATE] our share of world exports was just below [PERCENT]; in [DATE] it was [PERCENT]. We have a trade deficit not because exports are declining but because imports are rising at a much more rapid pace. Why? Because our economy is, in a sense, out of balance with many of our trading partners. The strong growth of the [GPE] economy has simply not been matched by many countries abroad. Our tax cuts ignited a noninflationary economic expansion that has put [CARDINAL] [NORP] to work in the last 33 months alone. In fact, numbers released [DATE] showed a dramatic drop in overall unemployment to [PERCENT], the lowest in [DATE]. Contrast that to Europe where a mix of protectionist policies and continued high tax rates have produced economic anemia and where they have actually lost jobs overall in [DATE]. And many developing countries with massive debts, high taxes, and low or negative growth find it difficult to afford [GPE] exports; some look to our strong dollar as the culprit. And, yes, a strong dollar does make it harder for [NORP] firms to sell their products abroad, but the strong dollar is a reflection of [GPE]'s economic strength. Low taxes and low inflation make [GPE] an attractive place to invest. We can either balance the trade deficit up by encouraging our trading partners to adopt the high-growth policies of tax cuts and open markets, or we can balance down by adopting the no growth policies of tax hikes and protectionism. The choice is clear. Let us take the high road to prosperity by fighting for an open, free, and fair trading system with our economic partners and by encouraging them to adopt low tax, high employment growth policies. And let us keep our engines of growth humming here at home, too, by passing a new tax plan for [GPE], a fair share tax plan for all. Until [DATE], thanks for listening. God bless you all.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfromelkonevada", "text": "AboutSearch My fellow citizens: We have been through an arduous campaign. It has been almost unique as a campaign of education in the great domestic and international problems which have arisen out of events of [DATE]. I have endeavored to place these problems before the people as I see them from the facts and experience that have come to me in [DATE]. I wished the people to realize more intimately the difficulties with which their Government has been confronted, the disasters which have been averted, and the forces which have been mobilized for their support and their protection. I hope from these discussions that the people will realize the great crisis that we have successfully passed and the unprecedented measures taken which have been designed solely that we might protect and restore the system of life and of government endeared to us over [DATE]--a government that has given to us protection from distress and allayed the forces which would otherwise have wrecked our homes and our firesides. But more than that, I hope I have given an understanding of these measures that have been designed for counterattack upon this crisis. These measures are now demonstrating their strength and effectiveness not only at home but abroad, evidences of which are multiplying throughout the country in the return of [CARDINAL] men to work [DATE], and that we have again resumed the road toward prosperity. I might add that the figure which I have given during [DATE] of the return of [CARDINAL] men to work since the adjournment of the [ORG] have been added to during [DATE] [DATE] by the estimates of [ORG] which increased the estimates, which I have given to you, by [CARDINAL], 000 men. I wish to emphasize the greatest function of the [NORP] citizen, the one which each of us should perform [DATE]. The ballot is that most sacred individual act which preserves the great system of self-government which we have inherited and which should carry forward at any cost. It is a direct opportunity for every man and woman to express their views in terms of equality with every other citizen as to the policies and kind of a government that they wish carried out in [DATE]. And I have a deep feeling that the choice that you make now is more than the choice for [DATE]. There is great divergence in the philosophy of government between the parties which may affect events over [DATE]; a mistaken choice may hazard the welfare of our children and our children's children. I have been fighting that the wrong course may not be adopted, not by appeal to destructive emotion, but by truth and logic. I have tried to dissolve the mirage of promises by the reality of facts. I am a believer in party government. It is only through party organization that our people can give coherent expression to their views upon public issues. There is no other way except by revolution, but we in [GPE] have ordained that the ballot shall be used for peaceful determination and not violence. We are a nation of progressives. We wish to see our Nation march forward. We differ strongly as to the method to progress. I differ widely with the principles and views advocated by our opponents, but it is not my purpose to review them at this moment. I feel deeply that [ORG] has been the party of progress in our history from [DATE] of [PERSON]. It has built the progress of the [ORG] upon the foundations of national principles and national ideals. We are a nation of homes from which the accomplishment of individuals is nurtured by the maximum freedom in an ordered liberty. The ultimate goal of our progress is to build for security and happiness in these homes where the inspiration of our religious faiths will implant in our children those principles of social order and idealism, and where our Government will contribute in safeguarding their future opportunity for them. The action of our Nation has been modified and benefited by the enfranchisement of women. They equally with the men bear the shocks from economic disaster. With them lies largely the guardianship of the fundamental ideals, because concentrated in their lives and their responsibilities is a solicitude for the preservation of the home and the inspiration for the future. And in these labors our Government can contribute to strengthen their accomplishment and their influence. Our women give with lavish hands, not only to childhood, but, as well, to the creation of those conserving customs upon which are builded all the blessings of our ordered Government. They thus give to government a large measure of the true strength of its foundations. It is but just that they receive back, in return, all that the Government can give them to assure them of security and the enlargement of the equal opportunity to their children and to themselves, to widen the field for the use of their own powers of mind and spirit. It is they who are mobilizing new public regard to our obligations to home and children of the future; it is they who are mobilizing the public opinion on the maintenance of peace in the world. The men of our country carry the frontline of battle through their initiative, their enterprise, their hopes, their courage. The immediate question before our country is in whose direction shall be the measures by which we shall emerge from our present difficulties. In the longer view our problems are the questions that the world should have peace; that the prosperity of the Nation shall be diffused to all, and that we shall build more strongly the ideal of equal opportunity amongst all our people; that we shall secure that obedience to law which is essential to assurance of life in our institutions; that honesty and righteousness in business shall confirm the confidence of our people in our institutions and laws; that our Government shall contribute to leadership in these matters. It is my deep conviction that for the welfare of [GPE] [ORG] should continue to administer the Government. Those men and women who have supported the party over [DATE] should not be led astray by false gods arrayed in the rainbow colors of promises. They have but to review the performance and the sense of responsibility, the constructive action, the maintenance of national ideals by [ORG], in every national crisis including the present, always in opposition to the destructive forces of sectional and group action of our opponents. [DATE] is more than a day set aside for casting of our several ballots. There is a solemnity in the feeling of [DATE], the sense of being in the presence of a great invisible power when the united people of a great nation give their final judgment on great issues. We cannot feel that any human power alone can give us such emotions; rather we must trust that we are sensing the movements of that Ruler of the universe in whose beneficence and in whose favor we have been blessed throughout our history. As a final word, I wish to convey my deep gratitude to [CARDINAL] of people who have come to stations and to meetings to welcome and encourage me during [DATE] and to [CARDINAL] more who have responded to me over the radio. I wish to express my gratitude to the young men and the young women who have organized their special movement to my support, for in them lies a special energy and idealism which drives and inspires the country; to the veterans' service leagues whose tested patriotism has supported me in this campaign; to the devoted women who, realizing the results at stake, have worked untiringly for the return of this administration; and to the organizations of men throughout the country who have been unceasing through this campaign in their presentation to the [NORP] people of the principles and ideals for which I have stood.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationtheamericanfamily", "text": "AboutSearch My fellow [NORP]: This is a very special time of year for us, a time for family reunions and for celebrating together the blessings of God and the promises He has given us. From [DATE] to Hanukkah, which our [NORP] community is now celebrating, to [DATE] in [DATE], this is a season of hope and of love. Certainly one of the greatest blessings for people everywhere is the family itself. [ORG] recently dedicated its book of essays, The Family in the Modern World, to [PERSON], daughter of [PERSON] and [PERSON], to whose christening came [CARDINAL] [NORP] expressing their belief that the family remains the foundation of freedom. And, of course, they are right. It is in the family where we learn to think for ourselves, care for others, and acquire the values of self-reliance, integrity, responsibility, and compassion. Families stand at the center of society, so building our future must begin by preserving family values. Tragically, too many in [GPE] has been asking us to swallow a whopper: namely, that bigger government is the greatest force for fairness and progress. But this so-called solution has given most of us a bad case of financial indigestion. How can families survive when big government's powers to tax, inflate, and regulate absorb their wealth, usurp their rights, and crush their spirit? Was there compassion for a working family in [PERCENT] interest rates, [PERCENT] inflation, and taxes soaring out of sight? Consider the cost of childrearing. It now takes $[MONEY], 000 to raise a child to [DATE], and family incomes have not kept up. During [DATE] real wages actually declined [PERCENT]. Consider taxes. In [DATE] the tax on the average [CARDINAL]-child family was [MONEY]. [DATE] it is $[MONEY], [MONEY]. As economic and social pressures have increased, the bonds that bind families together have come under strain. For example, [CARDINAL] times as many families are headed by single parents [DATE] as in [DATE]. Many single parents make heroic sacrifices and deserve all our support. But there is no question that many well-intentioned [ORG]-type programs contributed to family breakups, welfare dependency, and a large increase in births out of wedlock. In [DATE] the number of single mothers rose from [PERCENT] [PERCENT] among whites and from [CARDINAL] to a tragic [PERCENT] among blacks. Too often their children grow up poor, malnourished, and lacking in motivation. It is a path to social and health problems, low school performance, unemployment, and delinquency. If we strengthen families, we will help reduce poverty and the whole range of other social problems. We can begin by reducing the economic burdens of inflation and taxes, and we are doing this. Since [DATE] inflation has been chopped by [CARDINAL]. Taxes have been cut for every family that earns a living, and we have increased the tax credit for child care. [DATE] we learned that our growing economy reduced unemployment to [PERCENT] [DATE]. The payroll employment figure went up by [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs. At the same time, new policies are helping our neediest families move from dependence to independence. Our new job training law will train [CARDINAL] needy and unemployed [NORP] [DATE] for productive jobs. [SPEAKER]should add that our enterprise zones proposal would stimulate new businesses, bringing jobs and hope to some of the most destitute areas of the country. The [ORG] has adopted this proposal. But after [DATE] of delay, the [ORG] [NORP] leadership only recently agreed to hold its first hearing on the legislation. This is a jobs bill [GPE] needs. And come [DATE], we expect action. We are moving forward on many other fronts. We have made prevention of drug abuse among youth a top priority. We will soon announce a national missing children's center to help find and rescue children who've been abducted and exploited. We are working with States and local communities to increase the adoption of special-needs children. More children with permanent homes mean fewer children with permanent problems. We are also stiffening the enforcement of child support from absent parents. And we are trying hard to improve education through more discipline, a return to the basics, and through reforms like tuition tax credits to help hard-working parents. In [DATE], we will propose new ways to help families stay together, remain independent, and cope with the pressures of modern life. A cornerstone of our efforts must be assisting families to support themselves. As [PERSON] said [DATE], Self-help and self-control are the essence of the [NORP] tradition. In [GPE] everyone looks out for special interest groups. Well, i think families are pretty special. And with your help, we will continue looking out for their interests. Till [DATE], thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationunitedstatesassistanceforthenicaraguandemocratic2", "text": "AboutSearch My fellow [NORP]: We are about to mark an important anniversary, but it'll be no cause for celebration. [DATE], the [NORP] [NORP] came to power in the [NORP] country of [GPE]. It may be hard to remember now, the great hopes with which their revolution was first greeted. The hated dictator [PERSON] had been toppled, and the world looked forward to a bright future for [GPE]. Little did we think then that the future the [NORP] were planning for [GPE] would be darker than anything that suffering country had ever before experienced. The [NORP] spelled out their plans for subversion and aggression throughout Central America in the secret, but now notorious, [TIME] Document, and it was not long before they started carrying them out. Arms shipments began flowing to the [NORP] guerrillas throughout Latin America-in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and other countries. Within [GPE], the [NORP] quickly built up the apparatus of a police state: closing churches and extinguishing the free press. The ranks of political prisoners swelled into [CARDINAL], and beatings, torture, and official murder became the order of [DATE]. Meanwhile, the [NORP] began a campaign of slaughter against the peaceful [NORP]. [CARDINAL] in every [CARDINAL] [NORP] is now a refugee-leaving home, family, and friends to escape the oppression inside that country. If the [NORP] get their way, the torment of that sad country will soon spread throughout the entire region, engulfing the young democracies that surround [GPE]. As I said in [GPE] [DATE], the democratic aspirations of [CARDINAL] in Central America now hang in the balance. The elected leaders of neighboring [NORP] countries know that until democracy comes to [GPE] their own democracies will never be safe. And that is why, along with us, they have insisted on one thing: free, fair, and regularly scheduled elections in [GPE], the establishment of a genuinely democratic system and all the freedoms such a system depends on and encourages-freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of worship. This is what the [NORP] freedom fighters are fighting for, and this is why we must support them. We have worked in many ways to counter the spread of communism in Central America and those nations I have mentioned that are threatened by [GPE]. We have instituted economic assistance to the region, military assistance to threatened democracies, and, together with our [NORP] allies, vigorous efforts to negotiate a peaceful and democratic outcome. But we know from experience that the [NORP] will never negotiate seriously unless they see that the freedom fighters are a force to be reckoned with. Without the freedom fighters backing them up, negotiations can amount to no more than a hoax. Believe me, the current efforts of the [NORP] democracies to seek a peaceful and democratic outcome will not succeed if the [NORP] think that all they have to do is wait [DATE] and see if this country still has the resolve to support those who seek freedom in [GPE]. The [NORP] have spent [MONEY] to prop up the [NORP] regime and to defeat the freedom fighters. The [NORP] know what is at stake in [GPE], and they know that the freedom fighters are all that stand between them and domination of the entire region. Now, some tell me that the people in this country just do not care about the freedom fighters, but I do not think that is true. The more people know about the [NORP] [NORP], the more they support the freedom fighters. That is why the closer you get to [GPE], the stronger their support grows. Public opinion polls in [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] show overwhelming support for contra aid. In [GPE] [PERCENT] of the people support it. Of course, inside [GPE] they do not have any polls, but the people there are [DATE] risking their lives, giving whatever help they can to see the young men and boys who are fighting for their country's freedom. In this country, too, we have seen support grow dramatically as the [NORP] people learn the facts about [GPE]. The [NORP] people are tired of the off-on-again policy in Central America. A bipartisan majority supported aid to the freedom fighters [DATE]. The [NORP] people want that aid to continue. And that is why we have got to get the message out. Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors-even your Congressmen and Senators. Let them know how you feel. We have got to get the message out, because there is no question in my mind, when the [NORP] people have the facts, they will support freedom this time and every time. Until [DATE], thanks for listening, and God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}

Thank you very much, Secretary [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Captain [PERSON], and to all of you who are here. It is a great honor for me to be here. I asked to see the person responsible for decorating the F-14 with my name and the Vice President's name there. I guess I am going to have to take flying lessons. Audience member. He is right here, Mr. [SPEAKER], Skipper [PERSON]. Comdr. [PERSON]. [PERSON], sir. [SPEAKER]. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I told someone to take a picture of that, and I am going to take it back to the Vice President when I see him [TIME] and suggest that we both take flying lessons. Admiral [PERSON] said, You understand on that plane, you would still control the eject seat. And I told him, I do not believe in ejecting. I'd never bail out. But I was glad to know that. I thank you all for your service. I am pleased and honored to be with you [DATE]. I understand that some of you have actually chosen to come back from your leave to be a part of this ceremony, and I am deeply grateful for yet another expression of your devotion to your country. I am proud of the job you have done, proud of the great work that all of our troops are doing in [GPE]. And on behalf of the [NORP] people, the most important message I have to you [DATE] is a simple, straightforward, heartfelt thank you. I also want to thank, especially, Captain [PERSON] and the crew of this magnificent carrier for the I Like Ike button. You know, you may think that is funny, since he was a [NORP] and I am a [NORP], but when I was born, [SPEAKER] [PERSON] was President. But obviously, I was an infant; I did not have much consciousness of it. President [PERSON] was elected in [DATE] I went to the first grade, so he was the first President I really ever knew anything about. And all of us, regardless of our party, liked [PERSON]. I can still remember when the country was united in a way that it is not now and when political arguments were a little more civil than they tend to be now. President [PERSON]'s life of service to our country and his incredible leadership throughout his military career, culminating in his leadership in World War II and of course ultimately in his election to the Presidency, was an inspiration to me and to every other young [NORP] and I know is a continuing inspiration to all of you who are privileged to serve on this great carrier and in this group. Much has been asked of you, and you have delivered. Thanks to your efforts, the [NORP] people are moving from fear to freedom. Thanks to your efforts, the democratically elected government will soon return to power. Thanks to your efforts, the world knows that [GPE] will stand up for human rights and against slaughter, stand up for democracy, honor our commitments, and expect those who make commitments to us to honor them as well. We gave our word, and you, the men and women of [ORG], kept the word of [GPE]. And for that, we are all in your debt. The stories from [GPE] and elsewhere in [GPE] have inspired all [NORP]. We have seen the moving images of [NORP] approaching and thanking [NORP] troops for their new-found freedom. We have seen the joy in their eyes and the hope in their faces. Operation Uphold Democracy is not over yet, and you know well that it still presents dangers to the men and women of our [ORG]. But look what has happened in [DATE]. In [DATE], you have disarmed [ORG], the attaches, and the other militia who terrorized [CARDINAL] of [NORP]. In [DATE], you took heavy weapons away from the military and made the cities and the towns more secure. In [DATE], you helped [CARDINAL] refugees return home from [FAC], no longer afraid for their lives. In [DATE], you permitted [ORG] once again to open its doors for business. And [DATE], they are having a good, old-fashioned debate down there, about like what happens in [ORG] [DATE] in [GPE]. In [DATE], you returned [GPE] Mayor [PERSON], a man in hiding in his own country for [DATE], back to his office. In [DATE], you put state radio and television back into the hands of people who want democracy. In [DATE], you even turned the lights back on in [GPE] after [DATE] of darkness. In [DATE], you showed the world what the men and women of the [NORP] military can do. All of us owe these achievements to the fact that you are the best trained, best prepared, best equipped, most highly motivated fighting force in the world. Your reputation preceded you to [GPE]. When the military rulers learned that you were on your way, they agreed to step down. The awesome force you represent is the steel in the sword of [GPE]'s diplomacy. The success of the mission in [GPE] to date also shows how flexible our military has become. Thanks to careful planning by [ORG] and the joint task force, we were able to quickly recall the massive assault force that was on its way. In its place, and within [TIME] of reaching agreement with Mr. [PERSON] and the other military leaders, we sent in troops, carried by [ORG], to keep the peace in [GPE]. Operation Uphold Democracy demonstrates the value of mixing our [CARDINAL] services together and drawing on the special capabilities of each of them, what Admiral [PERSON] calls adaptive force packaging. You prepared the first-ever infantry air assault from a carrier. Had it not been for such innovation, it would have taken [TIME] hours, if not [DATE], for our troops to be on the ground there. I salute Admiral [PERSON] and the members of his staff who developed this innovative plan, which will change our military planning and make it possible for us to do remarkable things well into [DATE]. You have laid the groundwork for a dramatic forward movement in a military planning and execution. You should be proud, and the [ORG] owes Admiral [PERSON] and his staff a great deal. Of course, even the best strategists can only make a difference if they have the resources to do the job. That is why I was pleased [DATE] to sign the [DATE] defense authorization bill, which was passed with strong bipartisan support including the support of [GPE]'s [CARDINAL] fine Senators, [PERSON] and [PERSON], and the [CARDINAL] able Congressmen from this area, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. This bill will assure that you remain better trained, better equipped, and better prepared than any other military in the world, and I am determined that it will always be that way. [Applause] Thank you. I know that [CARDINAL] piece of this defense bill will be especially welcome news for all of you, the [MONEY] we will spend on a new aircraft carrier, CVN-76. That carrier will be built right here in [GPE] by [CARDINAL] of hard-working [NORP]. Like the [PERSON], it will give us the capability to project our power around the world, to support peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions, and, if necessary, to fight and to win regional conflicts. In [DATE], [DATE], you set sail for the Adriatic, to carry on your work of protecting our country's national interests around the world. I know you will demonstrate the same skill and professionalism on this journey that you have shown in [GPE]. In [TIME], I will have the distinct honor of presenting [ORG] commendation medals for meritorious service in [GPE] to several of you. But I want every one of you to know that in my book, each and every one of you is a medal winner, an example of what is the very best in our country. You serve with distinction, you serve in a selfless way, you serve in a way that will help us to build a peaceful and freer and stronger world for yourselves and your children as we move into [DATE], and we are all in your debt. Men and women of the Ike, you have proved your capabilities time and again. In [GPE], you brought a new day to a people who thought they would never get it. You answered the call; you did the job; your country is proud of you. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksadministrationsupporterschildpornographyandthesupremecourtnomination", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you all very much, and welcome to the [FAC] complex. [FAC] complex-that is what they call these buildings. Makes you wonder, cannot anything in [GPE] ever be simple? [Laughter] Seeing all of you here [DATE] is a particular pleasure for me, because together you speak for some of the causes that are closest to my heart, some of the most important reasons our administration came to [GPE] in the first place. Some of you are law enforcement officers. Some are civilians who work for victims' rights. Some are fighting obscenity and the unspeakable evil of child pornography. Others are working to prevent drug abuse. In [DATE], I have heard a lot of talk-much of it, to put it most kindly, inaccurate-about our social agenda, particularly as it applies to the courts. Well, if anyone wants to know our true agenda, there is no need to go any farther than this room, because your agenda is our agenda. I do not need to tell anyone here the sad, often tragic story of [DATE] of judicial solicitation for every conceivable right of criminals and neglect for the victims of crime, of playing fast and loose with first amendment rights in a way that gave too many pornographers free rein, of fanciful constitutional arguments used to throw out long and hard police work, and of the price our nation has paid for all of this. [CARDINAL] way, for example, that we have paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography. The sale of pornography was once said to be victimless. But common sense should have told us all along that pornography has many victims-among them, children. I read a statistic recently that, in [DATE], [CARDINAL] dial-a-porn company has received [CARDINAL] 000 calls. I am told that the great proportion of those calls are thought to have been made by children. There is nothing victimless about those children. The time has come for this to stop. Let me mention here-and I have recently sent [ORG] a bill that will make it easier for law enforcement officials to fight obscenity and child pornography. But incredible as it may seem, there are well-meaning people who will oppose it. The most extreme say that the first amendment protects child pornographers as they publish and distribute their products. However well-intended, that kind of extremism should not be allowed to prevail. It is not what the Constitution requires. I hope I can count on your support in getting this bill enacted into law. [Applause] I should have known you'd feel that way. [Laughter] By the way, we could also use a boost with our criminal justice reform legislation. I hope I can count on your support on something else as well, and it is the principal reason that we are here [DATE]. I have nominated a judge to [ORG] who is realistic about pornography and crime in general: Judge [PERSON]. Judge [PERSON] has been on my short list from the very start. A graduate of [ORG] and [ORG], he has served [DATE] on [ORG]. There he won the respect of his fellow jurists and the lawyers who practice before that court. He participated in [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] decisions and wrote [CARDINAL] opinions. He earned the reputation for being a balanced and fair judge and one who is tough on crime and concerned about the victims of crime. As he said [DATE]: Victims' dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system represents a failure of the system to achieve its goals. And then he added: The significant criminal law decisions of [ORG] focused on the relation of the accused to the state, and the police as an instrument of the state. Little or no thought was given to the position of the victims. Well, that is a note of compassion and realism that is too often missing in our courts. Realism runs through all his work on the bench. He argued in [CARDINAL] dissent, for example, for a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, and saw his position ultimately adopted by [ORG]. That was in a drug case, by the way. And for realism about police work, the opinion he wrote in that case sets a high standard. He said, and I will quote again: You do not have to read many cases involving illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly what was going on at the residences described by the officer's affidavit. And he concluded: Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become compounded unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when the only commonsense explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity. Another example of his realism-[DATE] Judge [PERSON] upheld a lower court when it imposed the maximum sentence allowed by law against a child pornographer. His opinion focused on the severe psychological harm victims of child pornography endure and the great likelihood that child pornographers will, when released, commit the same crimes again. We need more realism like that on the [ORG]'s highest court. We need Judge [PERSON] on our highest court. But let me add another thought here. Being tough on crime does not require tortured constitutional reasoning. The Constitution itself is tough on crime; it was intended to establish justice and ensure domestic tranquility. It provides a system for discovering the truth, releasing the innocent, and punishing the guilty, not for subjecting the police to an endless guessing game about the rules. Not long ago, I heard about a case that involved a particularly horrible murder and that illustrates just what is too often wrong in our courts. A man threw his girlfriend's [DATE] child down the trash chute of her ll-story apartment building. He was arrested, tried, and convicted. But the conviction was thrown out on appeal. Citing heavily from [ORG] rulings, the [ORG] appeals court decided that the man had been denied equal justice under the law, because he was not taken before a court commissioner within [TIME] of arrest. No, he was taken [TIME] and [TIME] after arrest. So, he is out walking the streets now. We have had enough decisions like that. [ORG] sets the tone for all courts in our land, as well as establishing precedence in the Federal judiciary. I hope we will have your active support as the [ORG] deliberates on confirming Judge [PERSON] to [ORG]. And now, I know you have heard a number of people, and you have heard enough from me. So, thank you, and God bless you all.", "discourse_type": 0}

All you kids, welcome to [FAC] of [FAC]. And to the Vice President and Mrs. [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON], a warm welcome. A particularly warm welcome to the Members of [ORG], both [ORG] and [ORG], that are with us [DATE]. Welcome to all of you, our very special guests, on this special occasion. I have just come from a working session in [ORG], working with some of the great experts on school choice. The parents, I think, made the most significant contribution to our working session because their dreams for their kids are the same dreams that all of us have. They want their kids to have a first-class education. They know from practical experience that a good education is absolutely essential to making a good living and to making a good life. So let me just share a little from that meeting. [PERSON] told me about her son, [PERSON]. The [PERSON] are here with us somewhere here [DATE] whoops, here she is over here. Her kid starred on [ORG], and that says something about the guy, if you go on that program and come off in [CARDINAL] piece. [Laughter] He must be doing real well. But here is what she said, and this is serious. She said, At his old school that was crowded, he used to get so bored that he would walk out. And thanks to the choice program in [GPE], he is at a new school. He is not doing those things anymore. He is doing his homework; he is even helping clean up the classroom after school. They took the energy and turned it around. Now, the Governor here, [PERSON], the Governor of [GPE], is here with us [DATE]. I am sorry that [PERSON], who is been at the forefront of the school choice movement, could not be here, but she is at home looking after her mother. I would salute her values. But we miss her very, very much. Together, [PERSON] and [PERSON], the Governor, have taken the lead in helping parents like [PERSON] realize her dreams for her son [PERSON], creating scholarships for [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [GPE] children from low-income families so that they can attend private schools. Now, theirs is a bold experiment, to give low-income families more of the same choices of schools already available to wealthier families. [PERSON] of [ORG] was also in our meeting. And [ORG] recently joined with other foundations and [GPE] businesses to raise [MONEY] so that [GPE]'s low-income families will be able to choose their family's schools, including the religious schools. [PERSON] told us [TIME] that parents picked up every [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] scholarship applications [DATE] after the scholarships were announced, [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL], that fast. And do not let anybody tell you that the people of [GPE] do not care about their kids' education. No one should underestimate what is at stake here. A revolution is underway in [GPE] and across this country, a revolution to make [NORP] schools the best in the world. I salute our Secretary of [ORG] who is helping lead that revolution, [PERSON]. Together with the Nation's Governors, we have set [CARDINAL] ambitious national education goals. And I might say that this was not a partisan move; [NORP] and [NORP] alike of the Governors coming together to set [CARDINAL] ambitious national education goals. In [CARDINAL] States and [CARDINAL] communities, we have already launched [GPE] 2000 to meet these goals. Even earlier still, in [DATE], just before I was sworn in as [SPEAKER], we helped organize the White House Conference on Choice in Education. We believed then and we believe [DATE] a few fundamental truths. We believe that parents are their children's first teachers. Parents, not bureaucrats, know what is best for their kids. At this point I would like to salute [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] in purple, [PERSON] for her pointing this out to parents, that it is what they do, what happens in their home. [PERSON]'s done a lot of that here and around the country. I might say that [PERSON]'s taking that same message of parental involvement all across our country, and we are very grateful to her. So, it is our belief then that parents, not the Government, should choose their children's schools. So [DATE] I am proposing that we take another giant step forward in this revolution. I am sending to [ORG] legislation that would authorize an ambitious demonstration program, [MONEY] to help communities all across [GPE] give [MONEY] scholarships to children of middle- and low-income families so they can choose which schools their kids will attend. This revolution is in the greatest [NORP] tradition. We have done it before, and it is worked. [DATE], President [PERSON] signed the GI bill, creating scholarships that veterans could use at any college, any college of their choice. The GI bill created opportunity for [NORP] who never would have had it, and in doing so it helped create the best system of colleges and universities in the world. Now we can do that again, this time by helping [ORG] and local governments and we are delighted the Mayor of [GPE] is with us here [DATE] this time by helping [ORG] and local governments create the best elementary and secondary schools in the world. The GI bill for children will help. It will provide that help to these families. These dollars to spend at the schools of their choice will become the muscle that parents need to create the best schools for their kids. Let me say to those who will attack our school choice initiative on the ground that it permits Government money to go to religious schools, you are wrong. I believe those critics are wrong. This is aid to the families, not aid to institutions. And again, if you set the clock back to the creation of that original GI bill, no one told the GI's that they could not go to [ORG] or [ORG] or [ORG] or [ORG]. I have not heard Members of [ORG] suggest that students stop using Pell grants and guaranteed student loans at [NORP] colleges or [NORP] seminaries. I do not hear an outcry because poor children at [NORP] schools get their lunch paid for by [ORG] taxpayers. In the same way, parents must be free to use this money at the school they believe will best teach their child, whether the school is public, private, or religious. Let me try to be clear on this point: Accepting students with vouchers does not mean a school must sacrifice school prayer. And let me say this to those who stand against extending school choice to low- and middle-income families: I simply do not buy the idea that someone cannot make a good decision just because that person is poor. We heard the same argument when we proposed child care vouchers for low-income families or when we proposed help for public housing tenants to own their own homes. So it is my belief that we ought to let families own their own home and choose their own schools regardless of their income level and give them help. Give them a shot at the [NORP] dream, if you will. Finally, to those who claim that school choice will hurt the public schools, let me underscore this point: All of this new money can go to public schools if that is where the child chooses to go, where the family chooses to have the kid go. That decision will be in the hands of families, where it belongs. There are several points to make about money. First, I want to make it clear that we are not talking here about a new [ORG] entitlement program. [ORG] cannot afford [CARDINAL] more entitlement, even for education. I have said many times that money alone is not the answer. [GPE] already spends more per student for schools than any country in the world except [GPE]. I do not have to tell you where we stand in the international rankings of educational performance at the level we are talking about here [DATE]. Our universities and colleges are respected and have achieved the highest levels of achievement. But that, unfortunately, is not true as we talk about K through 12. So we need a revolution in [NORP] education, not more money to do it the same old way. Investment in our schools will remain a primarily [ORG] and local responsibility. But Federal support for [ORG] and local scholarships can be a catalyst. For schools that attract choice students, it will give teachers and principals a welcome source of new funds. For our children, choice can help open up opportunities, create genuine change in our schools. For too long, we have shielded schools from competition, allowed our schools a damaging monopoly power over our children. This monopoly turns students into statistics and turns parents into pawns. It is time we began thinking of a system of public education in which many providers offer a marketplace of opportunities, opportunities that give all of our children choices and access to the best education in the world. And so it is our firm belief, it is our firm belief that this GI bill for children will move [GPE] inevitably in that direction. [PERSON] once said, Revolutions do not go backward. [GPE] is not the only place in [GPE] that our revolution is underway. [DATE] in [GPE], [PERSON] and [ORG] began to offer tuition vouchers to [GPE] students. I understand a bus-load of parents and students drove [TIME] to be here [DATE]. If you are still awake, welcome, a special welcome to all of you. In [GPE], [ORG] has earmarked [MONEY] in vouchers for children in their community. [GPE]: [PERSON] and [CARDINAL] of supporters are pushing for a ballot initiative to provide voucher scholarships for every school-age child in the State. Overall in [DATE], [CARDINAL] States approved some form of new choice legislation, and [CARDINAL] States had choice legislation pending in [CARDINAL] form or another. I have been told that there may just be a few folks here from [GPE]. [Applause] We are outnumbered. Well, it may take a few tries, but I never underestimate the persistence of parents: The children of [GPE] will have school choice. From [GPE] to [GPE], from coast to coast, the leaders of the school choice movement are sparking a revolution in [NORP] education. They are the true heroes of this education reform, and some of them are here with us [DATE]. They are not afraid to stand up to the status quo, to say loud and clear that when it comes to educating our kids, business-as-usual simply is not good enough. Let there be no mistake: [PERSON] and I and the Vice President and [PERSON], and certainly our Secretary, are very proud to stand with you. You see, this revolution will succeed. It will succeed because it draws its strength from the very heart of the [NORP] creed. We have no truth more enduring than the idea that every [NORP] should have the opportunity for a first-class education. We have no principles more important than freedom, opportunity, and choice. So thank you very, very much. And look at it this way, you are doing the Lord's work for our Nation's future, and you are doing it for the young people of this country. We are grateful to all of you. And may God bless [GPE]. And now I will sign this legislation.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingthenormalizationdiplomaticrelationswithvietnam", "text": "Thank you very much. I welcome you all here, those who have been introduced and distinguished Members of [ORG] and military leaders, veterans, others who are in the audience. [DATE] I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with [GPE]. From the beginning of this administration, any improvement in relationships between [GPE] and [GPE] has depended upon making progress on the issue of [NORP] who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. [DATE], I lifted the trade embargo on [GPE] in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost [NORP] and to determine the fate of those whose remains have not been found. It has worked. In [DATE], [GPE] has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. [CARDINAL] families have received the remains of their loved ones and at last have been able to give them a proper burial. [GPE] has delivered to us [CARDINAL] of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to [NORP] in [GPE]. And [GPE] has stepped up its cooperation with [GPE], where many [NORP] were lost. We have reduced the number of socalled discrepancy cases, in which we have had reason to believe that [NORP] were still alive after they were lost, to [CARDINAL]. And we will continue to work to resolve more cases. [CARDINAL] of dedicated men and women are working on all these cases, often under extreme hardship and real danger in the mountains and jungles of [GPE]. On behalf of all [NORP], I want to thank them. And I want to pay a special tribute to General [PERSON], who has worked so tirelessly on this issue for [SPEAKER]s [PERSON] and [PERSON] and for our administration. He has made a great difference to a great many families. And we as a nation are grateful for his dedication and for his service. Thank you, sir. I also want to thank the [SPEAKER]ial delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], who have helped us to make so much progress on this issue. And I am especially grateful to the leaders of the families and the veterans organizations who have worked with the delegation and maintained their extraordinary commitment to finding the answers we seek. Never before in the history of warfare has such an extensive effort been made to resolve the fate of soldiers who did not return. Let me emphasize, normalization of our relations with [GPE] is not the end of our effort. From [DATE] of this administration I have said to the families and veterans groups what I say again here: We will keep working until we get all the answers we can. Our strategy is working. Normalization of relations is the next appropriate step. With this new relationship we will be able to make more progress. To that end, I will send another delegation to [GPE] [DATE]. And [GPE] has pledged it will continue to help us find answers. We will hold them to that pledge. By helping to bring [GPE] into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful [GPE] in a stable and peaceful Asia. We will begin to normalize our trade relations with [GPE], whose economy is now liberalizing and integrating into the economy of the Asia-Pacific region. Our policy will be to implement the appropriate [ORG] programs to develop trade with [GPE] consistent with [GPE] law. As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. We have already begun discussing human rights issues with [GPE], especially issues regarding religious freedom. Now we can expand and strengthen that dialog. The Secretary of [ORG] will go to [GPE] in [DATE] where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our POW and MIA concerns. I believe normalization and increased contact between [NORP] and [NORP] will advance the cause of freedom in [GPE], just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former [GPE]. I strongly believe that engaging the [NORP] on the broad economic front of economic reform and the broad front of democratic reform will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in [GPE]. I am proud to be joined in this view by distinguished veterans of the [GPE] war. They served their country bravely. They are of different parties. [DATE] they had different judgments about the war which divided us so deeply. But [DATE] they are of a single mind. They agree that the time has come for [GPE] to move forward on [GPE]. All [NORP] should be grateful especially that Senators [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and Representative [PERSON], along with other [GPE] veterans in the [ORG], including Senator [PERSON], Congressman [PERSON], and Congressman [PERSON], who just left, and others who are out here in the audience have kept up their passionate interest in [GPE] but were able to move beyond the haunting and painful past toward finding common ground for the future. [DATE] they and many other veterans support the normalization of relations, giving the opportunity to [GPE] to fully join the community of nations and being true to what they fought for [DATE]. Whatever we may think about the political decisions of the [GPE] era, the brave [NORP] who fought and died there had noble motives. They fought for the freedom and the independence of the [NORP] people. [DATE] the [NORP] are independent, and we believe this step will help to extend the reach of freedom in [GPE] and, in so doing, to enable these fine veterans of [GPE] to keep working for that freedom. This step will also help our own country to move forward on an issue that has separated [NORP] from one another for too long now. Let the future be our destination. We have so much work ahead of us. This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds. They have resisted time for too long. We can now move on to common ground. Whatever divided us before let us consign to the past. Let this moment, in the words of the Scripture, be a time to heal and a time to build. Thank you all, and God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksappliedmaterialsincaustintexas", "text": "Hello, [PERSON]! How you doing? Well, it is wonderful to see all of you here [DATE]. First of all, give [PERSON] an outstanding round of applause for the great job that she did. It is wonderful to be here at [ORG]. I want to thank [PERSON] and everybody who helped out hosting us and a wonderful tour of the facility. It was incredible. [PERSON] was showing me some of your clean rooms where you are building the equipment that makes the chips that is basically powering that is basically powering everything that you guys are taking pictures with right now. [Laughter] Smartphones, computers, iPads, laptops. And it is just remarkable to see. Every time I walk through these kinds of facilities, I am thinking: now, this is just magic. I do not know how they do it. Somebody was explaining to me that I guess [CARDINAL] of the wafers was being cleaned, and he said, this would be the equivalent it was [PERSON] who told me this; [PERSON] is around here somewhere-the equivalent of, if you were mowing the South Lawn, but every blade of grass was exactly cut at the same height within a single human hair. That is how precise things are. That sounds pretty precise to me. And if that is , by the way, the precision that you operate on, if that is how you define a clean room, then [PERSON] and [PERSON] are going to have to step up their game at home. Because it is not that clean. I want to thank your Mayor, [PERSON], and-who is doing a great job. [PERSON] is doing outstanding work [DATE] and helping to bring the [GPE] community together. Congressman [PERSON] is here. They have been great hosts. We actually have a special guest: The Mayor of [GPE] in the house, my friend [PERSON] is here. Now, I have spent [DATE] in [GPE] talking with folks about what we can do to reignite the true engine of [GPE]'s economic growth: a thriving, rising middle class and a dynamic, cutting-edge economy. That is our priority. That should be [GPE]'s top priority. And I see [CARDINAL] things that we need to focus on to do it. Number [CARDINAL], we have got to make [GPE] a magnet for good jobs. Number [CARDINAL], we have got to help people earn the skills they need to do those jobs. Number [CARDINAL], we have got to make sure people's hard work is rewarded so that they can make a decent living doing those jobs. And if you watch the news sometimes, you may think that there is just doom and gloom out there. But the truth is, there is incredible stuff going on all across [GPE] and right here in [GPE] that I think can be good models for the rest of [GPE] to follow. [TIME] I visited [ORG] where students are learning high-tech skills that companies like [ORG] are looking for right now. They are getting excited, working with math and science and technology and engineering. And it is a hands-on high school, where subjects are integrated and kids are building things and conducting experiments at very early ages. And it is sparking their imagination in ways that may lead them to start up the next [ORG] or come here and work at [ORG]. And then I joined a few local families for lunch to talk about how we can make sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and raise a family, with health care that you can count on and the chance to put away some money for retirement. And we also had good barbecue which is necessary for economic growth. [Laughter] Some good barbecue once in a while. And then I came to [ORG] to talk about what we can do to make [GPE] a magnet for new jobs in manufacturing. And after shedding jobs for [DATE], our manufacturers have added now [CARDINAL], 000 new manufacturing jobs over [DATE]. That is good news. [ORG] is bringing jobs back from [GPE], and [ORG] is bringing jobs back from [GPE]. And after placing plants in other countries like [GPE], [ORG] is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. [DATE], [ORG] started making Macs in [GPE] again. So there are some good trend lines there, but we have got to do everything we can to strengthen that trend. We have got to do everything we can to help the kind of high-tech manufacturing that you are doing right here at [ORG]. And we want to make sure it takes root here in [GPE] and all across the country. And that means, first of all, creating more centers of high-tech manufacturing. [DATE], we launched our first manufacturing innovation institute in [GPE], [GPE], to develop new technologies and equip workers with the skills required to master 3-D printing techniques. And in my State of the Union Address, I called on [ORG] to set up [CARDINAL] more of these manufacturing hubs all across [GPE], and I said that my administration was going to go ahead and move forward with [CARDINAL] new hubs on our own, even without congressional action. Well, [DATE] we are launching a competition for those hubs. We are looking for businesses and universities that are willing to partner together to help their region help turn their region into global centers of high-tech jobs. Because we want the next revolution in manufacturing to be made in [GPE]. We are going to do that. The truth is, over [DATE], too many communities have been hit hard when plants closed down and jobs dried up. The economy obviously is changing all the time. Nobody knows that better than folks here at [ORG]. I was talking to somebody who is after showing me the wafer and some chips, and then they showed me a smartphone, they pointed to the smartphone, and they said, [DATE], there'd be [MONEY] just trying to get this much computing power in this little thing, except it would fill up a whole room. And so the economy is dynamic. Technology is constantly changing. That means we have got to adapt as well. And even as we are working to reverse the trend of communities that have been hard hit with old manufacturing leaving, we have got to propose partnerships with local leaders in manufacturing communities to help attract new investment in the infrastructure and the research that will attract new jobs and new businesses so that communities that have been knocked down can get back up and get back on their feet. And we should help our workers get the training they need to compete for the industries of [DATE]. No job in [GPE] should go unfilled just because we do not have anybody with the right skills. And that is a priority. Now, some of your colleagues that I met, some of them have advanced degrees. Some of them came to apply basically right out of high school. But all of you, whether it was in some cases through a university education, in some cases the military, in some cases just on-the-job training, all of you have specialized skills that are exactly what we need to continue to grow our economy. But we have got a whole bunch of folks out there who do not have those skills, either because the education system failed them or because their skills have been rendered obsolete. And that is why I want to rethink how our high school kids are prepared. I want to make sure that we are training [CARDINAL] [NORP] at our community colleges for skills that will lead directly to a job. We and that is also why we have got to make sure that college is affordable and people are not burdened by a mountain of debt so that they can continue to upgrade their skills as well. Now, if we want to manufacture the best products, we have also got to invest in and cultivate the best ideas. All right? Innovation, ingenuity, that is the constant of the [NORP] economy. That is one of the constants of our character. It is what keeps [GPE] on the cutting edge. And just before I came here, I visited [ORG], which, as some of you know, is a place that helps startups take off. And everywhere you turn, somebody has got a new idea. They are all thinking big. They are taking risks. It is exciting. There was a young woman who is in a wheelchair and physically disabled, but is just incredibly inspired to make sure that she is not in any way confined by that situation. And she is basically designed and is now manufacturing a car that people in wheelchairs can just drive their wheelchair right into the car and start driving. And then you had a young man who had a 3-D camera it was about this big and basically from filming either a static image or in the round, can basically download that immediately and create a 3-D image and then use that for 3-D manufacturing 3-D printing and manufacturing. And what currently costs [MONEY], 000, costs [MONEY] the technology that he is developed. So they are doing amazing stuff. And one of the things we are doing to fuel more inventiveness like thisto fuel more private sector innovation and discoveryis to make the vast amounts of [GPE]'s data open and easy to access for the first time in history. So talented entrepreneurs are doing some pretty amazing stuff with data that is already being collected by [ORG]. So over at [ORG], I met with folks behind the startup called Stormpulse, which uses [ORG] data on weather to help businesses anticipate disruptions in service. And then you have got a [GPE] company called [ORG], that is used [ORG] data on trends in energy use to save its customers [MONEY] on their energy bills. There is an app called iTriage, founded by a pair of ER doctors that uses data from [ORG] to help users understand medical symptoms and find local doctors and health care providers. And [DATE] I am announcing that we are making even more Government data available and we are making it easier for people to find and to use. And that is going to help launch more startups. It is going to help launch more businesses. Some of them undoubtedly will be using this data powered by chips that essentially started right here at [ORG]. It is going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we have not even imagined yet. This kind of innovation and ingenuity has the potential to transform the way we do almost everything. [CARDINAL] of jobs in [GPE] are now supported by the tech sector. And we should do all that we can to encourage this kind of innovation economy all across [GPE], in ways that produce new jobs and new opportunities for the middle class. And we are poised for a time of progress if we are willing to seize it. Not even [DATE] after the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, our jobs market and our housing market are steadily healing. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in [DATE]. The [NORP] auto industry has made a comeback; it is thriving. [NORP] energy is booming. But we have got to keep on moving forward, and we have got to make sure that [GPE] is not administering self-inflicted wounds when we are making progress. So [PERSON] and I were talking about the fact that if we can reform our tax system to eliminate some of these loopholes, potentially, we could lower some rates. That would make our businesses more competitive. Basic research, you will hear people talk about how government is not going to do anything for us. Well, we all understand that the private sector powers and drives our economy. On the other hand, most of the private sector right now has a lot of trouble financing basic research. And that basic research is the foundation for everything that is done at this company, and everything that is done for most of your customers. And we cannot afford to fall behind when it comes to basic research. So there is some key things that we can do that should not be ideological. They are not [NORP] ideas or [NORP] ideas or [NORP] ideas, they are just good ideas that allow the government to help create the foundation, the platform, the environment in which companies like [ORG] can thrive. And that is what we have got to constantly champion. And when you are talking to your Members of [ORG] or you are talking to elected officials, you have got to remind them we do not want government to do everything for us, but it is got a role to play on infrastructure, basic research, making sure that we have got a fair a tax system that is fair, making sure that we have got some basic stability in our budget so people are not always guessing what is going to happen around the corner. Think about how this company was built. Back in [DATE], when [ORG] was just getting off the ground, there were [CARDINAL] employees. They worked out of this small industrial unit in [GPE]. And I suppose they had a clean room in there, but I do not know what it looked like. [Laughter] But what they lacked in size, they made up with ingenuity and imagination and risk-taking. And over [DATE], as you grew to become a leader in high-tech manufacturing, that ingenuity never faltered. Whether you have been with this company for [DATE] as I know some of you have or just for [DATE], you are all focused on the future. [DATE], you are pushing the limits of technology a little bit further. And you are not alone, because somewhere over at [ORG], there is an entrepreneur mapping out a new product on a whiteboard that may be the next big thing. Somewhere over at [ORG], there is a kid scribbling down an idea for a new invention that [DATE] may turn into an entirely new industry. That is [GPE]. And when you look out across this room, what you also notice is there is talent drawn from every segment of our society. We do not care what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is. We just want to make sure we are all working together to create a better future for our kids. That is [GPE]. We innovate. And we adapt. We move forward. That is what [GPE] is all about. That is what is going on in this city. And that is what I want to keep on promoting as your [SPEAKER] of [GPE]. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

My hat is off to [GPE] and its police force for their dedicated and often thankless battle against crime. And I congratulate [ORG] for caring enough about its community that it sponsors the [ORG] program. I understand that [MONEY], 000 in those prize moneys that Mr. [PERSON] mentioned have been given out so far, and that is quite an investment in our collective peace of mind. By working together, the city and [ORG] are another example of how our public and private institutions can be made even more effective in improving the quality of our lives. But most of all, I want to thank these citizens here for-they are everyday [NORP]-thank them for their courage in unexpected circumstances and for their becoming heroes they were. You know, someone once said that a hero is not braver than anyone else. He is just brave [TIME] longer. [Laughter] I do not know whether that is the answer or not, but God bless them all. And those who say we are in a time when there are no heroes, they just do not know where to look. They certainly have not been flipping through the pages of [ORG] lately. I wish all our people could read, as I have, the accounts of your individual acts of heroism. In each case you seem to think you acted as anyone else would have in the same situation. And you spoke from your hearts about how we all depend on one another. [PERSON] said, I just hope people will realize that we must all work together, citizens and police. If somebody needs help, we should try to help out. You have got to try. Well, when you read how the [PERSON] brothers chased down a purse-snatcher wielding a knife; how Mrs. [PERSON], a grandmother, collared a pickpocket by his neck scarf and gave him the back of her hand until the police arrived-I liked the picture of that one more than anything- [laughter] -and how Rabbi [PERSON] immobilized a mugger armed with a machete; you realize there is nothing very average about the average [NORP]. Sometimes I have accused some of our political opponents of referring so much about the common man, and I prefer to think that most [NORP] are pretty uncommon. Here in [GPE] teeming streets and boroughs and in towns and cities across [GPE], our people do care about each other. And they are ready to help. From cabbies to construction workers to youths to grandmothers and an airman from [GPE], the people of [GPE] are leading the way in what has become a national citizens campaign to restore security to our streets and neighborhoods. Working with their local police, they are getting results. Seeing men and women like yourselves here [DATE] in what some say is the busiest precinct in the county-or in the country, I should say, I believe we can and we will rid ourselves of the fear that plagued us. I like to think, also, that we are not only going to rid ourselves of the fear; we are going to transfer that fear to where those skulking people who try to take advantage of their fellow citizens are not going to just look around for the uniform. They are just going to look around and say, I cannot trust these people anymore, cannot trust them to go their own way and not take us on. Together we are working toward the day when law-abiding men and women can live in confidence and, as I say, only the criminals will be afraid. On behalf of all [NORP], I thank [ORG]. I thank [ORG] and [GPE]. I will tell your story wherever I go, because I know your courage will inspire others. In the meantime, your fellow citizens are grateful that you have made the world a little safer, a little more free, and filled with a great deal more hope.

Thank you, and God bless you. I want to thank all the dinner chairs and Chairman [PERSON] and your [ORG] chairman, [PERSON], and my former colleagues [PERSON] and [PERSON], and [PERSON], who I have been enjoying for a year or [CARDINAL] now, since I was a younger man. I want to say a special word of appreciation to [PERSON] because it is his birthday [TIME], so I know we are all glad . I want to thank Senator [PERSON] for what he said and for what he is done in [GPE], for standing up especially for the environment under a period of incredibly intense assault from the majority in [ORG]. Yes, you ought to clap for him because he did that. And as he leaves [ORG], I'd like to thank Senator [PERSON] for [DATE] of service to [GPE] and to [GPE], for [DATE] of friendship, counsel, and advice to me, and for the support that he gave this administration in [DATE]. I know we all wish him well, and we know that the next chapter of his life will doubtless be just as exciting as the ones that have gone before. Thank you very much, [PERSON], and God bless you. You know, there have been a lot of sort of asides [TIME] about why Congressman [PERSON] is not here. I think he is here for you, because he is down there voting on something you care about. And I have a message for those if there was some designed effort to keep him from coming up here [DATE], guess what? He is still going to get the contributions, and we still know where he is, and we know what is at stake, and we are going to elect him in [DATE], so it does not make any difference. [CARDINAL] thing you know about [PERSON] is that he will stand up and fight for you with every fiber of his being. He does not do anything halfway; he is full of passion. He will fight for the water you drink, the land you live on, the air you breathe, the education of your children, the safety of your streets, and the example of your country as a beacon of freedom and democracy. He is been leading the fight to protect Sterling Forest here, the watershed for most of northern [GPE]. He wrote a section of the Superfund act that is focused on the chemical sites that are polluted here, something I am determined to see us finish the work on and another reason I do not want to see any further attempts to erode our investment in environmental protection. [PERSON] will protect all that. So I ask you to do what you can for [DATE] to send [PERSON] to [ORG]. [PERSON] shoes may be impossible to fill, but the people of [GPE] deserve someone fighting for them who is on their side and fighting for their future, not someone in the grip of an ideological theory that will only undermine our ability to go forward together. So I ask you again, do what you can, send him to the [ORG]. Do what you can for yourselves and your children and your future. We need [PERSON], and I am going to depend on you to deliver [GPE] for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to keep you a long time [TIME], but I want to just give a speech that in some ways is not particularly political. And after, I am going to ask you to do something that is intensely political. Usually these fundraisers we all know that our political system would not work without them, but a lot of times I think you come and go and you have your blood stirred, but I wonder if, when you leave, you think you have done your part and that is all there is to it. I want to talk to you [TIME] about what I believe is really going on in this country now, what I think is really at stake in this election, and why I hope you believe your financial contributions are only the beginning of your responsibilities as citizens for [DATE]. We are clearly living through a time of change as profound as any [GPE] has endured in [DATE] in terms of the ways we work and live. Every so often our country is confronted with huge challenges, either to our very existence or at least to the ideals with which we started, that all of us are created equal and that we have inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the Government is instituted to promote the general, the common welfare. We had a lot of trouble getting started in working that out. Then we had to fight a great Civil War to hold the country together and to redeem the promise of equality by extending it when it had to be extended. And then, [DATE], we faced a period of change rather like [DATE], when we moved from the farm to the factory, from the country to the city. There were vast new opportunities, but there was a lot of uprooting; a lot of people's lives were dislocated. And the progressive era began, with [PERSON] and [PERSON] saying that the power of [ORG] should be used to curb the abuses of that era and to make sure its benefits could be extended to all [NORP]. They had the antitrust laws, the child laws, the environment protection laws, all designed to let us have the benefits of the new industrial age without being broken by it, without having our identity as a nation, our character as a people, our ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution savaged. That is what it was all about. And then we underwent the Depression and World War II, and President [PERSON] and the [ORG] and the leaders of that time had to, first of all, defeat the opponents of freedom who would have killed our way of life beyond our borders and rally the [NORP] people to overcome that profound Depression and find a way to build a safety net under this country so that we could manage our economy in ways that did not permit it to crash again and break the lives of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of people. Then we had to gird ourselves for the cold war, which we did, and wait for our victory to come, because communism was always founded on a total misunderstanding of human nature and the human condition. Now we are going through another period of change, economic and social change and the way we relate to the rest of the world, sort of like what happened [DATE]. Now we have moved from a cold-war world to a global society, not just a global economy. Now we have moved from an industrial age to one in which all work is dominated by information and technology and has vast ramifications which [GPE] has felt for the organization of work: big companies dramatically downsizing; new companies starting at a rapid rate; a lot of people doing exceedingly well; other people left behind; other people feeling uncertain about their future. When I ran for [INTERVIEWED] in [DATE], I got into that race because I was convinced we could no longer just sit by and let it happen, that we needed an aggressive response. And I said then what I repeat to you now: I still believe our vision for the future should be animated by [CARDINAL] things: [CARDINAL], the desire to give the [NORP] dream of opportunity to every person in this country without regard to their race, their gender, their station in life, where they live, and what they are up against. That ought to be the first thing. [CARDINAL], the understanding that we cannot achieve that in the world in which we are living unless we find a way to come together to respect our diversity, to bridge all those gaps of race and religion and region and ethnicity. This country now has, more or less, [CARDINAL] different racial and ethnic groups. It is an astonishing thing that we can find ways to come together around our core values and our respect for one another's differences. And I am sick and tired of seeing elections used as wedges to divide people one from another, to try to get people who are in the majority to look down on those who are not , and then hope we can pick up the pieces after the election. We should be uniting the [NORP] people and going forward together. And the third thing we have to do is continue to be the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And as I have said many times, that sounds great and everybody is for that in general, but often in particular they are not. When I took the action I did in [GPE] and [GPE], in becoming the first President to try to do something in [GPE], all of the things we have done in the Middle East, what all the polls said was the most unpopular decision of my administration, trying to keep [GPE] from collapsing, everything I did, I did because I know that our country has got to try to be the world's greatest source of energy for peace and freedom and prosperity, and because I know that [DATE] we can be the strongest country in the world, but others will grow stronger, and we have to work with [GPE], we have to work with [GPE], we have to work with a uniting Europe, we have to work with emerging countries, to have them define their greatness in a way that helps us all to go forward in peace and prosperity. How will these other countries define their greatness? Will it be as we do, by how well they educate their people and what their economic achievements are and what their cultural achievements are and whether they can help their less fortunate neighbors? Or will it be by whether they can bully people just because they are smaller than they are? This a big issue. We cannot walk away from this. You cannot live in the world we are going toward and pretend to stay within your own borders. So that is what I tried to do in [DATE]. And ever since I have been in this office, everything I have done can be explained in terms of either trying to create opportunity or to bring us together around our basic values and respecting our diversity or maintaining our leadership for peace and freedom. And you heard Senator [PERSON] talking about it. It is true that we are better off [DATE] than we were [DATE], [CARDINAL] jobs better off. The deficit is [CARDINAL] of what it was. The crime rate is down. The welfare rolls are down. We are moving in the right direction. That is true. It is also true that there are a lot of challenges out there. In the economic arena, we have [CARDINAL] big challenges, do not we? In [GPE], you know what [CARDINAL] of them is. We have to figure out what to do about all these people who get downsized from big companies but who still have a lot of good years left. And we are working on that. In [DATE], I am going to have a lot of companies in the country come in, and we are going to highlight the companies that have been able to avoid that and have been able to do things that really help their employees if they have to leave. We have got to find a way, secondly, to give all of our working people a greater sense of economic security. I have heard Senator [PERSON] talk about this. If you cannot guarantee somebody the same job with the same company for a lifetime, then they have to know if they work hard and play by the rules, they will always be able to get new training for new work, they will always have access to health care, and they will always be able to have a pension they can carry around with them, even if they change jobs. They have to be able to know that. And lastly, we have to remember that here in [GPE] and throughout this country, in spite of the [CARDINAL] jobs, there are vast expanses within our inner cities and in our rural areas that have not felt any new investment opportunity. And do not kid yourself, when you have new jobs and growth, you also drive down the welfare rolls, you drive down the crime rate, you drive down the despair that people feel. So we have to find a way to bring free enterprise back to the inner cities and back to the rural areas of [GPE]. I know we can do it. If we can do it for other countries, we can do it for our own. If you look at this great country of ours, and you ask, how can we come together instead of be driven apart, you have to start with our basic values. We need to build up families and the integrity and strength of childrearing, not tear it down. That is why I have said many times, I am all for welfare reform that is tough on work if people can work, but I do not want to hurt the children. We should be supportive of good parenting and work. All of us try to succeed as workers and parents. That is what we should want poor people to do, too. Everybody should be able to succeed in that way. That should be our goal. We have to create an educational system that gives everybody genuine opportunity. And that means, among other things, what I was doing here in [GPE] [DATE], which is ensuring that we hook up every classroom and every library, even in the poorest schools in [GPE], to the information superhighway in [DATE]. We can do that, and we can revolutionize education if we do it. We have got to continue our work to lower the crime rate by having more police on the street, more prevention strategies, being tough in keeping the assault weapons ban in the Brady bill and not giving them up, and by actually doing something to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to. We can bring the crime rate down; we can make our streets safe again; we can make our neighborhoods whole again. We know how to do it. The question is whether we will. We have to continue this fight to protect the environment. It is woefully short-sighted to believe that we can walk away from our obligations to clean up the messes we have made and protect ourselves from making further ones and gain anything economically by it. Yes, we have to find smarter ways to do it. Our administration has worked hard to find ways to grow the economy and clean the environment. But if we walk away from that, we will not go into [DATE] as a country that is stronger with stronger families and stronger communities and a stronger future. All of these things we must do. We have to keep working and reaching out to the rest of the world, even when it is frustrating, when there are no easy answers. And to do it, we have to have an idea of Government that is fundamentally different from that embraced by the congressional majority. If you listen to them, what they say is, Government is the source of all of our problems; this new world is going to be so wonderful; if we could just get Government out of the way, all of our problems would be solved; what we need is empowerment defined as more choice and freedom from Government. If you listen to our crowd, what do we say? We are not for big Government anymore where it is not necessary. Just remember, folks, when election time comes, they bad-mouth the Government, but we are the ones that reduced it. It is [CARDINAL] smaller [DATE] than it was [DATE] I became [INTERVIEWED]. But we did it in a way that treated those [ORG] workers with dignity. We gave them generous early retirement packages and severance packages and time to find other jobs. And we did not try to make some big thing out of it. We just did it because it needed to be done. But we believe that there is a different sort of empowerment. We believe that real opportunity means not only choice but the ability to exercise the choice. You remember the great [NORP] writer [PERSON] said the rich and poor are equally free to sleep under the bridge at [TIME]. Now, that is what choice is without the capacity to exercise it. We believe our job in [GPE] is to give people the ability to make the most of their own lives as individuals, workers, as citizens, in families, in communities, and as citizens of this great [ORG]. That is what we believe, the power to make the most of their own lives. We cannot guarantee results for people, but if we do not make sure everybody has got a chance to do the most that they can with their lives and live out their dreams, this country will never be what it ought to be in [DATE]. That is the main choice you face in [DATE]. And let me say, in terms of the election, why you have to work at it. This is a complicated time. There is a lot of kind of paradox out there. And you have to talk to people about what the nature of this time is, what the nature of this period of change is, and what should we be doing. And every one of you who can afford to be here [TIME] has a voice, a mind, a spirit that can be brought to bear on your friends and neighbors. And you need to take this opportunity to use this election as elections should always be used, as a genuine educational opportunity to learn about where we are. And every question then becomes, how do we do this in a way that gives everybody a chance to make the most of their own lives? How do we do this in a way that brings the [NORP] people together and does not divide them? How do we do this in a way that maintains our leadership in the world for peace and freedom? So it is not a question of whether we balance the budget. We have reduced the deficit more than our predecessors. The question is, how we balance the budget, not whether we do it. So in every case, I ask you to think about this. And you are quite fortunate now, you do not have to guess. You do not have to guess. You know what the choices are. You can look at the budget of [DATE], which I vetoed, at the environmental initiatives, at the differences between us. And you do not have to guess. Who is right about family and medical leave? Were we right to say that you should not lose your job if you have got to take a little time off when a baby is born or a parent is sick or a child is in the hospital? Or were they? We said yes, and they said no. We now have gotten a bipartisan study of the family and medical leave law that says [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] [NORP] workers covered by the law have taken advantage of it, and [PERCENT] of the businesses say it did not cost them any money to comply and did not cause them any problems. I think that is what we are about. All we did was to empower people to succeed at work and at home. That is what we should be doing. I think we were right. Were we right? Were we right to fight for the [CARDINAL] 000 police and the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill? Were we right? I believe we were. All I know is that the crime rate is down all across [GPE] now for [DATE] in a row because of more police and prevention. All I know is that no lawful hunter has lost his or her weapon, but there are [CARDINAL] 000 people who did lose their weapons, the [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people with criminal records who tried to buy a handgun and could not do it because of the Brady bill in [DATE]. Were we right to fight for national service, to give people a chance to serve their community, solve the problems, work with people of different backgrounds, and earn some money to go to college, or were they right to say that is a luxury we cannot afford? Were we right to change the student loan laws so that more people could borrow money to go to college on better terms and pay it back as a percentage of their income so that if you have a high tuition cost but you want to be a schoolteacher, a police officer, a nurse, or somebody else doing public service and you know you are not going to be rich, you still can always borrow the money to go to college, and you can still always pay it back? I believe we were right about that. And in every case, there was no big Government guarantee. All we were trying to do was to give people the means to make the most of their own lives, to seize the [NORP] dream, to come together instead of being divided, to stand up for the things we believe in around the world. That is all we did, and it makes all the difference. So I say to you, this is not like [DATE] when the question was the status quo or change. There is no status quo option. There are [CARDINAL] very different views of change. They can be well-known and completely understood. The question is, which road will you walk into [DATE]? And I tell you, I see pictures in my mind all the time that give me the answer. The other day I was at [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE], where all of the students are [NORP] except the [NORP] exchange students, a program you have done a lot of work on. There they were, reaching for unity over diversity. There they were, struggling to come out of poverty. There they were, asking not for a guarantee, but just for a good education and a chance at the [NORP] dream. And if I have got anything to do about it, they are going to get it. That is what they are going to get. I got [CARDINAL] letters from [CARDINAL] married couples I got to know not very long ago because they had desperately sick children. I know as the father of [CARDINAL] child, there must be no greater pain in the world than having a child die before you do. And both these couples lost their children, but they got to be good parents because of the family and medical leave law that they helped us fight for. I think we were right, and I think that is the kind of change we want. I got a letter that I signed [DATE] back to a man who is now in [DATE] who lost a job [DATE] at an aerospace plant, did not know where to turn. But he wrote us, and because we found him the kind of training program that others are trying to eliminate, that man started his life over again in [DATE] and is working again and has dignity and is supporting himself and his family. That is what I believe we ought to be doing. This is not complicated. It is not about big Government programs. It is not about [DATE]'s ideas. This is about which road we will walk into the future. It is about whether we will walk it together. [DATE] in [GPE], basically your good anybody here from there? I was over there [DATE] at the high school. We were at the high school; Senator [PERSON] talked about it. We did this antismoking program. And I was talking to the mayor on the way in about what kind of community it was. He said, it is sort of a standard [GPE] blue-collar community, and it was. It was, except they had not only [NORP] and [NORP] among the student body, they had [NORP] and [NORP] among the student body, even there. [GPE] is changing. I am telling you, this business of trying to drive a stake between people in this country based on their race, their ethnic background, or their religion has got to stop. We have got to stop it. We have got to stop it. Now, you do not have to guess about this; look around the rest of the world. Which road do you want to walk into the future? And I know that either I or my successors will make some mistakes in our judgments about what [GPE] should do around the world. But basically, it is right for us to continue to reach out to other countries. It is right for us to support peace and freedom and to try to expand our own prosperity by expanding that of others. It is right for us to be partners with other countries, even when we are tired and we want to lay our burdens down, because it is the only way to fight terrorism, the only way to fight drug dealing, the only way to fight organized crime; it is right to do that. So you get to decide about that, which road will you walk into the future. And I want to ask you when you leave here [TIME] to think about what else you can do for [DATE]. I appreciate the money you have given [PERSON] and [ORG] and our efforts. I am grateful for that. But it is not enough, because the [NORP] people are trying to get a grip on this period of change. They are trying to understand what is going on, and you can help. And it is exciting. You should feel privileged to live in this time. Believe me, there is a lot more good than bad in it. Believe me, if we do the right things, the children that are here in this audience will have the opportunity to live out their dreams more than any previous generation of [NORP] ever has. You should be happy and proud to have the responsibility of citizenship at this time. And so I ask you as you leave [TIME] to think about it: What do you want [GPE] to look like for your children and grandchildren, and what are you willing to do to make it happen? And what do we have to do in [GPE] to help everybody have their chance at the [NORP] dream in a country that is going forward together? That is what is at stake. I think I know what road the [NORP] people will walk into the future if they understand what the choices are. You must help your fellow [NORP] understand the choices. Thank you, [PERSON] bless you, and good [TIME].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraiser11", "text": "Hello, everybody! Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat, especially [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Every time I stand next to them I look like a little kid. I want to thank [CARDINAL] people who are just extraordinarily important to the project of rebuilding our country and have just been great friends of mine, great friends of [ORG]--you already heard from [CARDINAL]--please give it up for Governor [PERSON]; our [ORG] finance chair, [PERSON], who is racking up a lot of frequent flier miles; and [PERSON], our [ORG] treasurer--hey, [PERSON]. It is great to see all of you here [TIME], wonderful to see so many good friends, many of you who were there from the beginning of this campaign. And I want you to all know that I appreciate everything that you have done, not just for the campaign, but also what you have done for the country and what you have done for the party. Many of you were invested in this campaign at the very beginning when nobody could pronounce my name. And you'd tell your friends, There is this young guy, I really think he is got something. What is his name? [PERSON]? Yes. So you had to confront a lot of skepticism, a lot of confusion. Some of you were involved in a campaign for the first time, and some of you got involved for the very first time in a very long time, because you believed that we were in a defining moment in our history and that your voice could make a difference. Not a single day goes by where I do not think about all the time and the energy, the money, the commitment, the unyielding faith that you put into our campaign, because it was not just about winning an election, it was about changing a country. [DATE], we asked you to take on something new. We asked you to help us keep the promises that we made in the campaign, help to bring about the changes that we had talked about together. And a lot of you have worked hard to do that. You have continued to be engaged in education policy, in foreign policy, and helping us at a grassroots level and continuing to finance our ability to get our message out. And it matters. It is made the successes of [DATE] possible. Sometimes I think we got so many things done so quick that people forgot. But let us just think about this: We upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and restored science to its rightful place in [GPE]. We provided health care to [CARDINAL] children who now have it who did not have it before. We passed the strongest veterans budget in [DATE]. We protected families from getting ripped off by credit card companies and children from being targeted by big tobacco, and helped consumers deal with the twin plagues of mortgage fraud and predatory lending. We appointed [PERSON] to [ORG]. We passed a service bill named for [PERSON] that is giving young and old a chance to serve their country and their communities. We are working with [ORG] to finally repeal the law that denies gay [NORP] the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. Oh, by the way, and in the meantime, we prevented the worst financial crisis from getting even worse, turned the economy from contraction to expansion, made the largest investment in clean energy in history, the largest investment in education in [DATE], expanded the Pell grant program, dealt with a H1N1 virus on the side. That is what your support has helped us do at home. Abroad, we have begun a new era of engagement. We are working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We are working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We are rebuilding our military. We are reaffirming our alliances. We have begun to leave [GPE] to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we have charted a new way forward in [GPE] and [GPE]. We are making progress [DATE] in taking the fight to [ORG] and across the globe. And I went to [GPE] on behalf of the [NORP] people to begin a new dialogue with the [NORP] world. We are living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We are living up to a moment that demands [NORP] leadership by standing with the people of [GPE] as we speak. So in ways large and small, we have begun to deliver on the change that we talked about, the change that you believed in and that you campaigned hard for. But the reason that you and I are here [TIME] is because we are not done. We have got a lot more work to do. As I said, [DATE] we took office, we confronted a financial system on the verge of collapse; we were losing [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs per month; a [MONEY] deficit; [CARDINAL] wars that frankly had not been paid for and were costly in every sense of the word. A lot of the solutions we proposed, the decisions we took, they were not quick, they were not easy, and they were not popular. But we decided we were going to go govern, we were going to put politicking on hold to get this country out of the mess it was in. I mentioned this to a group I spoke to earlier. You know, pundits act surprised about the fact that we spent so much political capital. Well, you know, I did not get elected to play it safe. And I did not govern, and I do not govern, by checking the polls [DATE]. I know that is the habit in [GPE], but that is not the obligation I owe the [NORP] people, that is not the promise I made to you. And because we took bold and swift and coordinated action, we can stand here [DATE] and say we averted another depression. We broke the back of the recession. The economy is growing again. So the worst of the storm has passed. But, as all of you know, the devastation remains. We have got [PERCENT] unemployment. Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still cannot find work. This is on top of [DATE] that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They had not seen their incomes go up in [DATE]. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant. For [DATE], I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the [NORP] Dream, was slipping away. That is the reason I ran for [SPEAKER]. That is the reason you supported me. And that is why we are going to continue to do everything we can to create an economy that has not just recovered back to the status quo, but an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded, and where businesses are hiring and wages are rising, and where our middle class is getting stronger and more secure. Now, our most urgent task is job creation. That was our [CARDINAL] priority [DATE] and our [CARDINAL] priority [DATE]. And the first task was to make sure the economy is growing. It is growing. But we have got to do more. So we are going to give tax breaks and loans to small businesses to help them hire new workers and raise their wages and invest in new plants and equipment. We are going to put even more [NORP] to work on clean energy facilities and upgrading our infrastructure to meet the challenges of [DATE]. We are going to create incentives for consumers to make their homes more energy efficient, creating jobs and saving families money. And we are going to look at our Tax Code, because it is time we ended practices like giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas instead of investing in companies that are creating jobs right here in [GPE]. But the truth is, these steps alone will not make up for [CARDINAL] jobs that have been lost over [DATE]. They are not going to, alone, provide the economic security that is been dwindling for middle class families over [DATE]. The only way we do that is to lay a strong foundation for growth over the long term. And the things that we talked about during the campaign are the things that still need to be done. They have been put off by [GPE] for too long. And this is where change gets hard. Change is easy if you are just talking about tinkering around the edges. Change is harder when you actually dig in and try to deal with the structural problems that have impeded our progress for too long. This is where we run headlong into the lobbyists and the special interests and the bitterness and misinformation that characterizes so much of our politics, which means that some of you may be feeling discouraged, because it feels like things have taken longer than you might have expected. Well, do not be discouraged. I am not discouraged. I knew this was going to take a long time, but I knew the fight was worth it. And we have got to keep up on this fight. The forces of the status quo, they may not give an inch, but I do not give an inch either. And you should not give an inch either. We are not--[applause]. We did not come this far to put things off, or to play it safe, or to take the easy road. That was not why we were elected. We came here to solve problems for the next generation, not for the next election. That means opening up this Government to the people. That is why we post all our visitors online. That is why we have excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs and seats on boards and commissions. That is why I have called on [ORG] to put their earmarks online so everybody can see what is going on. That is part of the change that we promised. We have got to change the tone of Government and politics here in [GPE] and all across [GPE]. I am not going to give up on that either. You know, the [NORP] people are right to be frustrated about a [GPE] where [DATE] is [DATE] and the basic theory is, If you lose, I win, where we are not measuring success by what we are doing for the [NORP] people, but how we look in the latest [ORG]. No wonder people are frustrated. That is why I went to the [ORG] [NORP] caucus [DATE]. We had a good discussion-- --about the challenges that are facing the [NORP] people, our ideas to solve them. That was good for the country. It is good for our democracy. I had fun. Now, there are some issues that [NORP] and [NORP] are not going to agree on, and that is okay. Vigorous debate is healthy. We are going to tussle from time to time. And you know what? There may be some issues that we do agree on, or at least we say we agree on. And we have to test whether or not people are serious. So I told my [NORP] friends I want to work together with them where I can, and I meant it, because I do not want to just score political points. I have got time to campaign down the road. In the meantime, there is a lot of work that we have got to get done together. And we can get a lot done together. And I told them I will also call them out if they say they want to work on something and then when I offer a hand I get nothing in return. The [NORP] people have to understand that. The old playbook of just blocking everything, I understand that is easier than actually doing something, and sometimes it may be more politically effective, but that is not what is going to move our country forward. That is why I am here. That is why you joined our campaign. That is what you have helped deliver over [DATE]. That is why I need your help now. That is why [PERSON] and everybody in the party needs your help now, because you know as well as anyone that change does not come without a fight. We have got some fights to wage. We have got some fights to make sure that we are sparking innovation and igniting a clean energy sector where [NORP] workers are making solar panels and wind turbines and cutting-edge batteries for the new plug-in hybrid that leads on clean energy, because the economy that leads on clean energy, I believe, is going to lead the global economy. And I want [GPE] to be that nation. We are going to keep fighting to make sure that [GPE] has the best education possible for every child. And we are going to reward success through our [ORG] program. We want every child to meet their potential, and that is why we are going to make sure that young people all across [GPE] can afford college without going broke. That is a priority. We can do that. And we could do it [DATE]. We are going to keep fighting for commonsense rules of the road for Wall Street. And I want to be clear--there is a lot of talk about Wall Street, Main Street--we need a financial sector that works. That is a priority. We need businesses that are thriving, and they have got to raise capital; that will help them hire workers. So there is no separation between our financial system and the real economy. That is part of what this crisis has reminded us. But we have got to ensure that our economy is not brought to its knees by outdated and antiquated financial rules and the irresponsibility of a few. And that is why I expect [NORP] and [NORP] to want to make sure that we do not find ourselves in this same situation again. That is why we have to have financial regulatory reform. And yes, that is why we are going to fix the health care system, a health care system that too often works for insurance companies better than it does for individual [NORP]. And again, I did not take this on because it was easy. I got [PERSON]; he does all the polls. He whispers in my ear, Man, this health care thing is hard. I am a amateur historian, so I know that [CARDINAL] [SPEAKER]s, starting with [PERSON], could not get this done. We understood this was going to be hard. But I took it on not for its political value; I took it on because families are dealing with skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and insurance companies that routinely deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or drop people altogether when they get sick. We took it on because the costs were killing small businesses and creating an uneven playing field for our international companies, and it was eating into workers' take-home pay and canceling raises. And we took it on because it is the single best way--in fact, the only way--that we are actually going to get control of our [ORG] budget. So when I hear deficit hawks --quote, unquote--out there who say they want to control the [ORG] budget and are not willing to do a darn thing about the skyrocketing costs of health care, I get a sense they are not entirely on the level. Because our proposal for health care reform, according to [ORG], would bring it down by [MONEY] over [DATE]. And even in [GPE] that is a lot of money. I took it on because [DATE], [CARDINAL] [NORP] join [CARDINAL] who do not have health insurance, and [CARDINAL] [NORP] die because of the lack of health insurance. That is what we campaigned on. That is what we are working to get it done, with [NORP] and with [NORP] and with [NORP]. We want to bring down costs and end the worst insurance practices and finally give every [NORP] a chance to have the security of quality, affordable health care. I am not going to walk away from those fights, and I do not expect you will either. You have come this far. I mean, the odds were a lot less that I'd ever be standing here than they are that we can solve some of these big problems. I mean, think about it. [PERSON] was--when [PERSON] endorsed me in [GPE], first endorsement I got outside of [GPE] of any elected official--here he is, newly minted Governor of [GPE]--there was one thing that was clear, and that is he was term limited. But do not you guys--you remember this. Nobody gave us a chance. This campaign was declared dead--what?--10 times. You know, the same folks who are now writing about what next, and what is happened to the [PERSON], these are the same folks who were writing about how he does not stand a chance; how after [GPE], that was it; after [GPE], that was it, right? We went through this. And they were saying your faith was misplaced and that you have set your sights too high and your hope is naive and [ORG] will not change. And now all of them are feeling like, See, we told you, [ORG] does not change. And they are feeling kind of self-satisfied about the fact that we have not yet gotten health care done. Well, let me tell you something. You did not listen to those voices then. Your voice proved them wrong. You proved that nothing can stop the power of [CARDINAL] of people who want to see an [GPE] that is living up to its values and its ideals. That is what you did. And that is what I am asking you to do again. This is an extraordinary moment. I want to remind you, we do not quit. And I do not quit. And we are going to bring about the changes that you believe in and I believe in, and that, ultimately, will help our children and grandchildren believe as they grow up an [GPE] in which everybody's got a decent shot at life, in which we are leading in innovation, in which we are proud of our foreign policy. That is what we were fighting for then. That is what we are fighting for now. We have taken some good steps. We got many miles to go on this journey. I hope you join me. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraiser7", "text": "Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Well, it is good to see all of you here [TIME]. What an incredible honor to be introduced by [PERSON]. Please give [PERSON] a big round of applause. I would not be standing here [DATE] were it not for people like [PERSON]. And how about my new [ORG] chair, [PERSON]. She is tireless--tireless. And she is got the most adorable kids, and I do not know how she keeps up with everything. But as [PERSON] said, If you want something done, put a woman in charge. So-- --all right, everybody got--women, you got a little too excited on that. You know, I have been thinking a lot lately about this campaign gearing back up, and obviously, it evokes memories of [DATE]. And I think back to [TIME] in [FAC] when all the work, all the traveling through [GPE], all the stops by diners and in folks' living rooms and in barns in some cases-- --had all culminated in this incredible moment, a moment that was less about me than it was about the [NORP] people and the commitment that we made to each other, that we wanted a country that was true to its founding ideals, but had adapted to [DATE], an [GPE] that was big in spirit and bold in vision. And I said on that night that this was not the end, but rather, it was the beginning. Because what we understood even then was that our country had reached a crossroads. That we had a series of decisions that were going to help determine the future not just of our children, but our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. That we were living in an age in which the world had shrunk; it had become more interconnected than ever before. And that if we did not make some critical decisions now, if we stopped just kicking the can down the road, but we decided that we were actually going to seize the moment and transform our education system and finally fix our health care system and deal with our energy policy so that we were no longer subject to the whims of the spot oil market, and if we did not transform our foreign policy to recognize the visions and dreams of [CARDINAL] of people around the world who were yearning to be free--if we did not make some fundamental changes, that we might be the first generation that was passing on an [GPE] that was less hopeful, that was less generous, and that all those people who felt the American Dream slipping out of their fingers, that somehow that loss of hope would continue. And I said at the time, this is going to be an uphill climb. Now, I did not know how uphill it was going to be. None of us did. It turned out that on [TIME] we had already lost [CARDINAL] of jobs because of the financial meltdown and the recession. And it was not until [DATE] after my Inauguration that we realized we would ultimately lose [CARDINAL] jobs before any of our economic plans had a chance to take effect, the worst recession since the Great Depression. And there are families all across the country that are still suffering from the aftershocks of that. And so we had to immediately start acting. And in some cases, the actions we took were not always popular. But we knew that it was vital for us to act boldly and swiftly to address the crisis. And let us take a look at what we were able to accomplish. An economy that was shrinking by [PERCENT] has now grown for [DATE]. An economy that was shedding jobs [DATE] now has seen [CARDINAL] jobs created just in [DATE]. An auto industry that some had written off now are making profits again and have hired back all their workers. The financial system stabilized. We got the economy moving in the right direction. And along the way, we did a few other things. Along the way, we did a few other things. We decided that we did not want equal pay for equal work to be just an empty slogan, so we strengthened laws to make sure that our daughters are treated as well as our sons. We decided that in a nation as wealthy as ours, it was unacceptable for people to go bankrupt just because they got sick. And so after [DATE], we finally delivered on the promise of making sure that we had affordable, accessible health care in this country for all people. We made record investments in clean energy, record investments in basic research, and restored science to its rightful place. We made the largest Federal investment in education in our history, but we did not just put more money in. We decided we were finally going to deliver on reform and help catalyze reforms in [CARDINAL] States all across the country to make sure that schools are doing right by every single student, K through 12. And we also made sure that young people are able to afford to go to college, so we took away [MONEY] of subsidies that were going to banks and put those in the student loan system so that [CARDINAL] young people were able to go to college without taking on [MONEY]' worth of debt. We appointed a couple more women on [ORG], including the first [NORP]. We ended the law that said that you could not serve your country because of who you loved. We made the biggest infrastructure investment in this country since [PERSON] built [FAC]. Internationally, we brought [CARDINAL] 000 troops back from [GPE] and are ending combat operations. We regained momentum in [GPE] and are now in the process of transition, where we can bring our troops home. We have gone after [ORG] relentlessly and made [GPE] safer in the process. And we have restored around the world a sense of [GPE] as a responsible actor that will uphold the principles of human rights and liberty and democracy. And in between, we have dealt with pirates and-- --do you remember? Remember pirates-- --H1N1 and an oil spill and locusts? So we have been pretty busy. And I could not be prouder of our record over [DATE]. Promises were made during the campaign, and so many promises have been kept. And yet, all across [GPE], folks are still struggling. We have been able to avert the worst possible crises, but a lot of those challenges that we confronted in [DATE], those challenges are still out there. Wages and incomes have flatlined for the middle class all across [GPE]. The rates of poverty in too many communities are way too high. In too many schools, too many of our children still drop out without hope, without vision for the future. We still do not have an energy policy in this country that is equal to our potential and our greatness. And we are still vulnerable to high gas prices that are just killing families all across [GPE] right now. We still have not reformed our broken immigration system. So we have too many people living in the shadows, being exploited by workers, driving down the wages of workers as a consequence, because those employers are not subject to the rules. And families are being broken up in the process. We still have not fully transformed our economy so that we are competitive the way we need to be and are creating jobs at the pace we need and growth at the rate that we need. And so we still got so much work to do. The challenges we confronted were not the work of [DATE] or [DATE] or even [CARDINAL] term. And that is why I am going to need you. That is why, in some ways, this campaign may be even more important and more challenging than [DATE]. We have to finish what we started. We have to finish what we started, in [DATE] and beyond, and that is why I am going to need you, all in. Part of what made our campaign special was you, going out knocking on doors and organizing, some of you traveling to other [GPE] in the middle of [DATE], occasionally getting doors slammed in your faces. [PERSON] who? But that energy, that inspiration that you gave me, the commitments you made to each other about the kind of country you wanted to live in, that spirit we need now more than ever. And that is part of the reason why we decided not to have our campaign here in [GPE], [GPE], but to have it based again in [GPE]. Because I do not want a campaign that suddenly is all about the insiders, suddenly is all about the pundits and the lobbyists. And I wanted to make sure that we had a campaign that was rooted and grounded in what folks are talking about around the kitchen table and around the water coolers all across [GPE]. And that is why it is going to be so important that you are as engaged, as involved, as motivated, as you were [DATE]. Because what is at stake right now is not any particular policy; it has to do with a broader vision of where we want to take our country. We--I gave a budget address a while back, and a lot of people reported on the numbers and the debt and the deficit and why this is so important. And let me tell you, we as [NORP], we as progressives, need to be just as concerned about the debt as anybody else. Because that is how we will be able to move our vision forward--investing in education, investing in infrastructure, investing in clean energy--if we have got a government that lives within its means. So we have got to be concerned about that. But this broader budget debate that is now carrying over and will probably continue all the way until [DATE], it is also about what our vision of the country is. Are we a country that is going to continue to be able to do big things? Are we going to continue to make a commitment that every child, regardless of race or station or region, can achieve their dreams because they have got a school system that is delivering for them? Are we going to continue to be a nation that has the best infrastructure, moving products and services and people and information from place to place, because we have invested not just in roads and bridges and ports and airports, but in broadband lines and smart grids? Are we investing in the future the way previous generations invested in us? Are we going to continue to make sure that here in the [GPE] we are discovering the new great sources of energy that will help us save the planet, even as we are strengthening our economy and are putting our people back to work? Are we still dreaming big dreams in [GPE]? And are we going to continue to be a country that makes sure that our senior citizens can retire with dignity and respect and that [ORG] is going to be there for them and [ORG] is going to be there for them? And as we grapple through these problems, are we going to make sure that the burden is shared by everybody? We are going to have to make tough choices. But are we going to make sure that folks like me, who have been so blessed by this country, that we are doing our part? The other side right now, their only agenda is to provide tax cuts to folks like me. And you know what, we all like tax cuts, but-- --no, I mean, I have never met somebody who said, No, no, no. But you know what, I do not want $[MONEY], 000 in my pocket if I know that that means that [CARDINAL] seniors are going to have to pay [MONEY], [MONEY] for their [ORG] services. That is not something I want. I do not want special favors for me if it means that a whole bunch of kids are being cut out of [ORG]. See--and the reason I do not want it is not just out of a sense of charity. It is because my life is better when, as I am driving down the street and I pass by a school, I know, you know what, that school is doing a great job for those kids. And if I pass by a senior couple holding hands and I think to myself, you know what, that might be me and [PERSON] some day. And I like the fact that I live in a country where they have got some security in their golden years. I--that makes my life better. That is the kind of [GPE] that I want [PERSON] and [PERSON] to inherit. That is the kind of [GPE] I want all of your children and grandchildren inheriting. That is what this debate is about. That is what this campaign is about. That is what this election is about. So let me just close by saying this. There have been times over [DATE] where I know you all have gotten frustrated sometimes. I know all these conversations you are having. Oh, why did [PERSON] compromise with the [NORP] on that? Why did health care take so long? Where is my public option? You know? And I know that even though everybody is saying nice things, people are saying-- --I know people are also saying, you know, he is looking old. You know, he seemed so fresh and young back in [DATE]. Now, look, he is all gray and-- . You know, we have gone through some setbacks. In some cases, we have not gotten everything we wanted done as quickly as we wanted it done. You know, I am a little dinged up here and there. But I tell you what, though. The vision that brought us together in [DATE], that is undiminished in me. The confidence I have in the [NORP] people, in their decency, that is undiminished. My faith that we can make tough choices on behalf of future generations, that is undiminished. My belief in you has not lessened. So when you think back to [DATE], I want you to do so not with complacency, not with full satisfaction, but I want it to motivate you. Do not let people tell you that we cannot bring about change. We have already brought about change. And we have more work to do. And if you are with me, if you are all in, if you are willing to knock on doors and call your friends and call your neighbors and keep at it, even when the journey is tough, I have no doubt that we will get to where we set out to go [DATE], and we will deliver the kind of [GPE] that we want to our children. God bless you, and God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteeluncheondenver", "text": "Thank you very much. Governor, I am very grateful for what you said and grateful for what you are doing. It is hard enough to be a Governor; even if you have been doing it as long as [PERSON] hasit still requires some effort. And to do that and still be willing to travel around the country and represent [ORG] and deal with the challenges we have had to face in [DATE] takes somebody with a heart of gold, and a steel backside to be on the plane all the time, and a pretty tough skin to take some of the slings and arrows that they fling at you. And I do not think we could have had a better leader for our party than [PERSON] in [DATE]. And I am very grateful to you. Thank you, Mrs. [PERSON], for being here and for what you said. [PERSON] and I had a good talk at lunch about the kind of the afterglow of the experience we had in bringing the G- 8 conference here [DATE]. When I saw [PERSON], I told her that for the rest of my life every time I saw her I would imagine her riding into the arena on that beautiful horse. I was almost willing to take odds she would have ridden in here on that horse [DATE]. It was wonderful. But it was a great experience for us. And it was a great thing for me to be able to show that part of [GPE] to the other world leaders and to the rather vast retinue that came with them from all over the world. And I can tell you, they were just fascinated because I was kind of carping at lunch I go a lot of places, but very often I might as well just be moving around from Federal office building to Federal office building in [GPE]. [PERSON] is hiding her head. You know, my staff's idea of a good foreign trip is: I get off the airplane; I get in a limousine; I go to a government office building; I talk to [CARDINAL] people over a cup of coffee; I go get briefed for [TIME]; I go to a dinner; I sleep a little bit and turn around and come home. And it does not really matter what country I am in. I am always ragging them about that. But you were able to show all these people something really special about [GPE], about the West, and about the diversity and texture of [GPE]. And that is important because we have the same problems in dealing with each other around the world as sometimes we do in [GPE]. That is, the harder that you work and the less interpersonal time you have, the more likely you are to be driven by whatever the difference of the moment is being exaggerated by people who either work for you or work for them or write about it in the political press, and you wind up drifting apart. And so and sometimes unnecessarily. So the fact that I mean, you really did further the interest of [GPE] in building a more cooperative, peaceful world simply by letting them see real people living real lives in an interesting and, for them, a novel context. So I thank you for that. [PERSON] said [CARDINAL] other thing that I want to reiterate. I want you to know that I thank you for being here, and you have to understand that there is a significant connection between your presence here and what happens in [GPE] and what has happened in [GPE] for [DATE]. I do not think anyone would dispute the proposition that this country is in better shape than it was in [DATE]. And in [DATE] when I ran for [SPEAKER], I wanted to take our country in a new direction based on our oldest values of work and family and opportunity and responsibility, community and world leadership, the things that [GPE] has stood for throughout [DATE], and most of it for most of our existence. But it was obvious that we needed, among other things, a different notion of Government that the arguments that I read as a Governor and every Governor I knew, including yours, had the same reaction. We'd read in the paper [DATE], wherever we lived out here in the hinterland, about some fight they were having in [GPE]. And it looked to me like they were having a fight about whether the Government should try to do everything when we were broke and could not , or whether the Government should do nothing and just sit on the sidelines because Government was the source of all of our ills. Where we lived and worked and the people we worked with, we did not think either one of those things was true. So the first thing I did was, I went there with a determination to try to get decisionmakers in [GPE] to rethink the notion of Government and the role of Government in moving [GPE] forward and in bringing [GPE] together. And I believe that the role of Government is to give people the tools they need and establish the conditions so they can make the most of their own lives. And therefore, I think we should do those things which promote both opportunity and responsibility among citizens. We should do those things which bring us together, across the lines that divide us, into one [GPE]. And we should do the things that are necessary to maintain our leadership for peace and prosperity and freedom in the world, because all those things are necessary if we are going to have [DATE] which can be, and I believe will be, the best time in all of human history for the people of our country and hopefully for people around the world. Now, there are differences between the parties. When I became [SPEAKER], my economic policy was unanimously opposed by the other party in [ORG] unanimously. Not a single [CARDINAL] of them voted for my economic plan in [DATE]. And they said it would be the ruination of [GPE]; it would deepen the recession; it would explode the deficit. Well, [DATE] that plan has produced [MONEY] worth of deficit reduction. The deficit is [PERCENT] smaller than it was when I took office [PERCENT]. That is before it is very important you understand it that is before the bipartisan balanced budget agreement kicks in. [CARDINAL] reason we were able to have a bipartisan balanced budget and agree on how to do it is, it is not so hard once [PERCENT] of the heavy lifting is behind you. And I think it is important to emphasize that. The second thing that we were able to do is to develop a national crime policy. And again, the leaders of the other party opposed my crime policy. I sometimes get tickled when I read in the paper, they talk about how the [SPEAKER] adopted [NORP] positions on crime. I said, Hello? Who are these people? Where were they? They fought bitterly bitterly. Now, it is no secret; I have got a good personal relationship with Senator [PERSON] and a fair and a high estimation of him. I awarded him the Medal of Freedom. I think he is a remarkable fellow. The angriest I ever heard him on the floor of the [ORG] was when he was unsuccessful in filibustering the crime bill. He tried to kill it. The [ORG] was against it, said I was going to take everybody's guns away. And they said, If you put [CARDINAL] police on the streets it would not make a lick of difference just as sort of a boondoggle. They attacked us for being for after-school programs for kids and preventive programs to keep kids out of trouble in the first place. But our crime bill was basically written out of the experience of police officers and prosecutors and community leaders who were in communities where they were already lowering the crime rate by doing what was in our bill. So we passed the bill with [CARDINAL] police officers and with tougher punishment where appropriate, but with prevention measures and with the assault weapons ban. And [DATE], we have had [DATE] of steeply dropping crime, and the murder rate has dropped [PERCENT] in [DATE] in this country. Now, you know here in [GPE] you have just been through it the crime rate is still too high, and there is still too much violence in this country. But we are going in the right direction. And that happened because of a political choice the [NORP] people made, and they knew how to make it in part because they heard the messages of the competing candidates. There is a direct connection between your presence here and that decision. And we had a huge fight about it. In welfare, the same thing is true. I did not mind letting the [GPE] set the level of assistance to people on welfare because they had been, in effect, doing that for [DATE] anyway. Before I ever signed the welfare reform law, there was a difference of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] between what a family on welfare could get in the State where the benefits were the lowest and the State where the benefits were the highest [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. I do not want to overexaggerate3 1/2 to [CARDINAL]. I just redid the math in my head. And I had no problem in requiring people who are on welfare who are able-bodied and able-minded to go to work. I thought that was important, because we were talking around our table [CARDINAL] the welfare caseload was becoming people who were just permanently on welfare, almost, and sometimes intergenerationally. And that has nothing to do with compassion. You are not being compassionate when you leave people in a position of dependency when they do not have to be there. On the other hand, it is important, it seemed to me, when you require people who can work to work, not to ask them to hurt their children in doing it. After all, the biggest problem working families have [DATE], many working families, is balancing the demand of taking care of their kids and taking care of their job. And I hear people even with very comfortable income levels, when they are honest, say they feel conflicts between their obligations to their children and their obligations at work. And I think that it is not an exaggeration to say the most important job that any society has, ever, is raising good, strong, ethical children. That is society's most important job. So why should we expect people on welfare to sacrifice the most important job of society to do what is the most important job, arguably, in the short run to give them the self-respect and the independence they need to contribute to our common welfare? So I vetoed [CARDINAL] bills because they took away medical care and nutrition for kids and they did not give enough money for child care and because I wanted more money to put people to work in high unemployment areas. Once we resolved those things, I signed that bill. And I think it is a good thing. And the results are clear: We had the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, [CARDINAL] fewer people on welfare than [DATE] I became [SPEAKER]. So we are moving in the right direction. The environment: The air is cleaner, the water is purer, the food supply is safer, and there are fewer toxic waste dumps. And we proved you could grow the economy and improve the environment at the same time. Now we have to prove we can do that with greenhouse gas emissions to deal with the climate change issue. And it will be tougher, but it clearly can be done clearly. There is no question, if you just look at the evidence, that we can do it. So what I want you to know is that every time you see something like that that is good, that is a product of a choice because we had a fight about all those issues. We had an honest debate, a partisan debate about these issues. In [DATE] we passed a balanced budget agreement that had overwhelming bipartisan support, but there were elements that our side brought to it. We said, okay, we want to balance the budget, and we do not mind giving families the tax cut; we do not mind giving businesses the tax cut if we invest properly in giving all [NORP] access to college we want tax breaks for that; we want to spend some money to provide health insurance coverage to the children of working families who do not have it. We have got enough money for [CARDINAL] more kids to get health insurance in working families with low incomes. That is [CARDINAL] the uninsured kids in the country. And we got the biggest new investment in education since [DATE]. That was because of choices that we made in [GPE] that the people who were there would not have been able to make if you had not helped us get there. There is a direct connection between your presence here and the things that are in that budget. And just [DATE] let me just close with this I had [DATE] it was a killer of [DATE]. And what you saw probably in the headlines was the work we were doing on [GPE], but let me tell you what else went on [DATE]. We signed a bill that we worked on for [DATE] to overhaul the way [ORG] regulates medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and the foodstuffs they regulate [DATE]. It passed by voice vote everybody. But underneath that there were these incredible conflicts and rubbing up against and debates and everything. And the way it came out, I believe the public interest is dramatically advanced, because if you have got a safe drug or if you have got a safe medical device, for goodness sakes, you want it on the market as quick as possible. So we had to strike all those balances. Well, the public interest side of that a lot of that work over [DATE] came from people that you helped to elect and from attitudes that you helped to advance. I signed a bill dramatically overhauling the foster care and adoption procedures and clearing away a lot of the obstacles to quicker adoption, even for children that have serious health problems. And my wife has worked on these subjects for [DATE]. I have rarely seen her as happy as she was [DATE]. And all these advocates from all over the country came in, and I met a family that had adopted [CARDINAL] children, including [CARDINAL] of them who were wheelchair-bound. And to see these people who care about these kids you know, [DATE] we put in a [MONEY] [MONEY] tax credit for adoption. But you need to know we all talk about how we believe in family values there are [CARDINAL] of kids out there that need a home that are trapped in a foster care system. And [CARDINAL] of my staff members after it was over came up to me with tears in his eyes the guy has nothing to do with the human services area he came up to me, and he had tears in his eyes and said, I just want you to know that I spent [DATE] of my childhood in [CARDINAL] foster home after another. And this is going to change entire lives for people. And then I went to [GPE], [GPE], to the [ORG] plant and saw what that company is doing to take hardcore welfare recipients and put them through training programs and guarantee them jobs. And a lot of these women have been severely beaten by their spouses or partners, have no money, are high school dropouts. [ORG] provides housing, a [DATE] training program, a [DATE] pre-job program, and a guaranteed job for anybody who can finish. And I saw people speaking they had [CARDINAL] of these women speaking. If you'd been told that [DATE] they were on welfare and had less than a high school education, you would not have believed it. You would have thought they were members of [ORG]. And I expect they both could be if they put themselves up for election now. We announced you saw [DATE], we announced that we are going to have the first permanent peace talks between [GPE] and [GPE], in the [CARDINAL]-party context we proposed, since the end of the Korean war. We are working through a very difficult situation in [GPE] and, I think, in an appropriate way. And I know those things have dominated the news. But if you think about what happened in [GPE] for [NORP] [DATE], there were a couple of times when all of us just looked at each other and said, You know, this is what we got in public life to do. This is what makes all the other stuff worth it. And what I want you to understand is, the decisions that are made and the way they are made are made by real human beings who have real views and real convictions, in conflict with other real human beings who also have honest views. You know, I had a long talk with Senator [PERSON] [DATE]. I like Senator [PERSON]. You know, we lived across the river from each other in our former lives, and it is nice having the [ORG] Majority Leader without an accent. We like each other. We understand each other. I had to give him [QUANTITY] of barbecue when [GPE] beat [GPE] in football. I like him. And he would tell you the same thing. We really look at the world differently. We see things differently. We have honest differences of opinion. And what [PERSON] told you is true: That is what is kept this country going for [DATE]. I believe history will record that at this moment in time our views were right and that we prepared the world prepared [GPE] for a totally new world. But you have got to know that you helped to make it possible. And you should never let that sort of fashionable rhetoric demeaning the whole act of contributing to your democracy so people who believe what you do can hold up their side that is there is something wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with that. [TIME] when you go home, you think about being at this lunch; you think about those adopted kids; you think about the people who are going to get drugs that will keep them alive; you think about those women that can now be going into the work force because their kids do have food and medicine and child care; you think about the doors of college being opened to everybody for the first time in the history of this country. You think about all that and be proud. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdinnerforgovernormelcarnahan", "text": "AboutSearch Well, thank you very much. Let me begin by thanking [PERSON] and [PERSON] for having us into this magnificent, beautiful place, for the [NORP] again and specifically for [PERSON]; and for being such good friends and for being willing to be called [PERSON] and [PERSON] and other names. I am sure there is a reward for you in heaven for enduring those slings and arrows. I want to thank the other Senators who have come here to express their support for you. I see Senator [PERSON] back there, Senator [PERSON], and Senator [PERSON]. I think Senator [PERSON] is here. There he is. And Senator [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON] were here. I do not know if they are still here or not. But this is quite an outstanding turnout of your prospective colleagues. I also want all of you to know that I have a different take on this than everybody this race than everybody here who is not from [GPE], because [PERSON] and [PERSON] have been friends of mine for along time. [PERSON] has worked with me, and their children I have had a chance to know. I want you to know that you did a good thing [TIME], contributing to his campaign, because he was a great Governor and because he is a good man and a good friend and because he will be a good Senator. I am for him in part because when only my mother thought I could be elected President in [DATE] and my wife, as she never lets me forget [PERSON] was a Lieutenant Governor involved in a very difficult primary for Governor. He had all he could say grace over, and he still endorsed me for President in the [GPE] primary. It was a brave and good thing to do, and I will never forget it. And I was the Governor of [GPE]. [GPE] is my neighbor. I was raised idolizing [PERSON]. When I was a young man here in the [ORG], I worked for Senator [PERSON] and got to watch [PERSON] up close. And I may be the only person here who is actually known Senator [PERSON] for [DATE], besides [PERSON]. We served together as attorney general and as Governor, and we always had a very cordial, personal relationship. But I can tell you that he actually believes all those things that the [NORP] say. And I say that not to make you laugh but to say, you know, one of the things I do not like in a lot of these campaigns is, we get into all this name-calling and demonization. We act like, you know, what is really bad about our opponents is, they are doing these bad things, and they do not really believe them. That is not true about him. We can laugh about this, but that is what they think about us. They think we are always playing to some crowd or another. And I think it is important to point out that most of us on both sides actually believe in what we are doing. And that is what makes the political system work. It is what gives the political system integrity. The main reason that I want to see campaign finance reform, since I am not a candidate for anything anymore, and the main reason I really respect [PERSON] because, you know, if we have campaign finance reform, it'll cost him a little less money, but then he will have to open his home and have [TIME] where we actually debate the issues, instead of hustle you for money. But the major reason we need to reform the campaign finance system, in my judgment, is that it is almost all the money goes to voter communication, and it is wrong to have unequal levels of voter communication. The people need to hear a full debate on both sides and have a full ability to evaluate the personalities of candidates on all sides in order to make good decisions. And the second main reason we need it is that the people in office and the people who want to get in office have to spend too much time raising money, and they are exhausted all the time, and they do not have enough time to read and think and talk to other people. I would say the third reason you need it is the reason all the press says, which is, you know, the corrupting influence of big money. The truth is that [PERCENT] of the time [PERCENT] of the time the people in both parties in the [ORG] and in the [ORG] vote their convictions. And way over [PERCENT] of the time the people that give you money never ask you for anything, except to keep in touch with them and discuss the issues and talk about things and listen to them if they have got something on their minds. Anyway, to get back to the point I was making, I know both these men. And I do not have to demonize [PERSON]. When we were young men together, we worked as attorney general together; we worked as Governor. I had a very cordial relationship with him. But he believes in how he is voted in the [ORG], and I do not . And we should stop pretending that it does not make any difference who wins, or that it is all some game dominated by who gives money and all that. That is not true. There are [CARDINAL] great philosophical differences of opinion [DATE], battling their way through [GPE]. They won in the elections of [DATE]. We won when we beat the contract on [GPE]. The people ratified our decision in [DATE]. We got together briefly in the welfare reform bill and in the Balanced Budget Act of [DATE]. Then our approach was ratified in the [DATE] election. And then we won again when I vetoed their huge tax bill in [DATE], which would have undermined our ability to save [ORG] and [ORG], balance the budget, pay off the debt, and keep investing in our future. But we have now had we have got an ongoing debate here about what kind of country we are going to be, what our responsibilities to each other are, and where we are going. Now, I know this man very well, [PERSON]. I know him very well. We worked together for [DATE]. I went to [GPE] more than any other State when we were promoting welfare reform because he did the best job of any Governor in [GPE] in requiring people who were able-bodied to get training and to go into the workplace and getting big businesses to help him, but also caring about the welfare of poor people, to make sure that the children had health care and the people had a decent place to live and the child care was there and the transportation was there. He did it right. And if he is in the [ORG], he will do it right. This is a very important thing. I can also tell you that for [NORP], because we believe in activist Government, it is very important that we keep a certain number of innovative Governors coming into [ORG] all the time, because they understand how this stuff works. And it is important that you have people from our part of the country elected to the [ORG], so that we can defend it when we have to take tough votes on sensible gun safety measures, for example. It is not a hard vote for people who have no significant rural voters, no significant percentage for getting the [ORG] mailings all the time. It will be a hard vote for him. And he will take it, and he will do the right thing, but then he will know how to defend it, which is very, very important. So all these [ORG] races are very important [DATE]. All these [ORG] races are important. But I want those of you who do not know [PERSON] to know you have an extraordinary opportunity here. I know this guy. He is a good man. He is a great friend. He was there with me when I was practically all alone and running fifth in the polls in [GPE]. You want somebody that will stay hitched in the tough times and take a decision when it is not selfevidently the right thing to do. He has been a fabulous Governor, and you heard him reel off the issues. I just want you to know this is a huge deal. These judicial votes [DATE] were just [CARDINAL] example. Senator [PERSON] voted to kill the [NORP] [ORG] judge in [GPE], [PERSON], and I believe did not fairly represent his position as a judge on criminal justice issues. But there is an honest division here. You do not have to hate anybody to take the other one's part. But of all the races we have got going where we are trying to elect a new person to the [ORG], this guy has a unique ability to make a contribution to the [ORG], to the policies and the politics of the [ORG], that no one else does. You did a good thing in coming here. I hope you will ask other people to give to his campaign. I think he is going to win, and all of us need to do whatever we can to help him. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksduringmeetingwithdepartmentdefenseleadership", "text": "AboutSearch Well, happy New Year, everybody. Let me begin by thanking [PERSON], our Secretary of [ORG]; General [PERSON], Vice Chair [PERSON], and all of our commanders here. The purpose of this meeting, something I do on a regular basis, is to allow me to hear directly from those who are charged with the most solemn responsibility of maintaining the finest fighting force that the world has ever known and keeping the [NORP] people safe. It is in these meetings that we have been able to set broad strategy, identify areas where we have to improve, address the health of the force. And I can say to the [NORP] people that they are extraordinarily lucky and I am extraordinarily lucky to be served by such extraordinary patriots. This will be my last meeting with them. And so part of my goal here is just to say thank you to them and let them know how much I appreciate the counsel, the advice, the leadership that they have consistently shown throughout my time in office. But in addition to saying thank you, I will get their views on the fact that we still have a lot of active threats around the world and we still have men and women in harm's way around the world who are busy protecting our homeland and our vital interests and our allies. And we have got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there is continuity, and that any issues that still remain and obviously, we still have major fights against [ORG] in [GPE] and in [GPE]; [GPE] is still active that in all of these areas we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next President will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me. So it has been, as I have said repeatedly, one of the greatest honors and privileges of being President is serving as Commander in Chief to such outstanding people. And I could not have done it without all of you. And I know that my optimism about [GPE] going forward is in part because we have such an amazing military, not only one that knows how to fight, but also knows how to uphold the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the [NORP] military. So I just want to say thank you to all of you. And with that, we have got to do some work. All right? Thank you so much. I appreciate it.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania", "text": "Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for the warm welcome. If I talk too long, it is going to be even warmer. I really appreciate the chance to come to [FAC]. I am glad to see it in action. More importantly, I was glad to see the people working here, glad to meet them, glad to get to know them. I appreciate their strong dedication to safety. I appreciate their dedication to the consumers you serve. This plant serves [CARDINAL] homes in the area, and it does so in a way that does not require us to pollute the air. It is a perfect example of how we can grow our economy and protect our environment at the same time. And so thanks for receiving me. I am honored to be here. I thank [PERSON] for introducing me, and thanks for coming over from [GPE]. Appreciate you being here. I want to thank [PERSON]. I want to thank [PERSON]. Thank you for having me, [PERSON]. I want to thank the mayor, [PERSON], of [GPE]. Thanks for coming, Madam Mayor. I appreciate you being here. I want to thank all the folks from the local government sorry about clogging the neighborhoods coming through, but thanks. Appreciate you letting me come by. I want to talk about how [GPE] can continue to be the economic leader of the world. First of all, I think it is important that we are the economic leader of the world, because when you are the leader, it helps the folks who live in your country. See, it matters if we are on the cutting edge of change. It matters to people working [DATE] in [GPE] if we are creating strong economic growth. [DATE], we are creating strong economic growth. I mean, this economy of ours is moving forward with a full head of steam [DATE] in a row of uninterrupted growth. Our economy grew faster than any other major industrialized nation in the world. We added [CARDINAL] new jobs since [DATE]. The national unemployment rate is [PERCENT]. Productivity is high, and that is important. A productive society will yield a higher standard of living for our people. [DATE] compensation grew at an [DATE] rate of [PERCENT] in [DATE]. Our workers are taking bigger home bigger paychecks. The standard of living is on the rise. After-tax income is up. Things are good. And the fundamental question is, can you keep them that way, see? And there is a lot of competition in the world that creates some uncertainty and anxiety amongst our people. And the temptation for some is to say, Well, we cannot compete anymore so let us protect ourselves and let us withdraw; let us become isolationists. I think that would be a wrong approach by our country. See, we ought not to fear the future; we ought to shape the future. We ought to be confident in our ability to be able to compete and to remain the most innovative country in the world. And so here are some ideas. First, if we want to be the economic leader in the world so our people can prosper, we need to keep taxes low. We need to be able to be a society that says, you get to earn more of that which you earn. As you might recall, we went through a pretty tough time in this country over [DATE]. We had a recession, corporate scandals, a stock market correction, a attack on our country. We went to war to defend ourselves; we have had high energy prices; and we had natural disasters. And yet this economy of ours is strong. And I believe the reason why is, is because of the tax cuts we passed in [GPE], [GPE]. We believe that if you have more money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows. And so [CARDINAL] way to make sure that we are the economic leader in the world is to make sure the tax cuts we passed are permanent. Now, people say, Well, if you make the tax cuts permanent, you cannot balance the budget. Well, let me talk a little bit about how [GPE] works. I have been there long enough to be able to give you an accurate report. Do not believe it when they say they are going to raise your taxes to balance the budget. They are going to raise your taxes and figure out new ways to spend the money. The best way to balance the budget is to keep progrowth economic policies in place. And, by the way, [DATE], because our economy was growing, we generated [MONEY] more for the [ORG] than we thought. And [DATE], because of the economy growing strong, we are generating better rates than we did [DATE]. And so the best way to balance the budget is to keep growing the economy so we collect more tax revenues and be wise about spending your money. See, in [GPE], everything sounds good there; every program sounds fantastic. But Government, in order to be wise about spending your money, has got to learn to set priorities. And my priority is this: So long as we have a soldier in harm's way, he or she will have what it takes to achieve victory and secure [GPE]. We are on our way to cutting the deficit in [CARDINAL] by [DATE]. [ORG] is now debating a supplemental bill. It is money to help fund our troops in [GPE], as well as helping the victims in Katrina. And I have made it very clear that I intend to participate with them in keeping the spending down. And if they exceed the [MONEY] request, plus monies for avian flu, I am going to veto the bill. See, that is [CARDINAL] way you keep fiscal discipline in [GPE], [GPE]. We will be competitive if we keep taxes low and be wise about how we spend your money. We will be competitive, by the way, if we are smart about improving education for our people. See, this is a global economy, whether people like it or not. And the jobs of [DATE] will be either here in [GPE] or wherever the workforce is trained to fill those jobs. And therefore, it is important for us to make sure we educate our children early and emphasize math and science so our kids have got the skills necessary to fill those jobs. We changed how we view public education in [GPE]. We passed the No Child Left Behind Act, see. It basically said, we are going to make sure we fulfill our commitment to Title I students, but we are starting to ask some questions questions that I am sure are asked at this plant: Are you meeting objectives, for example? If you set a goal, are you meeting those goals? And so we set some goals: How about every child learning to read at grade level by the third grade? That did not seem like an unrealistic goal to me. As a matter of fact, it was a necessary goal. And then we said to the [GPE], you measure. We are going to get you some money, but you measure to show us whether or not we are meeting the goal. And if you are not meeting the goal, figure out why. See, you cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And so the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, we are going to diagnose problems early and solve them, before it is too late. This business about shuffling kids through the school through our schools, based upon age, did not work. It was not fair. It was not right. And so the No Child Left Behind Act says, we are going to measure early, and we are going to help children who have fallen behind in reading early, and then we are going to extend that to math. See, one of the interesting things is because we measure, we know that we are doing fine in math in the eighth grade. But children get to high school relative to other countries, we are not doing fine in math. And we better do something about it now if we want to be the economic leader of the world. So we have got a plan to, [CARDINAL], make sure the same standards applied to reading for early grades are applied to math. If we measure in the eighth grade or ninth grade and you are falling behind, you are going to get extra help. Secondly, advanced placement programs work. I bet I am looking at some folks out here who took AP when they were in high school. [ORG] means high standards. But we do not have enough teachers around the country to teach AP, so we have got a plan to train [CARDINAL] Advanced Placement teachers to keep raising those standards. We want to have [CARDINAL] 000 adjunct professors in our classrooms in high school and junior sometimes it is not cool to be involved with science and yet it is cool. And we need people who are on the frontlines of science explaining that. I went to a school in [GPE] [DATE], and there was a [ORG] scientist there, explaining to junior high kids why the sciences matter and why it is fun to be in science. We are going to make sure our Pell grants which, by the way, have expanded by [CARDINAL] kids since I have been the [INTERVIEWED] continue to have incentives in there for children to take rigorous academics coming out of high school and [DATE] of college, and then if they maintain a [CARDINAL] average or are taking math, science, or critical language, there is [MONEY] [MONEY] on top of their Pell grant. In other words, this is an effort to make sure that we have a workforce that can compete in a global economy so we remain the economic leader of the world. I want to talk about energy, see. If we do not get it right in energy, we can have the most educated workforce in the world, but we are not going to be able to compete. We can have the lowest taxes in the world, the least regulations, the fewest lawsuits, but if we have not done something about our energy situation, we are not going to be able to compete in the world. And so that is why I have come to this important powerplant, to talk about how [GPE] can have a diversified energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of oil and more dependent on renewable sources of energy. Now, one of the things I want to start off by telling the telling you all, and I hope others are listening, is that over [DATE], our economy has grown [CARDINAL] times faster than our energy consumption. Is not that interesting statistics? In other words, we are becoming more technologically advanced. And during that same period of time, we created [CARDINAL] jobs while cutting air pollution by [PERCENT]. So what I believe the [NORP] people should understand is that we can put policies in place that encourage economic growth so you have got a better standard of living and, at the same time, become less dependent on energy from overseas and protect the environment. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing we got to do is understand that we have got to change our driving habits over time. You have seen the price of gasoline going up. [CARDINAL] of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is because demand for oil is increasing in places like [GPE] and [GPE], and the supply for oil is not meeting that demand. And the key ingredient for gasoline is crude oil. So when the [NORP] economy is growing or the [NORP] economy is growing, and that demand is going up, so is your price at the pump. [CARDINAL] way to make sure the price at the pump does not go up as global demand increases for hydrocarbons is to figure out how to drive our cars with different kinds of fuels, such as ethanol. [CARDINAL] of the really interesting developments that is taking place now in [GPE] is the use of corn-based ethanol pretty cool deal, is not it, for the [INTERVIEWED] to be able to say, you know, we are growing a lot of corn and we are less dependent on foreign sources of oil. It is coming particularly in the Midwest right now, there is a lot of ethanol pumps and plants being developed there to manufacture ethanol from corn. We have got to do more, though, if we are going to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, when it comes to ethanol. And so we are spending a lot of your money to develop technologies that will enable us to be able to manufacture ethanol from wood chips or switchgrass. Somebody said, What is switchgrass? I said, Well, it is grass that looks like a switch that grows in dry country. In other words, there is all kinds of opportunities to manufacture ethanol, and we are exploring ways to do so. [GPE] has always been on the leading edge of technology and research and development, and here is an area where we have got to stay on the leading edge of change. Another way to help reduce our use of gasoline is through hybrid vehicles. They are coming; they are coming on the market. As a matter of fact, the energy bill I signed actually will pay you give you a tax credit if you buy a hybrid. We are trying to stimulate demand through the Tax Code. It makes sense. But there is going to be an additional breakthrough or additional breakthroughs when it comes to hybrid vehicles, starting with the development of a battery that will enable you to drive your first [QUANTITY] on electricity. And [ORG] is very much involved in this research. We are spending your money, again, on research to help fund breakthroughs for battery technologies that will enable you to drive a plug-in hybrid battery. And, oh, by the way, on ethanol, just [CARDINAL] thing I forgot to tell you is that there are [CARDINAL] flex-fuel vehicles on the road [DATE]. Flex-fuel means you can either have gasoline or ethanol or a combination of the [CARDINAL]. You have probably got one and you do not even know it. The technology the barrier to change is not the automobile; it is the ability to make the fuel in quantities economic quantities so we can get them to you at the pump. And same with hybrid batteries; they are coming. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles with new batteries, they are coming your way. And one of the reasons why is because the Government has entered into research partnerships with the private sector to accelerate these technologies, all aimed at making us less dependent on oil. A third way to help this country remain an economic leader when it comes to the cars you drive is hydrogen. We spend [MONEY] of research to bring hydrogen to the marketplace. [CARDINAL] fellow reminded me, wisely, it costs it takes quite a bit of power to make hydrogen. An interesting way to make hydrogen on an economic basis would be through nuclear power, see. But we are spending money and time and effort, all aimed at making sure that the automobiles of the future will require less crude oil. And we are close to some significant breakthroughs. It is going to take time to move away from the hydrocarbon economy to the hydrogen economy, and in the meantime, it seems like it makes sense to me to do something about the refinery capacity of [GPE]. Like, if you are worried about the price of gasoline you do not like it when your price got [MONEY] and I do not blame you you might want to ask the question, how come the Government is not working hard to expand refinery capacity so that there is more gasoline? If you have more gasoline on the market relative to demand, guess what it takes the pressure off price. We have not built a new refinery in [GPE] since [DATE]. The regulatory burden is a lot. You are kind of used to that here in this industry. And so we got to cut through all that business. If we are serious about helping our consumers and getting more gasoline to the market, we got to have regulatory relief. I suggested to [ORG] that we put new refineries on abandoned military facilities. It seemed to make sense to me. And so we need to be wise about these policies so that we can say to the [NORP] people, we are on our way out of the hydrocarbon era. But in the meantime, let us be thoughtful of the consumers here in [GPE]. We are also going to need a lot of electricity in the future. Electricity demand is projected to increase by [PERCENT] over [DATE]. That is a lot. And we better be wise about how we implement a strategy to meet that demand; otherwise, we are not going to be the economic leader; otherwise, our people are not going to be having the good jobs that we want them to have; otherwise, your children and my children, our grandchildren are not going to have the bright, hopeful [GPE] that we want for them. Now, [CARDINAL] of the things that people have got to understand is that we get our we generate our electricity from [CARDINAL] sources: coal it is [PERCENT]; nuclear power [PERCENT]; natural gas [PERCENT]; and then other renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power. And that is the mix; that is the energy mix. Coal is by far the most abundant and affordable energy resource. We got [DATE] at current rates of consumption. It is a valuable asset for [GPE]. The problem is, coal is not when you burn it, it is not clean. It does not meet our standards. It is not it does not enable us to say, you can grow your economy and, at the same time, protect the environment like we want. And so we are developing clean coal technology. We are spending [MONEY] in a [DATE] period to be able to say to the [NORP] people that we are using the money wisely to determine whether or not we can have [CARDINAL]-emissions coal-fired powerplants. It is in our interests that we do that. It makes sense. [DATE], under [ORG], we think we will build the first powerplant to run on coal and remove virtually all pollutants. Natural gas is an important commodity. By the way, we can explore for natural gas in environmentally friendly ways. And we ought to be exploring for natural gas in the [ORG], as well as off the gulf coast of [GPE]. Here is another interesting way to help make sure there is enough natural gas for this economy to grow by the way, natural gas, as you know, is not just used for power. It is used for fertilizers, a variety of uses. You can liquefy natural gas; you can put it in a ship, and you can send it long distances and still have an economic product. And there are places in this world where there is a lot of natural gas a lot. And they are building liquefied production facilities. And they put them on these ships but we do not have any places to off-load it in [GPE]. We got some, but not enough. If we are really interested in diversifying our energy sources and making sure the [NORP] people have got enough energy to watch this economy grow, we have got to have LNG sites to offload the gas from abroad. And so what we have done is, I signed a new bill, energy bill, that clarifies [ORG] authority to license new sites, that reduces the bureaucratic obstacles to opening up the terminals and streamlines the development. It is in your interest that we enable liquefied natural gas to come into our country so that we can help take the burden off some of the pricing pressures that we are inevitably going to feel with demand going up and not enough electricity supply. Thirdly, [PERCENT] of the continental [GPE] is highly suitable for the construction of wind turbines. And this is a really interesting opportunity for the country they ought to put [CARDINAL] big one in [GPE], [GPE]. They say the experts tell me that this area alone has the potential to supply [PERCENT] of our Nation's electricity. I think that is an interesting opportunity. I do not know if it is true or not, but it is certainly worth trying to find out, in order to make sure this country has got a bright future. And so we got [MONEY] for wind energy research. And the goal is to expand the use and lower the cost of wind turbine technology. In other words, we are constantly researching and looking. I do not know if you know this or not, but [ORG] does spend money on research in a variety of fronts, and it should. And I intend to double the basic the budget for basic research over [DATE]. The iPod like, I like to ride my mountain bike and plug in the iPod. The technology for the iPod came as a result of [ORG] research. The Internet came about because of defense money research. So we are spending money on research. The reason I keep repeating that is not only is it going to help us diversify our energy sources and make us competitive in the world, but it also helps make sure [GPE] is always on the leading edge of technological change. Solar energy the dream in solar energy is to develop technology so that someday your house is like a little generating plant, and if you do not use the power, you feed it back into the grid. It is possible, but it is not going to be possible if we do not spend money on research and development. So we are spending [MONEY] to combine Government money with private research money in solar technologies to see if we cannot help foster technologies that will be able to capture the sun, feed it into your house, generate enough electricity, and if you have got a little excess, feed it back into the grid. I think that is a pretty interesting idea, and it is certainly one worth exploring. Finally, I want to talk about nuclear power a subject you all are very familiar with. It is a really important way to meet our goals, which is to have abundant, affordable, clean, and safe sources of energy. The important thing for the [NORP] people to understand is this concept: [CARDINAL], nuclear power is abundant and affordable. In other words, you have nuclear powerplants, you can say, we have got an abundant amount of electricity. And once you get the plant up and running, the operating costs of these plants are significantly lower than other forms of electricity plants, which means the energy is affordable. As I mentioned, nuclear power it is the second leading source of electricity here. We have [CARDINAL] nuclear powerplants that operate in [CARDINAL] [GPE]. Now, we have not built one in a long period of time. People in our country are rightly concerned about greenhouse gases and the environment, and I can understand why; I am too. As a matter of fact, I try to tell people, let us quit the debate about whether greenhouse gases are caused by mankind or by natural causes; let us just focus on technologies that deal with the issue. Nuclear power will help us deal with the issue of greenhouse gases. Without nuclear energy, carbon dioxide emissions would have been [PERCENT] greater in the electricity industry in [DATE]. Without nuclear power, we would have had [QUANTITY] a year of carbon dioxide, and that is nearly equal to the [DATE] emissions from [CARDINAL] passenger cars. Nuclear power helps us protect the environment. And nuclear power is safe. It is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design. It is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear powerplants are incredibly skilled people who know what they are doing. For the sake of economic security and national security, [GPE] must aggressively move forward with the construction of nuclear power-plants. Other nations are. Interestingly enough, [GPE] has built [CARDINAL] plants since [DATE] and now gets [PERCENT] of its electricity from nuclear power. I think that is an interesting statistic, is not it? [GPE] has not ordered a plant since [DATE], and yet [GPE] has not only ordered them, they built [CARDINAL] plants. And [PERCENT] of their electricity comes from nuclear power. They do not have to worry about natural gas coming from somewhere else. They worry about it, but they do not have to worry about it to the extent that we do. [GPE] has [CARDINAL] nuclear plants in operation, and they got plan to build [CARDINAL] more over [DATE]. They understand that in order to be an aggressive nation, an economic nation that is flourishing so their people can benefit, they better do something about their sources of electricity. They see it. [GPE] I just came from [GPE] they are going to build some nuclear powerplants. To maintain our economic leadership, we got to do it again. And so here is the strategy. First, in the energy bill I signed in [DATE], there are loan guarantees, production tax credits, [ORG] risk insurance for the builders of new plants. In other words, we said, this is an industry that had not got much going since [DATE]. It is an overregulated industry. It is highly risky because of the regulations to try to build a plant. People do not know this, but you get yourself a design for a nuclear powerplant; you start spending money for plans and engineering plans and everything; you get building; and all of the sudden, somebody can shut you down. And that makes it awfully difficult to take risk, if a lawsuit can cause you to spend enormous sums of money and have no productive use of the money spent. And so we got together with the [ORG] and said, Well, how what can we do to create incentives to show the industry that we are serious about moving forward? Well, [CARDINAL] is loan guarantees, and that gives investors confidence that this Government is committed to the construction of nuclear powerplants. Secondly is production tax credits, and those credits will reward investments in the latest advanced nuclear power generation. In other words, there is incentives loan guarantee is an incentive, tax credits are incentives, [ORG] risk insurance. What the [ORG] risk insurance says is offered for the first [CARDINAL] new powerplant nuclear powerplants. And the insurance helps protect builders of the plants against lawsuits or bureaucratic obstacles and other delays beyond their control. We have got what is called the Nuclear Power 2010 Initiative, which is a [MONEY] partnership between [ORG] and the industry to facilitate new plant orders. In other words, I have said, we need more nuclear powerplants, and here is a strategy to get them going, see. Here is a way to say to the industry, we are serious about this. [DATE], [CARDINAL] companies were seeking to build nuclear powerplants. Now [CARDINAL] companies have expressed an interest in new construction, and they are considering [CARDINAL] new plants, trying to get these plants construction started by [DATE]. I want it to be said that this generation of folks had the foresight necessary to diversify our or to continue to diversify electricity supply and recognize that nuclear power is safe, and we did something about it. We just did not mark our time. We actually did something about it so a generation of [NORP] coming up will be able to have a better [GPE]. I understand the issue of waste, and we have got to do something about it. We have got to be wise about nuclear waste. I am a believer that Yucca Mountain is a scientifically sound place to send the waste, and I would hope that [ORG] [ORG] would recognize that as well. I also recognize that we can do something on a reprocessing front. And so I got our administration to commit to [ORG]. I think you will find this interesting; at least I did. Under the partnership, [GPE] is going to work with nations that have already got an advanced civilian nuclear energy program, such as [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE], and we are going to use new technologies that effectively and safely recycle spent nuclear fuel. In other words, we are coming together to say, how can we do a better job of reprocessing and recycling fuel? And the reason that is important, at least for our fellow citizens to understand, is it will reduce the amount of the toxicity of the fuel and reduce the amount we have to store. To me, it is a smart way to combine with others to reduce storage requirements for nuclear waste by [PERCENT]. It is a good way to work with other nations that are spending money on research and development as well. It is a way to, kind of, leverage up an investment. We are going to I have asked [ORG] to spend [MONEY] on this partnership. I hope they follow through with it. It is a necessary expenditure of money to make sure that the nuclear power industry can move forward with confidence, and the [NORP] people move forward with confidence as well. And so here are some ideas not only ideas; this is what we are doing; this has gone from idea to action. What I am telling you is, is that I understand the need to get off oil. I understand the need to work on renewable sources of energy. And I am pleased to report we are working with [ORG] to do it. We are spending your money on research and development to find interesting technologies. You know, I hope that when my grandchildren and some of your children start taking their driver's test, they will be cranking up a hydrogen-powered automobile, with hydrogen produced from electricity generated from plants such as these. We have a duty to think about the problems this country is going to face. Listen, this economy is good, and I want to keep it that way; but I also want to make sure it is good [DATE]. And I want to make sure that this global economy, this world that is becoming more connected, is one that does not cause us to fear and to neglect our duties, but that we put policies in place that enable us to remain confident, that we are an entrepreneurial society, that we are well-educated people, that we are willing to work hard to raise our families and put bread on the table. And we have got to make sure we have a good energy policy to do that. I want to thank you for giving me the chance to come and share with you [DATE] what the country is doing right now. I want to thank you very much for showing what is possible. I appreciate your hard work here. May God bless you all.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfarewellceremonyforgeneraljohnwvesseyjrchairmanthejointchiefsstaff", "text": "[PERSON], I hope you were not embarrassed by that uniform with the World War I helmet. The way I look at it, you are almost old enough now to run for [SPEAKER]. But, as I say, [PERSON], do not let the uniform upset you, because, you know, we enlisted in the reserves at about the same time, and believe me, you should have seen my uniform I was in the horse cavalry, which brings up an important point. You know, ladies and gentlemen, I recently disclosed that the real reason I ran for [SPEAKER] was to bring back the horse cavalry. And when I took office some people told me I was now the most powerful man in the world. So, now that you are retiring, [PERSON], maybe you can tell me why every time I have brought up the horse cavalry in [FAC], you and [PERSON] [PERSON]] would just smile and nod and say, Yes, Mr. [SPEAKER], and nothing would happen. Ladies and gentlemen, we are here [DATE] to honor and thank [PERSON] for his [DATE] of service and devotion to [GPE]. As you have heard, [PERSON] military career has taken him right to the top: [CARDINAL]-star general, Vice Chief of Staff of [ORG], and ultimately Chairman of [ORG] and all of this after receiving a battlefield commission. I know [PERSON] was proud of every rank and command he held; in each he performed with skill, competence, and devotion to duty. And yet for [PERSON], I suspect the title of which he was proudest was the first one he every held during [DATE] of military service, the one he earned [DATE] he joined [ORG], the title that said, [PERSON], soldier. General [PERSON] will be remembered for many things: as a battlefield hero you have heard [DATE] about North Africa, [PERSON], [PERSON], and that grim night with [ORG] in [GPE]; he will be remembered as a man of patriotism and deep religious belief, an officer who brought character and credit to every billet he ever held; as a military leader who always spoke his mind to civilian authority, respectfully but candidly; as the Chairman of [ORG] who presided over the restoration of [GPE]'s military strength and power at a moment critical to the fate of freedom and his country's security. In all these things, he bore the marks of greatness. But there is [CARDINAL] accomplishment that is not there in [PERSON] personnel file, yet it is an accomplishment that made the difference in the lives of so many GI's over [DATE] in so many places around the globe. [PERSON] always remembered the soldiers in the ranks; he understood those soldiers are the backbone of any army. He noticed them, spoke to them, looked out for them. [PERSON] never forgot what it was like to be an enlisted man, to be just a GI. [PERSON], of [GPE], [GPE], remembers. In [DATE], he was a private at [FAC], a member of the drill team there. He said recently that after [CARDINAL] drill team event, he was in his residence doing dishes before the volunteer army, way back when [PERSON] and I enlisted, it seems to me they had another name for doing dishes. Anyway, [PERSON] was told the commanding general wanted to see him. He was scared, of course, but he found his meeting and friendly chat with the general something he would always remember. After that, [PERSON] followed General [PERSON]'s career. Hearing about his retirement, he wrote to him recently: This short meeting made a lasting impression on me. It was amazing to me that you even knew I was on the premises... even more amazing that you would want to meet me. That moment of thoughtfulness for a lonely enlisted man back at [FAC] proved the truth of your reputation as a real soldier's general. There were many [PERSON] in [PERSON] career, and [PERSON] made their lives a little easier, a little less lonely. And he made them a little prouder to wear their country's uniform and defend freedom. [PERSON], in [DATE] that I have been doing events like this, I have learned something about people like you. A career like yours, combining as it does heroism, patriotism, competence, wisdom, and kindness, does not need elaboration from commanders in chief or [SPEAKER]; it speaks enough all by itself. And [DATE] I will let history be your valedictorian, not me. But what I can do [DATE] is thank you. On behalf of your friends here [DATE] who've had the honor of working with you and on behalf of some others who could not be here all your fellow [NORP], if they had the chance to be here, they would express their gratitude to you for making their lives and the lives of their children safer and more secure. And then, there is that other group I am standing in for [DATE]. I know all of them would want to be remembered to you. I am talking, of course, about those young people who wore the uniform for [PERSON], had the privilege of having their own GI general. So, from all of us, [PERSON] your friends, your fellow [NORP], but especially the soldiers who stood a little taller because of you thanks, thanks from a great and grateful nation. May God bless you and give you and [PERSON] many more rich, fruitful, and happy [DATE] together. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present to you a great soldier, a great general, a great GI [PERSON].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfederalemergencymanagementagencyemployees", "text": "Thank you all very much. Thank you. I admit he is not very pretty to look at. But he is doing a heck of a job. I am so proud of my friend. It is become clear to all the hard-working [ORG] employees that I did not pick [PERSON] because of his haircut. But I picked him because he is a good man who knows how to run a very important organization. And I am proud of my friend. I am proud of the job he is doing. And I am proud of the work that the [ORG] employees all across the country are doing on behalf of [GPE]. I am here to thank you all. I was up in the operations room, thanking the folks who are working [TIME] a day, still, to [DATE]. I had the honor of going to [GPE]; I saw what they call dirty boot operations, from [GPE] and [GPE] all [ORG] employees, all people who love their fellow [NORP], all who want to join in to say loud and clear to the evildoers, Your actions will not stand in [GPE]. [PERSON] said it best. He said, This is something I hope I never have to go through again as long as I live. I know every [ORG] employee feels that way. After all, yours was an organization that was used to dealing with, generally, acts of nature, hurricanes or tornadoes and fires or floods. And then all of a sudden, some evil people came and they declared war on [GPE]. And your agency and the good working people, true [NORP], had to rise to the occasion. And rise, you did. And for that, the people of [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and every other [GPE] in the Union are proud of the job you are doing. So on behalf of the [NORP] people, I say thanks from the bottom of our hearts for the [ORG] employees. I also want to talk about the battle we face, the campaign to protect freedom; the willingness of the [NORP] people to not only repair the damage done but the willingness of our Nation to stand united, to say loud and clear that freedom will stand, that you can tear down our buildings but you cannot tear down our spirit, that we are strong and united in the cause of freedom not only here in [GPE] but all around the world. This will be a different kind of campaign than [NORP] are used to. It is a campaign that must be fought on many fronts. And I am proud to report that we are making progress on many fronts. Not only have the [ORG] employees showed the world what it is like to stand up and help a neighbor in need; we are also beginning to make progress on the financial front. As you may remember, I made it clear that part of winning the war against terror would be to cut off these evil people's money; it would be to trace their assets and freeze them, cut off their cash flows, hold people accountable who fund them, who allow the funds to go through their institutions, and not only do that at home but to convince others around the world to join us in doing so. Thus far, we have frozen [MONEY] in bank accounts linked to terrorist activity. We have frozen [CARDINAL] [ORG] accounts in [GPE] and [CARDINAL] overseas. And we are just beginning. Also, on the military front, we are making progress. We have deployed [CARDINAL] military personnel and [CARDINAL] carrier battle groups, as well as an amphibious-ready group and [CARDINAL] military aircraft. We have called [CARDINAL] 000 members of the reserve to active duty, as well as [CARDINAL] [ORG] operating under [ORG] authority. As I said, this is a different kind of war. It is hard to fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces. But our military is ready. And as I said to the [ORG], they will make us proud. In this new kind of war, one that requires a coalition, we are making good progress on the diplomatic front. At our request, [ORG] unanimously enacted a binding resolution requiring all its members to deny financing support or safe harbor to terrorists. We have had [CARDINAL] declarations of support from organizations including [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG]. You see, the evildoers like to hit, and then they try to hide. And slowly but surely, we are going to make sure they have no place to hide. Slowly but surely, we are going to move them out of their holes and what they think is safe havens and get them on the move. We are a patient nation. We are a nation who has got a long-term view, a nation that is come to realize that in order to make freedom prevail, the evildoers will be forced to run and will eventually be brought to justice. Now, along those lines, we are taking any threat seriously here at home. The [ORG] has conducted [CARDINAL] of interviews and searches, issued [CARDINAL] of subpoenas, and arrested or detained [CARDINAL] people as it investigates the attacks. [CARDINAL] terrorists and their supporters, as well, have been arrested or detained in [CARDINAL] different countries. In my speech to the [ORG], I said, sometimes the [NORP] people are not going to see exactly what is taking place on their TV screens. But slowly but surely, the results are coming in. You see, we have said to people around the world, This could have happened to you. This could have easily have taken place on your soil. So you need to take threats seriously as well. We are beginning to share intelligence amongst our nations. We are finding out members of the [ORG] organization, who they are, where they think they can hide. And we are slowly but surely bringing them to justice. We are slowly but surely calling their hand and reining them in. We have just begun. There is [CARDINAL] detained and more to come. And along these lines, [DATE], through the collaborative efforts of intelligence and law enforcement, we have arrested a known terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of [CARDINAL] [GPE] citizens during a hijacking in [DATE], a terrorist by the name of [PERSON]. He is not affiliated with [ORG], yet he is an example of the wider war on terrorism and what we intend to do. Here is a man who killed [CARDINAL] of our own citizens when he hijacked a plane in [GPE]. By the way, obviously, there is [CARDINAL] [NORP] that is [CARDINAL] too many but there was a lot of people from other countries, as well, involved. And he was convicted and sentenced to death, yet he only served [DATE]. Well, we arrested him; we got him; we brought him into [GPE]. And [DATE] [GPE] will charge him with murder. Sometimes we will have success in the near term; sometimes we have to be patient. Sometimes we will be able to round somebody up who threatens us [DATE]; sometimes it may take us awhile to catch him. But the lesson of this case, and every case, is that this mighty [ORG] will not rest until we protect ourselves, our citizens, and freedom-loving people around the world. The evildoers struck, and when they did, they aroused a mighty land, a land of compassionate people, a land who wants to help a neighbor in need, but a land who stands solidly on principles, the principles of freedom: freedom to worship, freedom to govern, freedom to speak, freedom to assemble. We sent a loud message to the world: We will not be cowed by a few. We sent another message to the world: Together, we are going to bring these people to justice. And that is exactly what we are going to do. Thank you for your hard work. I want to thank you all so very much for your hard work and for your love for [GPE]. May God bless you all. May God continue to bless [GPE]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}

Thanks for coming out to say hello. It is great to be in southern [GPE]. I appreciate the chance to come to [GPE]. I am honored to be the first sitting [SPEAKER] to visit the city of [GPE]. I am sorry [PERSON] is not with me. [SPEAKER]. That is generally the reaction. I was hoping she and I could go look at the Catsup Bottle. Thanks for waiting on me. I had a visit with some of the some folks from the area here, a neurosurgeon, a cardiologist, the administrator of a hospital, ob-gyn, a patient, all about the health care crisis that exists here in this part of the world. And that is what I am here to talk about. I am here to talk about how we need to fix a broken medical liability system. I want to thank all the good folks who provide health care for the folks in this part of the world, the nurses, the docs, the administrators. Thank you all for coming. Thanks for your compassion. Thanks for your care. Thanks for taking an active interest in an important issue that faces not only this part of the world but the country. But really what I am here to do is to make say as clearly as I can, [ORG] [ORG] needs to pass real medical liability reform [DATE]. And there is no doubt in my mind we have a strong ally in this issue in the great Speaker of [ORG] from the great State of [GPE], [PERSON]. And I want to thank Congressman [PERSON] for his leadership not only on this issue but on other issues. It is good to be with his wife, [PERSON], again, sons, [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. Nice to see you boys. And you brought Mom and Dad. Your mom is probably telling you what to do, just like mine is. You are probably listening [CARDINAL] the time, just like I am. Welcome. I am also proud to be traveling [DATE] with a great Congressman from [GPE], [GPE], [PERSON]. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you coming. The State Treasurer of [GPE] has joined us, [PERSON]. Appreciate you. [PERSON] is here. He is the minority leader in the house. I will tell you what he is doing in the house of representatives for [GPE]: He is leading the medical liability reform effort. And I want to thank you, [PERSON], for taking a strong role. Appreciate you coming. I know the mayor is here. Mr. [PERSON] yes, he is here, [PERSON]. I appreciate you coming, Mr. [PERSON]. Appreciate you being here. I usually like to give mayors unsolicited advice: Fill the potholes. You have probably got some advice for me: Pass the highway bill. I want to thank those of you who are working on this medical liability issue here in [GPE]. I appreciate your efforts. Look, it is about time the medical profession gets involved. It is about time you let people know what is on your mind. It is time to make sure that the issue comes to the forefront not only at the Federal level but at the local level as well. I want to thank [PERSON]. I met [PERSON]. She came out to the airport airbase, and kind of airbase-airport combo, I guess it is. She is a volunteer for [ORG]. The reason I bring her up is, every stop I make in [GPE] I like to herald a citizen who is taken time out of his or her life to volunteer to make the country a better place. See, the great strength of [GPE] is not our military might, and it is certainly not the size of our wallets. The great strength of [GPE] lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens, people who are willing to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved themselves, people who are willing to take time to volunteer to make [GPE] a better place. And [PERSON] is such a person. And I want to thank you for serving [ORG]. And speaking about [ORG], [ORG] is doing heroic work in a part of the world that has suffered incredible, incredible death and destruction. The [NORP] people express our sympathy to the victims of the tsunami disasters. [DATE] I spoke to Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] and Governor [PERSON] of [GPE], who I sent on a delegation with a delegation to assess the relief operations. And they reported in that the devastation is beyond comprehension. They also reported in that they will come back with an assessment about how we can more effectively help. But they also reported that our military is doing heroic work in helping to save life. They are flying rescue missions [TIME] a day. They are making a huge difference in the people's lives over there by delivering supplies directly to those in need. Our Government has not only stepped up with the use of military assets, but we have pledged [MONEY] in disaster assistance to help the people over there who are suffering. There is huge generosity here in [GPE] as well. As you know, I tapped a couple of ex-President's number [CARDINAL] and number [CARDINAL], to help out. I asked them to help, and they are. My dad and President [PERSON] have graciously given of their time to help make sure that people know there is a need and to make sure the donations are properly channeled into programs that work. If you want to help, get on the Internet for the [GPE] www.usafreedomcorps.gov. There is a place to help. And on that web page, you will find different agencies which are doing the good work. What I do not want is, I do not want people to be sending money to places that are not really doing the job. We do not need to support organizations that are not effectively delivering compassion and help. And so on this web page, you will find a way to help, if you so desire to do so. What they tell me is, the most important contribution a person can give is cash, and let the agencies on the ground be able to use that cash to best meet the needs of those who have suffered. I want to thank all the [NORP] who thus far have been participating in this urgent cause. You are showing the true strength of [GPE] through your good heart. I do not know if you know this: This is my first trip after the New Year. And it is good to come here to [GPE]. I am rested and ready to continue to serve to be your to continue to be your [SPEAKER] and to serve the people of this country. And we have got a big agenda item a big agenda and a series of items that we will be dealing with. First of all, we are going to win the war on terror. We have still got to we will be steadfast. We will be resolved. We will be wise. We will not give in to these people. We have a duty in your Government to protect the [NORP] people. So the second big task at hand is to make sure we do everything we can to protect our homeland. And I will assure you I will continue to work to spread freedom and democracy and, therefore, peace in parts of the world that are desperate for freedom, democracy, and peace. We are going to work with the [ORG] to be wise about how we spend your money. We are going to keep your taxes low so this economy continues to grow. We are going to continue to work with our farmers and ranchers to make sure they can sell the products overseas, in markets where people need food and beef and pork. We are going to work to pass a national energy plan. We are going to work to cut our deficit in [CARDINAL] over [DATE]. And I look forward to working with members of both political parties to do something about our health care system. First, it is important for [NORP] to understand we have the best health care system in the world. And we need to keep it that way. We have got the best hospitals, both urban and rural. We have got the world's most talented and compassionate doctors and nurses. And we have got the world's and we lead the world in innovative research. We are on the cutting edge of change. We are saving lives through our research. [NORP] should be proud of our medical system, and we all must be grateful for those who work hard to provide compassion and care. Our health care system faces serious challenges. We all know that. The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many [NORP] are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we have got to take those steps [DATE]. To improve health care in [GPE], we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It is a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do. To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply [DATE] information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our [ORG] system still allows seniors to have choice in the system. There is a lot we can do. We have got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we have got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by [ORG] but by patients and doctors. To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we have got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned. Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. World-class medical technology is expensive. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. But some costs are not necessary. And that is what the [NORP] people must understand and Members of [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG] must understand. Many of the costs that we are talking about do not start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom. What is happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. That is just a plain fact. And they are doing it for a simple reason: They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in [DATE]. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That is what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it is expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it does not have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying [MONEY] to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong. That is what is happening in the system [DATE]. It is a system that is just not fair. It is costly for the doctors. It is costly for small businesses. It is costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients. When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You are about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact. Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you are paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That is the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you are a patient, it means you are paying a higher cost to go see your doctor. If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that is what the people of southern [GPE] and the people of [GPE] must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you are paying for it. For some physicians, even raising costs for patients is not enough to afford the premium increases caused by these lawsuits. And so physicians are faced with a terrible choice: give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine. And that problem affects all doctors, from family practitioners in rural towns to surgeons in big-city hospitals. In [DATE], [CARDINAL] of all [NORP] hospitals lost physicians or reduced services because of medical liability concerns. Think about that: [CARDINAL] of all [NORP] hospitals lost physicians. Over [DATE], the liability crisis has forced out [CARDINAL] physicians in [GPE] and [GPE] counties alone. When doctors move or close their practices, guess who suffers: the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose [TIME] in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you are trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It is a problem that we must address. [GPE]'s health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, does not it? If you are worried about getting sued, you are going to do everything you can to make sure you do not get sued. That is why doctors practice what is called defensive medicine. That means they are writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really are not necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit. They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains [MONEY] from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand. This liability system of ours is, what I am telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I am talking about. A recent study ranked [GPE] the number [CARDINAL] place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And that is a ranking I am sure you'd like to get rid of. And those of you traveling in from [GPE] are not doing much better. [GPE] is ranked the second county in [GPE] where you are likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the [GPE] area, you can be pretty sure they are not looking for horseradish. Let me share some of the stories of the folks I met with [DATE]. I think this will help clarify what I am trying to say to you. Dr. [PERSON] is with us. He is a neurosurgeon from [ORG] and [ORG]. Raise your hand, Doc. He is [CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL] neurosurgeons still practicing south of [GPE], [GPE]. You have got [CARDINAL] people in the area. In [DATE], his [DATE] premiums have more than doubled from $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year to $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year. And at the same time, his amount of insurance coverage has been cut in [CARDINAL]. [DATE], [PERSON] decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got [CARDINAL] the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats [CARDINAL] of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern [GPE] have to be airlifted across the river to [GPE]. He said, It is very distressing. I spent [DATE] of training to do brain surgery. It is a big part of my life. I made a commitment to stay here, but I had to make adjustments to keep the ax from falling. The system needs to be fixed. Dr. [PERSON] is with us. He is from [GPE], and he is a cardiologist. He was raised in [GPE], and he moved to [GPE] in [DATE], even though his colleagues warned him about the medical liability crisis here. In [DATE], his premiums have risen from $[MONEY], 500 to $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year [DATE]. [DATE] he had to stop performing certain procedures to bring his costs under control. He said, You either have to change the nature of your practice, or you have to leave. He did not want to leave, so he is having to cut back on his services. We have got a problem, folks. I met with [PERSON]. He is the CEO of [ORG]. That is big [PERSON]. He is a father of [CARDINAL], I want you to know. His hospital has a long tradition of delivering babies, but [DATE], he made the difficult decision to close his ob unit. The malpractice see, he had the they employ the doctors in his hospital. They become the employer. They are going to cover the insurance for them, and it doubled from $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] to $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] more than doubled. They are paying $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year now. That is a lot for a little hospital in a small town. Maybe for a big hospital, it is not a lot, or for those of us who are used to dealing with the [ORG] budget, it is not a lot. It is a lot for a small town hospital. [ORG] used to handle [CARDINAL] deliveries a year. But now a lot of the women have to drive [TIME] to get to an ob unit. He said, You would not get an ob-gyn to come here. It is affecting rural medicine. It happens to be the medical liability crisis, is affecting rural medicine. Lawsuits are affecting rural medicine. It is a societal issue that has to be dealt with. I could not put it any better, [PERSON]. It is a societal issue that we must deal with. It is a quality of life issue. We do not want our little towns being not having any health care. We want people who live in rural [GPE], like [GPE], [GPE] to be able to get to have a quality of life [applause]. [PERSON] is with us. She is an ob-gyn from [GPE]. She spent her entire career as a doctor in southern [GPE], and she has never been sued. She is a good doc. She shut down her practice on [DATE] because her premiums have skyrocketed out of control. That means she could not afford to stay in practice. She had a choice to make: quit practicing medicine, or go broke. She said, I do not want to quit practicing medicine and I am not going broke, so I am going to move to [GPE]. You lost a good soul from this part of the world because the system is out of control. [PERSON]'s premiums will be [PERCENT] lower in [GPE] than here in [GPE]. I met with [PERSON], who is right with us yes, there she is. She was one of [PERSON]'s patients. She is expecting her second child [DATE] like, soon. When she found out she was pregnant [DATE], [PERSON] started seeing the ob-gyn that delivered her daughter, [PERSON]. That ob-gyn moved to [GPE]. Then she started seeing [PERSON]. [PERSON] is moving to [GPE]. [PERSON] is now on her third ob-gyn, and she is worried about it. She said, I understand the doctors' position. I do not blame them. But as a patient, I see them leave and I think, what am I going to do now, and where does that leave me? I feel like I have lost control over how my pregnancy will go. Unfortunately, this is not just a story confined to this part of the world. This is a story of pregnant moms all over [GPE] who are wondering whether or not they are going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I have come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, [CARDINAL], I understand the problem and I intend to work with [ORG] to do something about it. You know, when I was the Governor of [GPE], I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. And there was [CARDINAL] things wrong with that strategy. [CARDINAL] is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you are not solving the problem, you are just shifting the problem. You are making the quality of life issue go from [CARDINAL] area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from [CARDINAL] area to the next. That did not seem to make any sense. But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your [ORG] budget spends [MONEY] a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for [ORG] and [ORG] and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution. So I went to [ORG] with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We have got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we do not want a system that is so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care. I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, [PERCENT] of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. Seems to be fair, if you get hurt. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages. And in the case of truly egregious wrongdoing, patients should be entitled to punitive damages. But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that is why I proposed a hard cap of $[MONEY], 000 on noneconomic damages. Interestingly enough, [GPE] has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in [DATE]. Patients in that [GPE] see their claims settled a third faster than in [GPE] without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there is a cap. And since [DATE], insurance premiums for [GPE] doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most [GPE]. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It is a good idea, and the [ORG] ought to adopt them. We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It is simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, [ORG] needs to pass joint and several liability reform. I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. I know you do. I know the people of this part of the world understand it, because you see firsthand what happens when the system gets out of control: [CARDINAL] docs leave [CARDINAL] counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit. I know you are serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on [DATE] about medical liability. The [ORG] passed a good medical liability reform bill [DATE]. I want to thank the [CARDINAL] Members of [ORG] for working on it. The [ORG] failed to get the job done. Well, the new [ORG] is starting over, you know. We have got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the [NORP] people. Both [ORG] will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I am looking forward to working with the leadership of the [ORG] to get the bill moving. It is important for the [GPE] Senators from this State and other [GPE] to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in [DATE]. Junk lawsuits affect more than just the medical field. According to a recent study, frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort system to [MONEY] a year. That is the equivalent of [MONEY] for every family of [CARDINAL]. The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. [PERCENT] of all new jobs in [GPE] are created by small businesses. The tort costs in [GPE] are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. Think about that. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for [NORP] manufacturers and entrepreneurs. And so here are some actions [ORG] can take as well. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in [GPE]. The number of class actions filed here increased by [PERCENT] [DATE], even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from [GPE]. Think about that. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed [applause]. I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the [ORG] [DATE]. I will also work with [ORG] to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern [GPE] and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of [CARDINAL] of companies and cost [CARDINAL] of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. [CARDINAL] 000 new asbestos claims were filed [DATE] alone. [ORG] has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. They need to act and get the job done. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in [DATE]. I think we are sent to [GPE] to solve problems, not to pass them on to future [ORG]. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it is hard work for some in [ORG] to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. But all we are asking for is fairness. We want our doctors treated fairly. We want the hospitals treated fairly. And most of all, we want the patients and the [NORP] people treated fairly. And I appreciate you all giving me a chance to come by and talk about the vital issue of legal reform. I intend to go back to [GPE] here shortly, and when I see Members of the [ORG] as I work this issue, I am going to say, I spoke to the good folks of southern [GPE]. They understand the problem, and they expect you, Members of [ORG] and [ORG], to get the job done. Thanks for coming by to say hello. I hope you and your families have [DATE]. May God bless you all.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingmeetingwithprimeministernurialmalikiiraq", "text": "[SPEAKER] [SPEAKER]. Hello, everybody. Before I discuss the meeting that I have just had with Prime Minister [PERSON], I just want to make a brief statement about [GPE]. I had the opportunity to speak with President [PERSON] [TIME], and I wanted to congratulate him on accepting the certification of the recent election. As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in [GPE], to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty. President [PERSON], as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the [NORP] people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the [NORP] people's will should be done. And so I expressed the [NORP] people's appreciation for this step. As I mentioned before, this has been a difficult election. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in [GPE]. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we have seen is elections take place. We have now seen the [ORG] and the [ORG] in [GPE] complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process. I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador [PERSON] and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator [PERSON], who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador [PERSON] and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations. Moving forward, we will continue to work with our [ORG] partners as well as [ORG], however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the [NORP] that we can move [GPE] towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the [NORP] people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken [DATE], and we hope that we can build on this progress. I finally want to thank the incredible work of our [GPE] military and the young men and women who are stationed in [GPE] who are doing so much to help bring about a more secure and prosperous and democratic [GPE]. I am grateful to have the opportunity to see Prime Minister [PERSON] once again. We had a wide-ranging discussion about the continuing progress that [GPE] is making. We have seen in [DATE] a consolidation of a commitment to democratic politics inside of [GPE]. We are very interested, both of us, in making sure that [GPE] has an election law that is completed on time so that elections can take place on time in [DATE]. That is consistent with the transition that has been taking place, and I reemphasized my commitment to Prime Minister [PERSON] that we will have our combat troops out of [GPE] by [DATE] and all of our troops out of [GPE] by [DATE]. But we did not just talk about military and security issues. What is wonderful about this trip is that it represents a transition in our bilateral relationship, so that we are moving now to issues beyond security and we are beginning to talk about economy, trade, commerce. The business and investment conference that is taking place is going to be very well attended. It includes not only Prime Minister [PERSON] but business leaders from both [GPE] and [GPE]. We have seen over [DATE] progress being made on providing clarification about investment laws inside of [GPE]. There are, obviously, enormous opportunities for our countries to do business together. And so I just want to congratulate Prime Minister [PERSON] on what I am confident will be a successful conference and to reemphasize my administration's full support for all the steps that can be taken so that [GPE] can not only be a secure place and a democratic country but also a place where people can do business, people can find work, families can make a living, and children are well educated. And that broader sense of a [GPE] relationship with a democratic [GPE] is one that I think all of us are confident we can now achieve. So thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister, for your presence here [DATE]. And I do not know if you maybe we could translate the last part just about [GPE], as opposed to [GPE], just in case there is some Prime Minister [PERSON]. Thank you, [SPEAKER], and this opportunity to hold the business investment conference is a big economic demonstration and manifestation of the importance of this event that brings together [CARDINAL], 000 business entrepreneurs and a very distinguished, high-level [NORP] delegation. I have also discussed with [SPEAKER] the various issues and the fact that our relations [DATE] have moved along and not only confined to the security cooperation but [DATE] have moved to the economic development and to providing prosperity for the [NORP] people. We have discussed the issues of common interest to our bilateral relations under the that are [DATE] framed under the strategic framework agreement and the various sectors, and all this is important for broader relation of our [CARDINAL] nations. We have also discussed the issue of the elections and the importance that these elections be held on time based on the national principles. We have also commented on the role of [GPE] that supports [GPE] and the importance to end the international sanctions on [GPE] and to remove [GPE] from under chapter 7, because we do not have weapons of mass destructions anymore, and [DATE], that we have put forth a lot of common sacrifices, and [DATE], that there is a pluralistic political system in [GPE]. This is important to move [GPE] forward and to promote investments. We will follow up on the outcome of the business investment conference in its various sectors because [DATE], [GPE] has moved beyond a dictatorship and beyond the destruction, and we are trying to rebuild all our sectors of agriculture, oil sectors, tourism, and so forth. We want to give the [GPE] companies an opportunity to be present in investing in [GPE], and all this cooperation on the basis of the strategic framework agreement. I thank you very much. [SPEAKER] . Okay, thank you, everybody.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingroundtablediscussionthehomemortgageindustry", "text": "All right. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. We are here with a wonderful group of homeowners. And I think for so many people around this country, the essence of the American Dream is owning your own home, being able to have that piece of property that is yours, that allows you to raise your kids, that represents your single biggest investment. And obviously, one of the triggers of the financial crisis and now the economic crisis that we have suffered is that because in some areas housing got--housing values got way overheated, in some cases you had a lack of regulation that allowed all sorts of complex financial instruments take advantage of homeowners. We have seen a collapse in the housing market, a precipitous drop in values, and that led to a lot of the problems in the financial markets. Here is the good news. At the beginning of this administration, we said we are--we were going to tackle directly the problems that homeowners were experiencing and figure out ways in which we could provide them assistance in reducing their interest rates, modifying their loans so that they would be in a position to stay in their homes and reduce their [DATE] payments. And around the table here you see some wonderful families who have taken advantage of what are now historically low mortgage rates, brought about in part by some extraordinary actions by [ORG], but also brought about by the housing plan that [PERSON] and [PERSON] to design. What you have seen now is rates are as low as they have been since [DATE]. [CARDINAL] of the [NORP] people get their mortgages through a [ORG]/[ORG] qualified loan. And as a consequence of us being able to reduce the interest rates that are available, we have now seen some extraordinary jumps in the rate of mortgage refinancings. And everybody here represents families who have saved [MONEY] a month, [MONEY] a year in some cases, and that is money directly in their pocket. More importantly, what it is allowed them to do is to consolidate their loans in some cases, reduce the length of their mortgages in other cases. It has given them the kind of security and stability in their mortgage payments that a lot more people can take advantage of. So the main message that we want to send [DATE] is, there are [CARDINAL] people across the country who right now could be taking advantage of lower mortgage rates. That is money in their pocket. And we estimate that the average family can get [MONEY], 000 a year in savings by taking advantage of these various mortgage programs that have been put in place. We have already seen a substantial jump, [PERCENT] increase in refinancings over [DATE]. We have seen [ORG] refinance [MONEY] of mortgages in [DATE], which is their highest volume in [DATE] since [DATE]. And rates on [DATE] mortgages have dropped to an alltime low of [PERCENT]. So we are at a time where people can really take advantage of this. And what we want to do is to send a message that if you are having problems with your mortgage, and even if you are not and you just want to save some money, you can go to makinghomeaffordable.gov--makinghomeaffordable.gov. And the way the web site is designed, you can plug in your information and immediately find out whether or not you are potentially eligible for one of these mortgage refinancings. Now, we are in the process of rolling out some additional phases to the program. Everybody here represent responsible homeowners who made their payments, who have jobs and income that support their mortgages. In some cases, people may have had difficulties because they lost a job, somebody in their family got sick, they may have missed some payments. And in those cases we also want to be helpful, and we are putting in place a loan modification program, working with banks, working with services, that will allow other folks who are closer to losing their home in a stronger position in the future. So there are a range of different programs that are available for a range of different types of borrowers. The main message we want to send [DATE] is, is that the programs that have been put in place can help responsible folks who have been making their payments, who are not looking for a handout, but this allows them to make some changes that will leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes. So we hope that everybody takes advantage of it. Again, the web site is makinghomeaffordable.gov--is that right?--makinghomeaffordable.gov, so get on the web site, find out what is available. Last point we want to make. As people have become aware that the Government is helping to promote refinancing, we are starting to see some scam artists out there who are contacting people saying, You can refinance your home. The Government has got a program; we are ready to help. Oh, but by the way, first you have got to pay some money. I just want everybody who is watching [DATE] to know that if somebody is asking you for money up front before they help you with your refinancing, it is probably a scam. So take advantage of makinghomeaffordable.gov, and that will allow you to figure out exactly how to proceed on this in a way that is making you money, saving you money, as opposed to costing you money. All right. Thank you, everybody.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksgroupvisitingforeigneducators", "text": "I want to say how proud we have been that you chose to come to this country to examine our educational system, and I am sure that you taught us during your visit here more than you learned. There is, I know, a great tendency in every country, including my own, to consider education important but perhaps not so vital. We are so concerned in so many parts of the world with the problems that are coming [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE] and it does take [DATE] to educate a boy or girl and therefore there is a tendency to concentrate available resources on the problems we face now, and perhaps ignore what the potentialities and capabilities will be of our people [DATE]. [PERSON] once said that if you expect a people to be ignorant and free you expect what never was and never will be. And from the beginning of this country, in order to maintain a very difficult discipline which is self-government, we have placed a major emphasis on education. My own feeling is, we have to do better-not only in quantity but also in quality, and I am hopeful that we can develop in this country a cult of excellence in regard to education and intellectual development, which will make this country more equipped to meet its problems. What is true of us I am sure is true of you. In some of your countries your problems are entirely different, and that is, making it possible for, in the mass, to educate great numbers of your people who [DATE] do not have that advantage, and also making sure that at the higher level we can train and then usefully employ men and women to serve not only their own interests but that of their country. I want you to know we are very proud to have you here. Our educational system has represented the devoted efforts of our citizenry, but I think we can always do better. And perhaps by your presence here, and your questions, and your concerns, you have been able to stimulate us to move more forward along what I consider to be the most vital function of society: educating our people-making it possible for them to realize their potentials, and by serving their own personalities and development, serving the national interest. So we are glad to see you and we hope that when you go home you will be able to communicate to them not only things that you may have liked here, or disliked, but also the sense of a people desiring to improve themselves and their country.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringthe2006nationalandstateteacherstheyear", "text": "AboutSearch I was going to say, thank you, [PERSON], for those kind remarks. Please be seated. Thank you all. Welcome. This is one of the great afternoons for [PERSON] and me. We love to recognize our teachers. We really appreciate you coming. Actually, this is an [DATE] event started by [PERSON]. And I am glad to be a part of a tradition here at [FAC], saying thanks to our teachers. I admire teachers and like teachers so much, I married one. [PERSON] is a great advocate for literacy and a strong supporter for [GPE]'s teachers, and I am really proud to have her by my side during these unbelievable times and this great experience of serving our country-other than being a fine introducer. The thing I like about teaching is, teaching is such an optimistic profession. I know when teachers look out at their classrooms, you see more than a child at play or at study. You are able to see a child with big dreams and big hopes. You see future doctors and scientists and entrepreneurs and inventors, and I hope you see even a teacher or [CARDINAL]. You dedicated your lives to the formation of young minds. You are giving our children the skills they need to succeed in life and equally important, the courage and the drive to realize those dreams. Our Nation is grateful for your hard work. We appreciate what you do, and we are honored you are here at [FAC]. I want to thank our Secretary of Education, [PERSON]. She is been a long-time friend. She believes strongly in the classroom teacher, and she believes in the potential of every child. I am pleased to recognize Senator [PERSON], for the State of [GPE]. Welcome. I am glad you are here-and his wife, [PERSON]; thank you for coming. As well as Congressman [PERSON] from [GPE] and [GPE], thank you all for taking time to honor the teachers who are here. I appreciate the National Teacher of the Year Finalists: [PERSON] from Florida- say hello to the Governor-[PERSON] of [GPE]-no wonder you all are here-and [PERSON] of [GPE]. We are really glad you are here. Congratulations on setting such a fine example. Everybody here has been introduced to [PERSON], but you have not met her parents, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Thank you all very much-brothers, cousins, and significant other. I want to thank all the Teachers of the Year from around our country who are here. I really-[PERSON] and I really enjoyed having our picture with you. It is just a brief moment to say thanks. But nevertheless, it is thanks from the bottom of our hearts. And it really means a lot you are here. I thank Dr. [PERSON], who is the executive director of [ORG]. That is one of the sponsoring organizations. Thank you for your service, [PERSON]. [PERSON], of [ORG] I want to thank [PERSON] for being here. That is also a sponsoring organization of this event. [PERSON] is the president of [ORG], is here with us, as well as [PERSON], who is the executive vice president. These are the sponsoring groups of this important occasion. I also want to thank the chief state school officers who are with us. Good to see you all. Nice going. Hiring and promoting good teachers is a really important part of your job. I want you to know that we know that being a teacher is difficult work. It is a hard job. It is a job that requires compassion and determination and extraordinary patience. And as [PERSON] hinted, or maybe did not hint, I was probably one of those kind that tested your patience. You are helping young people to learn the basics of reading and writing and adding and subtracting. You are serving as mentors and, probably most importantly, as role models. You help kindle young imaginations, and you inspire a love of learning. It is a pretty significant job description, when you think about it. And the teachers we honor here [DATE] are excelling at that job. Your [DATE] efforts help young [NORP] grow into successful adults. In other words, you are building the future for the country. We ask a lot of our teachers, and we owe you a lot in return. Education is my top domestic priority. And when I first came to office, I worked with members of both political parties-believe it or not, it is possible here in [GPE] to occasionally do that-to increase funding from the Federal level but also to pass the No Child Left Behind Act. The spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, society has a deep obligation to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations, that we believe every child can learn, and therefore, we believe it makes sense to determine whether or not every child is learning. And if not, there ought to be extra help so that no child in our society is left behind. We are beginning to see good results, thanks to our Nation's teachers. The [DATE] Nation's Report Card showed [GPE]'s fourth graders are posting the best scores in reading and math in the history of the test. [NORP] and [NORP] fourth graders set records in reading and math [DATE]. [GPE]'s eighth graders earned the best math scores ever recorded. Eighth grade [NORP] and [NORP] students achieved their highest math scores ever. We are making really important strides toward closing an achievement gap in [GPE], and I want to thank our teachers for your hard work. There is more work to be done, obviously. I have recently launched [ORG], which will help our students do better in math and science. We need to train [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] high school teachers to lead AP courses in math and science. I know we have got some AP teachers here, and I want to thank you for that. We need to bring [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] math and science professionals into our classrooms to send a message to our children: It is okay to be a mathematician or a scientist-as a matter of fact, it is cool. We want to make sure that we help students who struggle with math get extra help to make sure that-to make sure they have a chance to be able to earn the high-wage jobs of [DATE]. If we ensure that [GPE]'s children have the skills they need to succeed in life, we will make sure [GPE] succeeds in the world. Improving the quality of education for young [NORP] requires good laws and good policies, but ultimately it depends on good teachers. And that is why we are here on the South Lawn, to honor really good teachers. The Teacher of [DATE], [PERSON], teaches kindergarten at [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. [ORG] is [GPE] highest poverty school, a place where [PERCENT] of the children qualify for federally-subsidized meals and [PERCENT] have parents who do not speak English at home. It is a school filled with the kind of students that inspired [PERSON] to become a teacher. [PERSON] decided to become a teacher at a young age. It is really interesting for teachers to hear what she said. She said, As a young child, I loved and admired my day care teacher, Mrs. [PERSON]. I wanted to be just like her. Mrs. [PERSON] made me feel special, as if I were the only child in her class. [PERSON] had many friends growing up who came from unstable and impoverished homes. She says, I watched so many of my friends live up to the low expectations that were set for them. To [DATE], I find myself wondering, what if my disadvantaged friends had [DATE] worth of Mrs. [PERSON] in their lives? [PERSON] went on to say, I chose to become a teacher to motivate and inspire the neediest students, who many have written off, and let them know they can achieve and succeed in life regardless of what the statistics may show. I love that attitude. I think you are beginning to get the drift of why she is the Teacher of [DATE]. When [PERSON] arrived at [FAC] in [DATE], the school was threatened with forced restructuring by the [ORG] as a result of poor academic performance. Ms. [PERSON] took a leadership role at the school. That is what good teachers do; they take the lead. She became a teacher-leader and helped lead a collaborative effort to improve the curriculum, instruction, and assessment. She helped establish instructional planning sessions and formal procedures to examine student work and improve student performance. She noticed that many parents at the school lacked the language skills to be able to read to their children and to be able to help with their school work. And so she and her colleagues purchased cassette players and recorded books on tape for the students to take home and share with their families, which made it a lot easier for parents who struggle with English to help their children. [PERSON] also organized a regular Books and Supper Night, where families could check out books from the library and read together before sharing a dinner, which fostered learning and family involvement in their children's education. She knows what good teachers know: If you can get the parents involved in the child's education, you have a much better chance of succeeding. She set high expectations. Good teachers set high expectations. She provided needed assistance. She involved families, and she helped turn that school around. Within [DATE] of her arrival, kindergarten students at [FAC] were mastering early reading skills at higher rates than other schools in the district. After [DATE], [ORG] students were meeting or exceeding all requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. There were dramatic increases in reading and math scores for the school's second graders. The Superintendent of Schools in [GPE] says this about the impact [PERSON] has had: She has a rare gift for touching hearts and minds, inspiring in her students to aim high and believe in their potential. A [FAC] parent says, She knows how to talk to the children so they will listen. And all her students know that she cares about them. She made them all feel like they were smart and could learn anything. [CARDINAL] of her colleagues says, When you walk into Ms. [PERSON]'s classroom, one cannot help but notice that this is a special place. She is dedicated to her school community and committed to excellence, and she has been an instrumental force in improving student achievement at her school. [PERSON] says the reason her students are achieving is simple: I have high expectations for each of them. I teach them that they can accomplish anything with hard work and persistence. [PERSON] understands that the key to helping children succeed is fighting the soft bigotry of low expectations. When a teacher believes that a child can learn, it is amazing what happens; a student believes that he or she can learn. [GPE] is blessed to have teachers like [PERSON]. We are blessed to have teachers like all those who are gathered here at [FAC]. We thank you for the love and devotion you have shown our children [DATE]. May God continue to bless your work, and may God continue to bless our country. Thank you for coming.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringthe2011superbowlchampiongreenbaypackers", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. Hello, everybody. Everybody, have a seat. On [DATE], I want to welcome everybody to [FAC]. Thank you all for being here. I am just going to come out and say it: This hurts a little bit. This is a hard thing for a [ORG] fan to do. It does not hurt as much as the NFC Championship Game hurt but it still hurts, you guys coming to my house to rub it in. What are you going to do, go to [PERSON]'s house next or . But in the interest of good sportsmanship, congratulations to [ORG] on your 4th Super Bowl championship and record 13th [ORG] championship. Oh, you know, the problem you have, though, in your franchiseyour fans are not that enthusiastic. You guys have got to work on that. I am surprised they are not wearing cheeseheads. Oh, there they are. All right, my mistake. Look, obviously, it is good to have football right around the corner. Like every football fan, I was thrilled to have the lockout ended. Nobody likes long, frustrating negotiations with a rigid opposition, taking it to the brink. I want to recognize [ORG] President [PERSON], GM [PERSON], for the outstanding job they have done, as well as Coach [PERSON] for guiding them to the next championship. And I would like to welcome all the players to [ORG]; some of them I have had a chance to meet before, wonderful guys. I guess I especially have to welcome [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? [At this point, cornerback [PERSON] approached the podium.] [SPEAKER]. See, hold on [TIME]. I was not asking for some certificate you are about to give me, are not you? He is really rubbing it in. Look at that. Now, look, I admit [PERSON] is a pretty good ballplayer. And for those who do not know, I gave [PERSON] a little bulletin board material, apparently, [DATE]. And so after the [ORG] beat the [ORG], [PERSON] addressed the teameverybody on [ORG] saw it; I saw it while I was working out in the morningand [PERSON] said, If [SPEAKER] does not want to come to watch us at the Super Bowl, then we are going to him. Then I flew to [GPE] [DATE] to visit a local company, and Governor [PERSON] and Mayor [PERSON]'s Mayor [PERSON]? There he is right there. He gave me a jersey from [PERSON] on which he'd written, See you at [FAC]. So basically, [PERSON] has been giving me a hard time now for [DATE]. [PERSON], you are a man of your word. And I have now learned something that every [ORG] quarterback already knows too well: Do not mess with [PERSON]. Now, in the Super Bowl, the [ORG] showed just what a championship team is made of and that you deserved those rings Coach [PERSON] had you fitted on [TIME] before. The game was a lot like your season. Some key players went down with injuries in the first [CARDINAL], including [PERSON] and [PERSON]. But everybody stepped up. Your offense exploded behind one of the greatest performances by a quarterback in a Super Bowl. Where is [PERSON]? Your defense was flying all over the place like [PERSON] hair. Where is [PERSON]? There he is. And you brought the Lombardi Trophy back home. [PERSON] earned the game's MVP award: [QUANTITY], [CARDINAL] touchdowns, no interceptions. This was a performance that capped off an incredible playoff run that proved he is not just one of the best quarterbacks in the game, he is one of the best quarterbacks perhaps of all time. And I know that he is going to be having an extraordinary career going forward. We also know that the [ORG] are made of [CARDINAL] player or [CARDINAL] season. They are made of the people of [GPE]. Back in [DATE], fans passed the hat at the games to support the team. In [DATE], after [DATE], local businessmen banded together to pay the bills. [CARDINAL] more timesin [DATE] and 1950the community came to the rescue to keep the club afloat, and [DATE], [CARDINAL] people own a piece of this franchise. It is the only publicly owned team in pro sports, so[applause]. And after the Super Bowl, [CARDINAL] of those fans woke up [DATE], put on their snow boots, and headed over to [FAC] to shovel it out for the victory pep rally. That support goes both ways. The [ORG] have raised [MONEY] for charities in communities all across [GPE] and [GPE]. [CARDINAL] schools participate in the [ORG] program to promote childhood health. They have given scholarships to local students, sponsored food and blood drives, found creative ways to support our troops and their families. So even a [ORG] fan can admit that the relationship between [GPE] and its team is something special. It reflects those old-school, small-town values of community and hard work that have always defined what it meant to be an [NORP]. And Super Bowl spotlight or not, that is something that is alive in towns across this country [DATE]. So to all the [GPE] [ORG], to all the fans, congratulations. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because [ORG] fans have [CARDINAL] dates circled on our calendars: [DATE] and Sunday Night Football on [DATE]. And if you guys are on a roll by then, just keep in mind that there is [CARDINAL] placeone person here who can ground all planes in and out of [GPE] if he has to. So congratulations. [PERSON], what do you got here? You can step up to the mike. Mr. [PERSON]. Well, on behalf of the [ORG] organization and all the players, we would like to present you with this. Of course, all the fans own the team, and it hurts us a little bit to give you this as well but to give you shares of [ORG]. [[SPEAKER] was presented with a framed share of stock.] [SPEAKER]. Man, that is outstanding. Thewell, if I am a part owner, I think . Coach [PERSON]. We figured this is the only way we could get you away from the [ORG]. [SPEAKER]. No, what I am thinking is, I think we should initiate a trade to send [PERSON] down to the [ORG]. Audience members. Boo! [SPEAKER]. What do you think? No? How about Mr. [PERSON]. A minority owner, thank you. Coach [PERSON]. [PERSON], go ahead. [SPEAKER]. All right, what else we got? Quarterback [PERSON]. On behalf of the team, we also want to give you the right colors to wear on those [CARDINAL] dates you mentioned. We got you this jersey, right here. [[SPEAKER] was presented with a team jersey bearing the words Commander in Chief. ] [SPEAKER]. All right, man. Thank you. Commander in Chief. Mr. [PERSON]. Why do not you change into that right now? [SPEAKER]. Thank you. Good to see you, man. Absolutely. All right. Let us get a good picture. They are going to break this down.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringthepointslightinstitute0", "text": "It is a well-kept secret -- I did not know this was about me. But thank you all very much, and thank you, [PERSON], for those very kind and extraordinarily generous remarks. I particularly want to thank the President and the First Lady for opening up [FAC], and for keeping the spirit of volunteerism alive and well. Service to others, he believes and I believe, we all believe -- and I have to be the most biased person in this room, but I think this President and this First Lady have done an extraordinary job in taking this concept forward. I want to thank [PERSON] and [PERSON] -- where is [PERSON]? Right here. Quiet -- she is not -- normally not that way. And [PERSON]. The amount they have done for this cause is just hard to quantify. It is just wonderful. As much as [DATE] also marks [DATE] since we started a nationwide movement to mobilize citizens, and all backgrounds and all walks, to help their fellow man, let me thank those who were present at the creation -- from our fearless leader here at [FAC] in [PERSON], who was singled out [TIME] -- and our founding board members, of course, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And I see so many others here who have done so very much for this cause. Once we were out of the gate, a number of talented people, including [PERSON] -- is [PERSON] here? Not here. There is the man, there he is -- joined the fight and helped keep the fire burning and our cause moving forward and touching more lives. And now, most importantly, we have [CARDINAL] capable leaders stepping forward to head the [ORG] hands-on network, and they are, as you have heard -- a distinguished [NORP], [PERSON] -- [PERSON] and [PERSON], my son -- our son. And they have our full faith and confidence, and we are very fortunate they are doing the job and just pushing, putting in all the time in volunteer fashion. Of course, [PERSON] and [PERSON] and the entire [ORG] team cannot do the important work by themselves. They need the support and inspiration of the corporate and civic leaders in this room. And there are countless more around the country, I might add. This is nationwide. And I think they are getting it. But let me thank each and every one of you for adding your leadership and your vision to this nationwide, vital cause. In the final analysis, the same realities, the same truths that led us to set this shared movement in motion [DATE] remain unchanged. And we still believe in the innate propensity of the [NORP] people to reach out beyond themselves to help others. That is what this is really all about. We still believe there is nothing wrong with [GPE] that cannot be fixed by what is right with [GPE]. And we are here to affirm once more that from now on in [GPE], there can be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others. I know the idea behind this event was to honor what our administration started, but speaking for my team, the honor was all ours. And that is the way it is when you engage in community service. The satisfaction of knowing that you have made a difference is indeed the greatest reward. Of course, there is still so much to do. So let me simply close by encouraging our new leadership, all on the team, to get out there and keep fighting away. I may not be able to suit up again and get out on the field with you like I would want to, but the Lord knows I will be there with you in spirit every step of the way. And thank you all for being here. Thank you all for your support for this concept of volunteerism, helping others. It is a great thing.

Thanks for letting me come by to say hello. Shall we get started? Teacher [PERSON]. Boys and girls, we have a very special guest [TIME]. We are honored [TIME] to have [SPEAKER] here with us in our classroom, and he will be reading a story to us [TIME]. He is here on his visit to promote reading. [SPEAKER]. I am here to promote reading. Thanks for letting me come by and read. First, I want to introduce the Secretary of Education, Dr. [PERSON]. He is a friend of mine. I knew [PERSON] in [GPE]. He and I were from [GPE]. And I asked him to come up and become the Secretary of Education because he did such a fine job of being the superintendent of schools in [GPE]. And we are all speaking about superintendents we have got the superintendent of the [GPE], [GPE], schools with us, Dr. [PERSON]. Superintendent [PERSON]. [TIME], boys and girls. Students. [TIME]. [SPEAKER]. Thanks for having us here at [ORG]. I am so glad to see your principal, Ms. [PERSON]. She is a pretty special person, is not she? One of the things that happens when you get [DATE] and I am [DATE] is you have trouble seeing. [Laughter] So in order for me to read this book called More Than Anything Else, I had to put on my glasses. This is also [DATE]. And what is important about [DATE] is to read about different heroes who have made a difference in making history and to realize there are fantastic role models. So this is a combination of history plus reading. So thanks for letting me come by. [CARDINAL] reason I like to highlight reading is, reading is the beginnings of the ability to be a good student. And if you cannot read, it is going to be hard to realize dreams; it is going to be hard to go to college. So when your teachers say, read, you ought to listen to her. Ms. [PERSON]. Thank you. [SPEAKER]. Also, I hope you read more than you watch TV. That is pretty hard. Does anybody do that, read more than they watch TV? [Laughter] It is good to read more than you watch TV. That is how you learn, and it is very important to practice. Are you ready to go? Students. Yes. [SPEAKER]. Has anybody read this book yet? Students. No. [SPEAKER]. And that is the end of the story. And the story is about a young fellow who grew up very poor and worked really hard. But he knew something. He knew, if he learned to read, he could change his life. I think it is a great story, do not you? Students. Yes. [SPEAKER]. It is a story that teaches the power of reading and what it means. So that is what is important, to be able to read, because you can read somebody else's experiences too, and you can share. And this is the story of an unbelievable young man who became a great reader and a great leader. So thanks for having me come. Anybody got any questions? Ms. [PERSON]. [SPEAKER], we have a tradition here in our classroom that whenever we read a book we have a reading chain here in our classroom. In each book we write the title and the author, and we'd be honored if you would join us in our reading chain by adding that book to our reading chain. [SPEAKER]. I will do that. Thanks for letting me do that. Good to see everybody. Ms. [PERSON]. All right. Thank you so much, and we will add that. [SPEAKER]. I am going to leave this here for you, too, as a gift. Ms. [PERSON]. Okay. Thank you so much. [SPEAKER]. Thanks, I appreciate it. Ms. [PERSON]. And we will add this, boys and girls, to the end of our chain. And [SPEAKER] has signed it, More Than Anything Else. [SPEAKER]. How about that? It is pretty nice, is not it? Thanks for having me come. One of the reasons I came is, I think it is important for the [ORG] to stay focused on public education and public education reforms. [CARDINAL] of the key ingredients in our package we sent up to the [ORG] is a reading initiative. I am so impressed about what Ms. [PERSON] is doing at this school, what the superintendent is insisting upon accountability-based reading system. And she told me that they have got a collaborative effort here with [ORG], which has developed curriculum based upon the science of reading. And it is impressive that the school and the [GPE] are willing to set high standards and ask the fundamental question, what works in education; are willing to implement curriculum that works; and then are willing to be held accountable for implementing the curriculum. And thank you for letting me come. I appreciate you coming. Q. [SPEAKER], would you be interested in establishing a panel along the vein of what President [PERSON] did, to look into racial profiling, or perhaps considering an Executive order banning racial profiling? [SPEAKER]. I will look at all opportunities, starting with the gathering of information, where [ORG] can help jurisdictions, gather information, compile information to get the facts on the table to make sure that people are treated fairly in the justice system. Q. [SPEAKER], do you have any of agreeing to the [ORG]'s request that you increase your defense spending, your defense budget, or give a supplemental for [DATE]? [SPEAKER]. I have sent the message that I think it is very important for us to not have an early supplemental. Secondly, Secretary [PERSON] is beginning a review of the defense, a top to bottom review of what is happening in [DATE]'s military, reviewing missions, reviewing opportunities for change, beginning to look at the transformation policy. And I will look forward to finding out what his report says. I will be traveling the country [DATE], talking about some increases in the defense spending, along the lines of what I promised during the course of the campaign, starting with better pay for the men and women who wear the uniform. Q. But they are saying it is going to affect military readiness. [SPEAKER]. What is going to affect military Q. They are saying that they need more money excuse me they are not going to be able to be prepared for [SPEAKER]. Well, that is part of the review process. I hear there are a lot of voices on a lot of subjects regarding the budget. We have yet to submit our budget; I will, later on. But I have said during the campaign, I have said since I have been sworn in, it is important for us to do a topto-bottom review, to review all missions, spending priorities, and that is exactly what the Secretary of [ORG] is going to do. And before people jump to conclusions, I think it is important to get that review finished. Q. What about [ORG]? Are you asking for specific cuts in? [SPEAKER]. We are looking at all we have asked our Secretaries on all Cabinets to take a review of their full budgets, and we will submit a budget here later on. [ORG] Q. [SPEAKER], on the subject of [ORG], there are still some misunderstanding about whether there is going to be an AIDS czar, like [SPEAKER]. Well, there is going to be a focus on AIDS, and people can apply any title they want. But there is going to be a person in my office who has got the responsibility of coordinating the AIDS policy throughout [ORG]. Q. What did you say to Mr. [PERSON]? [SPEAKER]. Oh, I had a good talk with Mr. [PERSON]. I have also had talks with other leaders throughout the region, and I urged calm. I said it was very important to give the newly elected leader of [GPE] a chance, a chance to form a government and a chance to do what he said he wanted to do, which is to promote the peace in the region. And I certainly hope that people recognize that change does not necessarily mean that the peace process will not go forward. I think we ought to take Mr. [PERSON] for his word, and that is, he wants to promote peace in the Middle East. I look forward to watching him put a government together and then fulfilling what he said he would do. Q. Are you concerned about the violence [DATE], the bombings? [SPEAKER]. I am concerned about all kinds of violence. But I firmly believe that the best policy is to encourage leaders to just remain resolute in their willingness to promote the peace and give the [PERSON] government a chance to form a government and then to be able to do what he said he wanted to do, which is to promote peace in the Middle East.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksluncheonforrepresentativewilliamjjeffersonneworleans", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I have had [DATE] here. I do not think I have ever had a bad day in [GPE]. [Laughter] And I am honored to be here with [PERSON] and [PERSON], with [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And [PERSON], you have done a lot of great things in your life, but you have not given many better talks. That was very, very good. I am honored to be here with your bright young mayor, who has established such a fine record and has recently joined the ranks of the happily married. [Laughter] We are proud of him for that, too. Let me say to all of you-I was just sitting here listening to what everybody else was saying, wondering if I could offer any unique perspective. I first came to [GPE] [DATE]. I hate that. [Laughter] I was just a little boy. My mother was in nursing school here. And one of the most vivid memories of my lifetime was seeing my mother kneel by the side of the railroad tracks and cry when I went home with my grandmother, because she had been widowed early, before my father-before I was born. My father died [DATE] before I was born. And she came down here to get some education so she could support me. I came back here when I was [DATE] and a budding musician. [Laughter] And they would not let me in anyplace to hear anybody-[laughter]- because I was so young. And I saw-I never will forget this-I was walking away from my mother, and I saw [PERSON] sitting there in some big [NORP] limousine, reading a newspaper, and he was going to go in and perform. I knocked on his window, told him who I was, and said I had come all the way down here from [GPE], [GPE], and all I cared about was music. I did not want to drink anything; I did not want to gamble; I did not want anything; I just wanted to go hear him play. He took me in and put me on the front table. It is funny what you remember, is not it? I have never forgotten that, and that sort of embodies the generosity that the people of this city and this State have exhibited to me throughout my life. And you did give [PERSON] and me, [PERSON] and [PERSON], and our administration the electoral votes of the people of [GPE] twice, and I am profoundly grateful for that. I want to say [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] things I think you ought to think about in this election. When I became President, I ran a long, hard campaign. I was written off for dead [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] times along the way, and [CARDINAL] times since. [Laughter] But [PERSON] was one of my first supporters. I remember the first time I came here, when the [PERSON] had me in their home. I met their beautiful, brilliant daughters, and their family members, many of whom are here [DATE]. The Congressman's father is here, mother-in-law is here, many others here. And we went through that campaign, and I found that, to a remarkable degree, we shared the same philosophy. We were proud members of [ORG], but we did not like the fact that our party had been a part of the leadership of [DATE] of [NORP] Presidents when we had the majority in the [ORG], and together they quadrupled the debt of the country; and that we were in a terrible recession. Interest rates were high. Unemployment was high. Wages had been stagnant for [DATE]. We did not like the fact that people thought because we believed in the United States Constitution and we were against racial discrimination, that somehow we were soft on crime or we thought able-bodied people should not work instead of being on welfare. We thought that [ORG], and [NORP] in general, had been twisted and distorted and used as political whipping boys in campaigns. And we thought [ORG] was divided by gridlock, and we wanted a change. So I said, give me a chance to change [GPE], to change the direction of the country, change our party, to change our leadership in [GPE]. I have a simple philosophy: I want [GPE] in [DATE] to be a place where every person, without regard to race, creed, gender, or anything else, has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I want [GPE] to be a place where we are all coming together, not being driven apart. And I want [GPE] to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and justice and prosperity. And my strategy for getting there is to do everything I know how to do to give opportunity for all, demand responsibility from all [NORP], and create a community of all [NORP]. That is what we said we'd do. Now, in [DATE], it was an argument. And the people decided to give me a chance, even though I was, in the rather disparaging characterization of the incumbent President, just a Governor from a small southern [GPE]. [Laughter] The people decided to give me a chance. They bought our side of the argument. By [DATE], there was no argument anymore because the results were beginning to pour in. And now, in [DATE], I can look back and say with gratitude and thanks and humility that it has worked out. The results speak for themselves. We have the longest peacetime expansion in history; [CARDINAL] jobs; the lowest unemployment rate in [DATE]; the lowest welfare rate in [DATE]; the lowest crime rate in [DATE]. [DATE] I announced that this [DATE]'s surplus will be [MONEY], the first time in [DATE] we have had a surplus [DATE]. And I say that to make this point-and along the way, by the way, with the [ORG] scholarship and other financial incentives, we have opened the doors of college to virtually every [NORP]. The air is cleaner; the water is cleaner; the food is safer; [PERCENT] of our kids are immunized against serious childhood diseases for the first time; [CARDINAL] young [NORP] have served in [ORG] in their communities all over this country, including this one, and earned some money for college. And we have been a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. And I am proud of that. What is that got to do with this? Well, I will just give you a few examples. And what is that got to do with the Governor's race, even if it has something to do with our record? And I will give you a few examples of that. Number one, all this started with [CARDINAL] vote in [DATE]. The economy started getting better after the election, as soon as I announced my economic plan. But it did not get voted on in [ORG] until [DATE], because it was fairly controversial. I had cut [CARDINAL] of programs but dramatically increased education. And I asked the wealthiest [NORP] to pay more taxes, and cut taxes on [CARDINAL] [NORP] who were working for modest wages, lower wages, with children in their home. And there was a lot of controversy, and [ORG] in [ORG] decided that they would vote against this to the person, that they would not give me [CARDINAL] vote, and that they would tell everybody it was a just a tax increase, even though they knew only a tiny fraction of [NORP] were going to have one. Now, that bill passed by [CARDINAL] vote in [ORG], [PERSON] vote. And it passed by [CARDINAL] vote in [ORG]. If [PERSON] had not voted for that, it would not have happened, the recovery probably would not have occurred, and none of us would probably be standing here [DATE] doing this. So I am grateful to [PERSON]. I am grateful to him for supporting our agenda to reach out to other countries-to Latin America, to Africa-to expand trade of [NORP] products, to build up [FAC], to bring us closer to other people in other countries. I am grateful to [PERSON] for supporting the anticrime agenda that Mayor [PERSON] talks about all the time: Get guns out of the wrong hands; put more community police on the street; give our kids something good to do. And I am grateful to [PERSON] for supporting my education agenda every step of the way, including our plan to hire [CARDINAL] 000 more teachers to get class size down in the early grades, something he is running on; our plan to build or modernize [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] schools, which would include his commitment to air-condition the schools that do not have it; our plan to triple the number of our young people who are eligible for after-school programs; set high standards for failing schools, and if they do not turn around, let the parents go to another public school with their kid, but help the schools turn around. We can do that. I have seen that all over [GPE]. I am telling you, I have been in the schools in the worst neighborhoods you can imagine in terms of adversity, and I have seen children learning at a high level because of what was done in the school. So, yes, I am grateful to [PERSON]. And a lot of what we enjoy [DATE] came as a direct result of policies he supported that he played a critical role in bringing to bear. The second point I'd like to make to you is that I believe I am the only person in this room who has actually been a Governor. I know something about this. [Laughter] And I did it quite a long time. I served [DATE]. I served for [DATE] and would have served for [DATE] if the people had not elected me President. [Laughter] And I am telling you, I loved [DATE] of it. It is a wonderful job if you love people and if you care about good schools, good jobs, and creating strong, healthy, vibrant communities. We have done more in the education area probably than any administration, certainly since the [PERSON] administration. But most of the money for schools and most of the direction for schools, by [ORG] constitutional law, comes from the [ORG], in every State in [GPE]. So it is very important. You know, education is very important to me, personally, and to [PERSON] and to all of our administration. But the President has to protect the [NORP] people in many ways; the national security has to come first, and then you have to deal with a whole range of other issues. But a Governor has no more important job, none, than education. And a Governor also has to be able to get people together to really get things done. What you want in a Governor is somebody who is smart, committed, with a good heart, who is passionate about what he or she believes but is not particularly partisan. And I can tell you, [PERSON] and I-we all came out of [ORG]; he and I both did. We are both, frankly, mortified by how partisan that crowd is in [GPE]. [Laughter] I mean, I always tell him there is plenty of things for us to argue about in the next election, but the people give us a paycheck [DATE] to show up for work in the meanwhile. And we are not supposed to fight about everything; we are supposed to work out things and get things done. That is the sort of person he is. And he has a lot of friends in the [ORG] who are [NORP] because they know that he has not responded in kind to the harsh partisanship of their leaders and that he is still willing to work with people of good will to get things done. You cannot be a good Governor unless you are both open to people in both parties but absolutely aggressive in what you believe and what you want to achieve. You need both an agenda and an ability to bring people together. He can do that. And I did this for [DATE]; I am telling you, this is important, and he can do it superbly well. The other thing that has not been mentioned-[PERSON] talked about his service in the legislature-he was twice voted, twice, the best member of [ORG]. So he knows about this job. The last thing I will say is this, and I think it is important. I want to thank [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON] for having us in this magnificent facility. But this facility used to be an orphanage, and I got to thinking, [PERSON] and I had a very moving event at [FAC] [DATE] to celebrate our attempts to move people, kids from foster care into adoption, and all the work we have done over [DATE]-[CARDINAL] thing we have done, by the way, on a bipartisan basis-to speed up adoptions. And I got down here [DATE], and when I was over at the school, a woman stopped me and said, Mr. President, thank you for helping to fix the adoption laws. I just adopted [CARDINAL] children. So we have worked on this. Now, I want to say that I want you to think about this as a place where children once lived who had no family. This man knows what it is like to have a difficult time. He knows what it is like to have the support of a good family. He knows what it is like to build a good family, and he and his wife have [CARDINAL] magnificent daughters who have done superbly well because they have good parents and a good home. In the end, having now served [DATE] as a Governor and [DATE] as President, I can tell you, a lot of times you have to make decisions that nobody is smart enough to make. A lot of times decisions come to me that, no matter how smart I think I am, I cannot think my way through. And all you can do is pray to God to give you the wisdom to do it, and listen to your heart, not your head. So the last thing I will say is, remember everything-the man has proven he is had the courage to take a tough decision. He cast a decisive vote on the most important bill that brought us the prosperity we enjoy [DATE]. He has wide experience in State Government. He has the capacity to get people together. He clearly has the right agenda. There is no more important agenda for [GPE]'s future than getting the education up to world-class levels. But when it is all said and done, what really counts is, do you have a good heart. Keep in mind, [DATE] I still remember my mother loved me enough to kneel down on those railroad tracks and cry when I had to go away. When it is all said and done, you do not remember first and foremost in the last moments of your life the honors you had, the riches you had; you remember who you liked and who you loved, how it felt when the seasons changed, and what it felt like to be really, really important, to matter in the lives of other people. The people of [GPE] will matter to [PERSON] if he is the Governor. I agree with what has been said. You should only vote for him if you think he'd be the best Governor. But if you think he'd be the best Governor and you let him be defeated, it would be a terrible thing, because the children here, the children of this State deserve the very best person they can get in experience, in mind, and in heart. Thank you. God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmajorappointmentsthedepartmenttransportation", "text": "The purpose of this particular appearance is to present not only the Secretary of [ORG], but also so that he can meet with you and introduce some of the major appointments in that agency. These appointments I consider to be especially important to the new administration because the field of transportation offers some of our gravest problems and some of our most exciting opportunities. We have just had a meeting in my office on these problems and I emphasized my concern that [GPE] look way ahead in transportation--so that looking ahead [DATE] from now we are not all living on freeways--looking ahead and recognizing that the problems that we see in our great cities here are reflected around the world. I pointed out that I noted that whether you were in [GPE], in [GPE], in [GPE] or [GPE], let alone the great cities here-[GPE], [GPE], [GPE]--the massive problems of traffic jams choking the cities with traffic and choking the people with smog, that looking at this present problem, if we do not plan for the future we are going to reap some terrible consequences. What is very encouraging to me is that the team that Secretary [PERSON] has assembled is made up of men who are thinking about these problems and are not here simply to administer the existing programs, administering the highway program and the others in the same fashion that they have been administered. We need some new approaches. For that reason I have directed the Secretary to prepare a major report on transportation and a policy for the future. That will not come [DATE], and it will not come in [DATE] or [DATE]. We hope that within [DATE] .that report will be available so that we can do some advance planning. In addition, the Secretary will be able to answer some questions [DATE] on the SST and other problems in which you may be interested. I did want to appear with the group because of the importance of the assignments that they will undertake, and I think we have some high-quality men who have a vision about the future and are not simply going to try to administer the programs of the past.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingwithamericanindianleaders", "text": "Secretary [PERSON], let me welcome each and every one of you to [FAC] [TIME]. I am extremely happy to have the opportunity to meet with you individually as well as collectively, and I am very proud to have the distinguished leaders and the elected representatives of [GPE]'s [NORP] tribes here in [FAC] of [FAC]. I looked over your schedule and I hope from the distinguished speakers that spoke with you that you have had an informative briefing session, not only with Secretary [PERSON] but the others--those who were responsible for some of the [ORG] [NORP] programs. I think it is vitally important that you tell us what your problems are, what your needs are, and then we can be fully informed as to the right policies and the right programs. Let me take [TIME] to talk with you on a personal basis, to let you know of my personal concern for the needs of [NORP] and [NORP]. [ORG] has a very unique relationship with you and your people. It is a relationship of a legal trust and a high moral responsibility. That relationship is rooted deep in history, but it is fed [DATE] by our concern that the [NORP] people should enjoy the same opportunities as other [NORP], while maintaining the culture and the traditions that you rightly prize as your heritage. That heritage is an important part of the [NORP] culture that we are celebrating in this great country in [DATE]. Your contribution has been both material and spiritual. Your ancestors introduced settlers not only to new foods and new plants but to [NORP] ways of life and [NORP] values which they absorbed. This is [DATE] for all of us to realize what a great debt we individually and collectively owe to [NORP]. [DATE] you are concerned about such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, crime, poor health, and unsuitable housing on [NORP] reservations. I share your concern. I am hopeful about the future and about what we can achieve by continuing to work together. [DATE] have brought a new era in [NORP] affairs. In [DATE], [ORG] policy has vacillated between paternalism and the threat of terminating [ORG] responsibility. I am opposed to both extremes. I believe in maintaining a stable policy so that [NORP] and [NORP] leaders can plan and work confidently for the future. We can build on that foundation to improve the opportunities available to [NORP] and, at the same time, make it possible for you to live as you choose within your tribal structure and in brotherhood with your fellow citizens. We have already begun to build. My administration is supporting the concept of allowing [NORP] tribes to determine whether they and their members, in addition to being under tribal jurisdiction, should be under [ORG] or [ORG] civil and criminal jurisdiction. I have directed [ORG] and [ORG] to draft legislation which would accomplish this goal efficiently, effectively, and within adequate guidelines. They have solicited the views of the [NORP] community in preparing their recommendations, which I will soon send to the [ORG]. I am committed to furthering the self-determination of [NORP] communities but without terminating the special relationship between [ORG] and the [NORP] people. I am strongly opposed to termination. Self-determination means that you can decide the nature of your tribe's relationship with [ORG] within the framework of the Self-Determination Act, which I signed in [DATE]. [NORP] tribes, if they desire, now have the opportunity to administer [ORG] programs for themselves. We can then work together as partners. On your part, this requires initiative and responsibility as you define your tribal goals and determine how you want to use the [ORG] resources. On [ORG] part, self-determination for [NORP] tribes requires that [ORG] programs must be flexible enough to deal with the different needs and desires of individual tribes. In the past, our flexibility has been limited by the lack of effective coordination among departments and agencies offering a wide variety of programs and services to the [NORP] people. Programs serving both reservation and nonreservation [NORP] are spread across [CARDINAL] different [ORG] departments involving agencies ranging from [ORG] to [ORG]. As many of you know, this is [PERSON] last day on the [ORG] staff. [PERSON]'s service as [ORG] Liaison for Indian Affairs has been invaluable to me as [SPEAKER] and to the [ORG] officers and, I am confident, to the [NORP] community. With his departure, I will announce shortly the name of a person who will assume [PERSON] duties in [ORG] in the area of [NORP] affairs. This appointee will be an individual with responsibility to work with the [ORG] officers, with [ORG], with [ORG], and with my legal office to encourage the improved coordination of the various [ORG] agencies and programs that currently serve the [NORP] population. As an additional step in this direction, I am also sending a memorandum to the heads of all [ORG] departments with [NORP] responsibilities, directing them to give priority attention to the coordination of [NORP] programs. These [CARDINAL] actions will help to ensure that [MONEY] spent [DATE] on [NORP] programs and services will be spent efficiently, with cooperation, and without duplication. An important task we can help you with is the challenge of economic development of your lands. I congratulate you on the initiative that you have shown. I pledge encouragement. I pledge help in your efforts to create long-term economic development. Many [NORP] reservations contain valuable natural resources. There must be the proper treatment of these resources with respect for nature, which is a traditional [NORP] value. My Attorney General has established an [NORP] resources section whose sole responsibility is litigation on behalf of [NORP] tribes to protect your natural resources and your jurisdictional rights. [NORP] leaders and the [NORP] people have gained an increasing skill in managing these resources so they benefit your tribes and our [ORG] as a whole. I wholeheartedly and unequivocally pledge our cooperation in working with you to improve the quality of [NORP] life by providing soundly managed programs and a stable policy. We can make the 'rest of [DATE] [DATE] in the lives of the [NORP] people. Together, we can write a new chapter in the history of this land that we all serve and this land that we all share.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalsecurityadvisorcondoleezzariceterrorismandforeignpolicy", "text": "AboutSearch DR. [PERSON]: Thank you very much. It is a great honor to be here at [ORG]. I have been fortunate to count a lot of [ORG] graduates and [ORG] faculty among my friends, indeed, I see many friends and colleagues in the audience. Thanks for being here. This is a place that is synonymous with professionalism, with hard work and with influence on the important issues of foreign and defense policy around the world. I have been told that this speech is also being broadcast live on the worldwide web, and so for those of you who are sitting in your offices or your home, or even at a classroom in [GPE] or in [GPE], welcome, and thanks for taking the time to tune in. I'd like to thank [PERSON] very much, the Interim Dean of [ORG], for the opportunity to be here. [PERSON], the Dean Designate and a good friend; congratulations on your recent appointment, [PERSON]. To [PERSON], the President of [ORG], and his wife, [PERSON], who leave this university so very, very well, thank you. To [PERSON] and [PERSON], the widow and son of [PERSON], thank you for sponsoring this lecture. As a former provost, I know how important it is to have that kind of support. To [PERSON] and his wife, [PERSON], it is an honor to have you here. Not only are you good friends, but [PERSON], your [DATE] of service and your visionary work in containing [GPE] and giving [GPE] a vision that was transformative and that was realized [DATE] is something that [PERSON] has perhaps put best, that wise men come and wise men go, but [CARDINAL] wise man goes on and on. And, [PERSON], we are very glad for that. [PERSON], also a former National Security Advisor -- we have a little club that we hold. [PERSON], it is nice to have you here. And to [PERSON], who is a good friend and a graduate of [ORG], as well to the members of [ORG], thank you very much for this opportunity. As [PERSON] said, I was originally scheduled to be here on [DATE], and I thought I would speaking. Instead, I ended up, after [TIME] in a [ORG] bunker, trying to deal with the effects of a huge terrorist attack on [GPE]. None of us will ever forget where we were when we heard the news [DATE]. I, myself, was standing at my desk in [FAC], and I was waiting to go down to my senior staff meeting, when my executive assistant handed me a note that said that a plane had hit [FAC]. And my first thought was, what a terrible accident. And I called the President and he said essentially the same thing, he was in [GPE], he said, what a terrible accident. And, of course, first reports are always wrong. First we thought it was a twin engine plane, and then later we learned it was a commercial airliner. And I went down for my senior staff meeting and [CARDINAL] people into the staff meeting, as I was asking for reports, I got a note from my executive assistant that said a second plane has hit [FAC]. And I thought, my God, it is a terrorist attack. And I walked into [FAC] to try to gather together the national security principals for a session, a meeting, and I was trying to reach [PERSON] and I could not . And I looked behind me, and a plane had hit the [ORG]. And there were reports that there were car bombs at [ORG] and that airplanes were headed for [FAC]. It is one of those events that foreign policy professionals spend their lives talking about and thinking about and studying -- and perhaps even exercising for, as I am one who believes in teaching from decision simulations -- but you hope to God that you will never actually face it. Indeed, we did face it, as a country and as a world. In the [TIME] and [DATE] that followed, the President set the broad outlines of a strategy to address what had happened to us. And, of course, as a part of that, he ordered the [ORG] to quickly develop a military strategy for [GPE], which was obviously the center, the home base from which this attack had taken place. Now, that plan was truly outside the box for the simple reason that the [NORP] military did not have on the shelf a plan that said: your ground forces will be on horseback, but they will be complemented by [DATE] air power. It took a little, shall we say, adaptive planning to figure out exactly how to make that work. But we quickly did adapt to the new conditions that faced us. And the President, who wanted to use [GPE]'s military forces deliberately but decisively, was able to do so. The results speak for themselves: [ORG] has been deprived of its home base; its leadership is on the run; many of its operatives have been captured or killed; the [ORG] regime has been routed; [GPE] has been transformed from a terrorist-sponsored state into a country led by people who are trying to create a better future. There remains much work to be done on many fronts, from military operations to law enforcement to intelligence sharing to cutting off terrorist financing. The war on terrorism has many aspects, not just military aspects, and we are pursuing them all. Patient and focused leadership has brought us thus far, and we believe that it will carry us through to victory. It is going to take [DATE] to understand the long-term effects of September 11th. But even now we are beginning to recognize that there are certain verities that September 11th reinforced and brought home to us in the most vivid way. First, there has been an end to innocence about international politics and about our own vulnerability. We see that wars of consequence are not mere relics of a bygone era. We see that in [DATE] to come the primary energies of [GPE]'s [ORG] will be devoted to more than just managing civil conflict and humanitarian assistance. As the world's most powerful nation, [GPE] has a special responsibility to help make the world more secure. And when we were attacked on [DATE], it reinforced one of the rediscovered truths about [DATE]'s world: robust military power matters in international politics and in security. Second, the events of September 11th underscored the idea that a sound foreign policy begins at home. We are now engaged in trying to harden the country. That means thinking about airport security, visa requirements, protection of nuclear power plants and other physical and cyber security infrastructure. We also are working with [ORG] to make certain that the role of [GPE]'s [ORG], in defending our territory, our airspace, our land and our sea, is properly taken care of. And that is why Secretary [PERSON] and Chairman [PERSON] have proposed the creation of [ORG] -- having [GPE]'s Armed Forces cover for the first time the [NORP] continent, wholly consistent with [NORP] constitutional responsibilities and expectations, but with a new understanding that [GPE]'s frontiers need to be safe. In doing so, we recognize that we have to secure our own neighborhood, not just [GPE]'s borders. And we are now cooperating with [GPE] and [GPE] in unprecedented ways to construct smart and modern borders -- borders that protect us from those who would harm us, but facilitate the trade and human interchange that enrich us. Since [DATE] of the campaign for President, President [PERSON] has stated his determination to build a fully democratic western hemisphere that lives and trades in freedom and grows in prosperity. Strong, prosperous neighbors export their goods, not their problems -- like drugs and terror. The third truth is that we can only do so much to protect ourselves at home, and so the best defense is a good offense. We have to take the fight to the terrorists. And that means that there can be no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. So in addition to pursuing [ORG], we have also pursued the [ORG] and the government of [GPE], as we knew that they had shared responsibilities for the terrorist attacks. Now with the [ORG] out of power and [ORG] damaged, we have moved into the second stage of our war on terror. But let us be very clear: much remains to be done in [GPE]. Ultimately, [GPE] will be secured by more democracy and more prosperity. This great project is not [GPE]'s alone and it will require a broad range of tools. We need to help [GPE] build up its political institutions, its economic institutions and its civil society. Building a nation is not an [NORP] military task -- it is a joint project, a long-term project between the [NORP] people and the international community. Beyond [GPE], we are engaged in a sustained campaign to deny sanctuary to terrorists, regardless of where they are from and where they commit their crimes. Our message to every leader on every continent is that terrorism can support no cause, it is never, never legitimate; it is, by its very nature, evil; terrorists have no positive agenda; terrorists are not for anything, they are against peace and freedom and life, itself. Recent events in the Middle East illustrate the terrible damage, the terrible toll of terrorism. Innocent lives are being lost. People who could be living together in peace are being driven apart by death and destruction. And on [DATE], the President called on all parties -- [GPE], the [NORP] and regional leaders among the [NORP] neighbors -- to accept their responsibilities to create an environment free from violence and terror. A fourth truth that [DATE] underscored was the need to deny terrorists and hostile states the opportunity to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The world's most dangerous people simply cannot be permitted to obtain the world's most dangerous weapons. And it is a stubborn and extremely troubling fact that the list of states that sponsor terror and the lists of states that are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction overlap substantially. We do not see how these facts can be denied. And if these facts are admitted, they must be confronted. We must use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat, including strengthened nonproliferation regimes and export controls, and moving ahead with missile defense to deny any benefit to those who would try and acquire weapons of mass destruction. [GPE] and our coalition partners must act deliberately. But inaction is not an option. As the President has said, we must not and we will not wait on events while dangers gather. Finally, the new challenges have underscored the critical importance of allies, partners and coalitions. Global terror demands a global solution. Right now there are [CARDINAL] countries with forces operating in and around [GPE], [CARDINAL] of the largest military coalitions assembled since the Gulf War. And there are many who are not a part of the military coalition who are providing important intelligence, law enforcement and efforts to cut off terrorist financing. In this we have been tremendously helped by our allies around the world. And our [ORG] allies have particularly led the way, especially [GPE], which heads [ORG] for [GPE] and has sent air and naval and special forces into the region. [GPE] will never forget that within [TIME] of the attacks, [ORG], for the first time in its history, invoked Article V of its charter, stating that an attack on one is an attack on all. We will continue to work closely with our friends and our allies as the war progresses and as we seek victory over the scourge of terrorism. These enduring truths, made more vivid by [DATE], are very important to centering our foreign policy. But there is [CARDINAL] other important truth from this period: an earthquake of the magnitude of 9/11 can shift the tectonic plates of international politics. The international system has been in flux since the collapse of [NORP] power. Now it is possible -- indeed, probable -- that that transition is coming to an end. If that is right, if the collapse of [GPE] and 9/11 bookend a major shift in international politics, then this is a period not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity. Before the clay is dry again, [GPE] and our friends and our allies must move decisively to take advantage of these new opportunities. This is, then, a period akin to [DATE], when [NORP] leadership expanded the number of free and democratic states -- [GPE] and [GPE] among the great powers -- to create a new balance of power that favored freedom. It is, indeed, possible to see age-old problems in a new light. And, as an academic, may I suggest, to put aside [DATE] distinctions between realism and neoliberalism in thinking about the task ahead. Put more simply than any of its proponents would find acceptable, realists downplay the importance of values and the internal structures of states, emphasizing instead the balance of power as the key to stability and peace. Neoliberals emphasize the primacy of values, such as freedom and democracy and human rights and institutions in ensuring that a just political order is obtained. As a professor, I recognize that these debates enliven our conferences and our classrooms. I have participated in them, myself. In fact, most of us got tenure because we participated in them. But as a policymaker, I can tell you that they obscure reality. Power matters. Great powers matter. Great powers matter because they can influence international stability for good or for ill due their size, influence and their will. Great powers never have, and never will, just mind their own business within their borders. Thus, [GPE] collapse was important both because it resolved a high-stakes struggle that profoundly affected world peace and security, but also because values and ideas, democracy, markets and freedom triumphed. The socialist alternative that had existed for [DATE], which kept so much of the world isolated from the international economy and deprived [CARDINAL] of the benefits of freedom, died alongside the hammer and the sickle. Our goal [DATE], then, is not just a favorable balance of power, but what President [PERSON] has called a balance of power that favors freedom. After the end of the Cold War, and still in the shadow of September 11th, we may well be on the cusp of an era in which the world will not be bedeviled by great power rivalry. There will be differences among the great powers. But if the scales tip toward shared interest, rather than interest in conflict between them, this will truly be an era unlike any other. September 11th and its aftermath illuminated a fundamental divide between the forces of chaos and those of order. And all the world's great powers clearly see themselves as falling on the same side of this divide, and they are acting accordingly. [GPE] and [GPE] see that our common and fundamental interests and values far outweigh our differences. When people are trying to kill you, and when they attack because they hate freedom, other disputes -- from Franken-food to bananas to even important issues like the environment -- suddenly look a bit different. They look like policy differences, not fundamental clashes of values. [GPE] and [GPE] have begun to adopt new security roles that correspond with their identities as leading powers and democracies. [GPE]'s democratic transition is by no means yet complete. Yet, September 11th has helped to clarify elements of a common security agenda with [GPE]. We have also worked cooperatively on a range of issues with [GPE], an emerging democratic power, even as we work closely with [GPE]. And we are optimistic about the future of our relationship with [GPE], a country in the midst of a fundamental and still uncertain transition. But the emergence of a [GPE] that embraces the rule of law, markets and, ultimately, democracy would have a profound and positive effect on world security and prosperity. A balance of power that favors freedom is, at its core, a balance of power based on the ascendancy of shared values on every continent. That is why in places such as [GPE] and [GPE], values matter. They matter in our relations and they matter to the outcome of the balance of power that favors freedom -- values like religious freedom, media freedom and a recognition of the aspirations of long suffering minority groups. It is not enough for the great powers to share an interest in order; we need to move to sharing an interest in an order that is based on common values. [GPE] [DATE] possesses as much power and influence as any nation or entity in the world, and certainly in history. But in stark contrast to the leading powers of [DATE], our ambitions are not territorial. Our military and economic power are complemented by and multiplied by the values that underpin them: democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law, honest government, respect for women and children, private property, free speech, equal justice and religious tolerance. That is why [GPE] seeks a great world beyond the victory over terror. We seek not merely to leave the world safer, but to leave it better; to leave it a world that makes it possible for all men and women to experience the exhilaration and the challenges of freedom. This mission to leave the world safer and better is more important than ever in the face of September 11th. That is why President [PERSON] is strongly committed to free trade as a cornerstone of [NORP] policy -- trade that advances economic growth at home and abroad and advances the forces of freedom, as well. That is why in [GPE], [GPE] [DATE] the President put forth a new compact for global development defined by greater resources from wealthy nations and greater responsibility from developing nations. That fund will benefit poor countries, especially in Africa, but also in Latin America. The President pledged to seek a [PERCENT] increase in [GPE]'s core development assistance, with new funds devoted to projects and nations that govern justly, invest in their people and encourage economic freedom. There is also a new urgency to address our relations with [NORP] societies around the world in a positive way. This war in which we are engaged is not a clash of civilizations; it cannot be a clash of civilizations. Extremism and progress are most assuredly enemies of one another. But you do not have to reject tradition and belief to reap the benefits of integration into modern society. This was the central insight of [GPE] President [PERSON]'s speech on [DATE]. And as President [PERSON] recognized in his speech, the State of the Union, all fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence. [GPE] will stand with people on every continent, in [NORP] societies and in all societies that seek to claim a better future for their people. Education will play a particularly important role in societies that are making this quest. A good education teaches an appreciation of practical skills for the global economy. But is also provides a forum in which one learns to live with difference and to respect the rights of others. It fuels new hopes, instead of old hatreds. [NORP] have a deep understanding of the ability of education to open you up to the full range of possibilities. At [ORG], I was always heartened to stand before a class in which a fourth-generation [ORG] legatee sat next to the son or daughter of a migrant farm worker. It reinforced that education is the great equalizer. Because after that experience, it would not matter where they came from, it would matter where they were going. Here at [ORG], there are not only diverse students from a collection of [NORP] families, but also people from different backgrounds and from different countries -- [CARDINAL] nations. The common experience shared here by students, many of whom will go on to leadership roles here and in their own countries, will influence choices for a long, long time to come. And choices are important. Our continued success in the fight against terror, our success in making the world safer and better hinges on the choices made by the rest of the world. [GPE] cannot impose its vision on the world -- yet, we will use our influence to favor freedom. There are right and wrong choices and right and wrong acts. And governments are making them [DATE] for their own people and for the people of the world. We can never let the intricacies of cloistered debate -- with its many hues of gray and nuance -- obscure the need to speak and act with moral clarity. We must recognize that some states or leaders will choose wrongly. We must recognize that truly evil regimes will never be reformed. And we must recognize that such regimes must be confronted, not coddled. Nations must decide which side they are on in the fault line that divides civilization from terror. They must decide whether to embrace the paradigm of progress: democracy and freedom and human rights, and clean limited government. Together, with others, we can help people and nations make positive choices as they seek a better future, and we can deter those who want to take away a better future for others. September 11th reintroduced [GPE] to a part of itself that some had forgotten, or that some thought we no longer had. We have been reminded that defending freedom was not just the work of the greatest generation, it is the work of every generation. And we will carry this better part of ourselves out into the wider world. Thank you very much. MR. [PERSON]: Thank you so much for that superb lecture. I know the faculty really appreciated the use of theory in your lecture. The students were grimacing, but I think they also -- We are going to open the questions up to the [ORG] community, and I have [CARDINAL] questions that I will intersperse at some point that we have from [GPE], but let us open it to some students. We have [CARDINAL] shy student in the front here who will ask the first [CARDINAL]. Q The [PERSON] administration, in your speech you use a lot of moral dichotomies -- there is a fault line, there is the good, the evil. But it seems that the realities of foreign policy are much more complicated than that and [GPE] has to engage with some regimes that are either anti-democratic, like [GPE], or with dubious moral records, [GPE]. And I think the recent kind of silence regarding the coups in [GPE] shows that it is not always [PERCENT] for pro-democratic regimes as well. I was wondering if you feel that this moral rhetoric, but combined with actions that obviously have to serve our self-interest, create a perception of hypocrisy and threaten [GPE]'s credibility with our allies and internationally. DR. [PERSON]: Thank you. No, I do not . That will not surprise you. No, it is a very good question. Look, the truth of the matter is, though, unless you know where you are going, unless you are clear about where you are going, you will go nowhere. And what moral clarity gives you is a compass against which to measure everything else -- because you are right, it is a complex world, it is a hard world. The complexities bring you into different kinds of situations in which different tactics are important. But if you ever lose sight of what you think is wrong and what is right, then you have nothing to guide you. And if you ever lose sight of the fact that there is wrong and right, you have nothing to guide you. I would cite, for instance, the [NORP] struggle for which [PERSON] is known against [GPE]. It is absolutely clear that we engaged [GPE]. We entered into large-scale arms control talks and treaties with [GPE] to keep from blowing each other up. But we knew the character of [GPE] and so we also made certain that we always made room to try and engage around the government of [GPE] to people in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] of the most interesting aspects of the end of the Cold War, the periods of [DATE], was the degree to which a lot of people who had been a part of exchanges with [GPE], scholarly exchanges and others, emerged from that to be the voice of a new liberalism in [GPE] when conditions permitted. Now, we have to do the same thing now. The fact is that when you are engaging with a state that, shall we say, has not yet met the test democratically, you have to say so. I was recently in a meeting with the President, with a central [NORP] leader, with [PERSON], in which he said to him, yes, I appreciate what you have done in the war on terrorism, this is terrific and we are glad that we were able to deal with the [ORG]; our relationship will get stronger as you reform economically and politically. And you can never leave those words out of any such conversation. Let me just speak briefly to [GPE] because, in fact, [GPE] did speak out against anti-constitutional means both publicly and privately. We did make very clear that we believe that democratically elected governments could not be overthrown by extraconstitutional means. But the threat to democracy in [GPE] did not begin with those people in the streets. We have to remember that [PERSON] also, in shutting down the press, for instance, was doing things to harm [NORP] democracy long before that fateful outcome. Now, we are all very hopeful that what he has said -- which is that he plans to be self-reflective and the nation needs to be self-reflective -- will lead him to recognize the importance of democratic values for real, not just claiming that because you are elected you are exercising democratic values. We cannot fall into that trap. When people are elected, they especially have a responsibility to follow democratic values and we have to call it for what we see. But we were very strong in this and, in fact, joined with countries in the region to talk about the importance of respecting democratic processes. Q President [PERSON] has said [GPE] is part of the axis of evil. However, in [DATE], countries like [GPE] and [GPE] have pursued a fruitful open-door policy in regard to [GPE]. Do you think that a more flexible and realist policy by the [GPE] towards [GPE] could be in the political and economic interests of the [GPE], itself. DR. [PERSON]: Well, I think that the problem with [GPE] is that its policies unfortunately belie the notion that engagement with it has helped. It has been engaged -- I mean, [GPE] has relations with [GPE]. A number of our [NORP] allies have relations with [GPE]. Our problem with [GPE] is in policies that are so destructive to international politics -- from the support of terrorism around the world to the support of terrorism in the Middle East and, frankly, the un-elected few in [GPE] who continue to frustrate the hopes of their own people, who repeatedly turn out and vote to throw off tyranny. There are an un-elected few who continue to frustrate the hopes of the people. And we are simply speaking the truth about the nature of [GPE]. Now, the truth is we have had some useful interaction with [GPE] around [GPE]. [GPE] is [GPE]'s neighbor. We expect [GPE] to have good relations with [GPE], but they need to be transparent relations, they should be relations that are state to state, not relations that try to play into the complex and difficult politics of [GPE]. So I think that our view is that the behavior of [GPE] at this point would suggest that it is a state that while there may be some positive forces within it, those positive forces are not quite yet capable of changing the nature of [GPE]'s behavior; [GPE]'s behavior continues to be a major problem in international politics. And we watch the developments with great interest, but [NORP] behavior puts it squarely in the axis of evil -- whether it is weapons of mass destruction or terrorism or any of those things. It is a complicated situation, but I think the behavior speaks for itself. Q I have a question about democracy being a compass. I understand that the idea, the [NORP] foreign policy idea is to sort of influence the development of democracies. However, some nations, it seems to me, may not be either ready or on the verge of becoming democratic. And so if this is sort of pushed on them or imposed it could create instability and chaos. And is there -- my first question is, is there not a need to respect a pace at which democracy can actually be established in certain countries? And, second of all, if we look at reform, for example, in the former [GPE], as well as [GPE], and then we see that the fast pace at which reforms occurred in [GPE] led to chaos and a bit of anarchy -- and, of course, we see that in [GPE], the progress is a lot slower -- do you think there is a need for shock therapy? Is it better, is it better for preserving stability? DR. [PERSON]: Thank you. It is a very good question. I would hate as a policymaker to have to make the choice of who is ready for democracy and who is not . And I think that it is really not our responsibility to try and divide countries into, if you will, tiers with whom you push democracy because they are kind of ready and those that might not quite be ready because of chaos and instability. First of all, whenever we have tried to do that, whenever we have tried to make judgments about who is ready and who is not, we have almost always been wrong. Because societies that -- particularly societies that are tyrannical are brittle very often inside, and are opaque to us. And so I think our better response is to be clear about the importance of democratic development, to press the agenda on behalf of people whom from within these societies are trying to bring about democratic change, to offer a hand to those countries that are in transition and to provide tools that might help the democratic transition. You mentioned [GPE]. While none of us believe that just because [GPE] joined [ORG] its democratic development is assured -- nobody believes that -- but we do recognize that some of the things that [GPE] will do as a part of its [ORG] membership -- whether it is rule of law or transparency or giving greater economic freedom to entrepreneurs -- will change the political landscape in [GPE]. So there are lots of different ways to go about this. I do think we need to recognize, too, that just holding an election is not democracy. It is a first step, but democratic consolidation takes some time. And even mature democracies like our own take a long time to get all of the pieces right. I am often fond of saying, you know, when the Founding Fathers said we, the people they did not mean me. And it is taken us a little while to get that piece of it right. So we should recognize that democracy is something that you build brick by brick, step by step. But unless you recognize that it is a universal aspiration of all people to be free, unless you recognize that given a choice between tyranny and freedom people will choose freedom, you will always be surprised by how much that is true. We just saw it again in [GPE]. People said, well, is [GPE] after [DATE] of civil war and [ORG], maybe they are not quite ready. Yes, well, the democratic transition there is going to be hard. But if you have any doubt that these people wanted to be freed from the tyranny of the [ORG] and that they want a chance at democratic development, you should just talk to the many people now who are trying to help them get there. So I do not think we should make those choices. I think we have to be firm in our belief in the values, I think we have to press the values. And I think we have to provide opportunities for leaders to make the right choices. Right now we are fortunate in that many of the incentives are very powerful -- to give your people greater creativity and greater freedom. Because the truth of the matter is, economic development in the modern world is dependent on human potential. And human potential does not flourish in tyrannies. And so the incentives to freedom and to greater freedom are very strong. I think we have to press them. As to [GPE] and [GPE], I think I would read what happened in [GPE] a little bit differently. Yes, it was chaotic and it was scary sometimes. But I would never be one to say that the fact that political change preceded economic change was a bad thing for [GPE]. Indeed, it may well be that when economic change now begins to catch up that some of the political circumstances are stronger and more in place. They have still got a very long way to go, and this consolidation of democracy in [GPE] will take a very long time. But I have no doubt that the political changes that created a kind of pluralism were for the good, not for the bad. Q I wanted to know, in your remarks [DATE] you said that regimes that coddled terrorists will, in your words, be confronted and not coddled. The [NORP] regime for [DATE] has invited terrorists into their headquarters -- and these are known individuals who have participated in assassinations -- and has given them safe haven. How far does a regime have to go before it will meet that criteria and be confronted and not coddled? Thank you very much. DR. [PERSON]: Well, we have been very clear with Chairman [PERSON] and with [ORG] that we expect, and the world expects them to live up to their responsibilities to rid themselves of any terrorist influences that may be close to or associated with [ORG]. We have even given them ways to do it. [CARDINAL] of the things that we are doing in our policy is to offer assistance to any leader who wishes to get rid of terrorism. We are doing it with [PERSON] in [GPE], we are doing it with [PERSON] in [GPE], and with [ORG]. That is essentially what the [ORG] work plan is -- it is a way to deal with the security environment and to arrest and to bring to justice terrorists. I do not think that there is any doubt in anyone's mind that we have not been fully happy with the response -- we have been disappointed in the response. But the context in the Middle East in which the war on terrorism cannot be fought solely by military means and in which you need the cooperation of the states in the region and you need the cooperation, indeed, of [ORG] to fight terrorists, we are willing to keep trying and we are trying. Now, the arrangement that was made over [DATE] in which these prisoners are being transferred and are going to be taken care of in a custodial fashion by [NORP] and [NORP] wardens is [CARDINAL] way to help move this process forward. But let me be very clear. The President, when he made his speech on [DATE], was more clear, or was clearer than any [NORP] President has been in a very, very long time of what was expected of all the parties. Peace in the Middle East is not easy. If it had been easy, we would have had it by now. And the reason that it is not easy is that everybody in the region has to do some difficult things in order to achieve it: [GPE] has to do difficult things to come into conformity with [CARDINAL] and 338, and to create the conditions for a [NORP] state; the [NORP] neighbors of [GPE] have a lot of work to do to bring about the condition for normalization of relations with [GPE] and to make certain that terror is not incited from their own territories. It is simply not acceptable to have some of the incitement of terror that you have had in the [NORP] world, and we have made that very clear. And, finally, [ORG] has a lot of work to do to actually meet lead its people in a way that does not incite and does not give way to people's concerns and people's hostilities but, rather, gives them another path toward economic development and prosperity. It is a hard road for everybody, but we believe that we have laid out a road map and we are going to pursue it step by step. Q To follow up on the question on morality. [GPE]'s current regime clearly belongs to [GPE]'s worst enemies. Its defense potential, however, might be strengthened by some foreign leaders who also claim to be friends with [GPE]. [CARDINAL] of them, [NORP] President [PERSON], had been allegedly taped while agreeing to sell to [GPE] [CARDINAL] advanced air defense systems capable of tracking stealth bombers. The tape with allegedly [PERSON]'s voice was authenticated by [NORP] forensic experts. And [GPE] military intelligence also confirmed that [GPE], indeed, possesses such radar systems. What measures is the [GPE] government currently taking to investigate this allegation? What consequences might [PERSON] face if the allegations are confirmed? And, more broadly, how should [GPE] deal with those regimes who support its war against terror on words, but help its enemies in deeds? Thank you. DR. [PERSON]: [PERSON] also was my research assistant at [ORG], so there is a little bit of a [ORG] connection here. Hi, nice to see you. Let me start, [PERSON], with the last part of the question, which is how to respond to regimes that are publicly or rhetorically supportive of the war on terrorism and perhaps doing things that are not so helpful. And there are a couple of things. First of all, we have been pretty clear with everybody that when we discover that there is that inconsistency, that we expect the inconsistency to be addressed, and that it would have very severe consequences for [GPE]-in-the-blank relations if, in fact, that inconsistency is not addressed. In some cases, it has been a matter of saying to countries, all right, you may not have the capacity to address terrorism in your own midst; maybe that is what you are saying when you do nothing while saying you support the war on terrorism. We will help you in those circumstances, and to offer intelligence and the like. I have to say that for the most part, the number of countries in that category is pretty small. We have been pretty impressed with the degree to which countries are not just rhetorically supportive of, but actually supportive of the war on terrorism. And I think there is a reason for that, which is that terrorism and its ugly face is actually a threat to a lot of regimes, not just to us. And so we have tended to get extremely good cooperation. As to [GPE], I do not want to comment on the specific example because there is a lot that is gone on there and I do not want to comment on what is really still an allegation. But I will say that we have talked very seriously to the [NORP] regime about some of the issues of proliferation that we are concerned about with the [NORP] regime. We consider [GPE] relations to be potentially extremely important to stability, particularly in southern Europe. [GPE] is a huge country, [CARDINAL] people. It is a country that borders on extremely important countries like [GPE], and it is a country that has a past of being able to cooperate with the West in other periods of time -- a people that have been able to cooperate with the West in other periods of time. So we are seeking good relations. But we are -- we have let the [NORP] government know that the proliferation issues are extremely important not just in the war on terrorism, but, for instance, in the Balkans, as well. We have been very clear about that, and [GPE] relations will progress more strongly when there is some action on some of those items. Q I am the Director of [ORG] at [ORG]. [GPE] is in a profound crisis. It raises a number of very important security and economic issues for [GPE]. Some would argue that if this were [GPE] or [GPE] or [GPE], aid would have been forthcoming by now. Is there some point at which we in [GPE] -- the iffies and the administration -- should really call time out, the social crisis is increasing; the political polarization is very deep, and provide economic support? DR. [PERSON]: Well, President [PERSON] made very clear to President [PERSON] not too long after he came to power that [GPE] is extremely important to [GPE] and to the regional powers, and that we are going to be there for, and be supportive of [GPE]. The fact is, though, [GPE] has to do some difficult things. And [GPE] is in very intense discussions with the [ORG] about how to move forward. It has now taken a hiatus to go home and to try to see if it can arrange politically to be able to do some of the things that it needs to be able to do. It is not an unwillingness to have international assistance go to [GPE]. It is an understanding that the conditions have to be right so that those resources actually make a difference. And some of the things that [GPE] needs to do will improve confidence in [GPE] just by doing them. There was a huge disbursement of resources to [GPE], I believe [MONEY] in [DATE]. It did not stem the crisis because the conditions were not right. And so it has to be a combination of willingness to provide resources, but also understanding that circumstances are not always right in which resources will make a difference. Now, we are in constant contact with the [NORP]. We fully believe that if they can just do the things that the [ORG] is requesting that they do, we believe that they can find a way back to sustainable growth. The President talks frequently to other leaders in the region, as well, because we recognize that this is not just [GPE], this is about the whole hemisphere. But [GPE] has, and should know that it has no better friend than [GPE], and that it has a friend that will be willing to help and to advocate on its behalf for resources at the time at which they would make a difference toward sustainable growth. And that is where we are. Q I'd like to go back to the Middle East again and ask you to comment on the [PERSON] plan. What is it that keeps us from giving it a full endorsement as the beginning of a process to end [NORP] terrorism and [NORP] terrorism? DR. [PERSON]: Thank you. The President had an opportunity [DATE], of course, to be with Crown Prince [PERSON] over an extended period of time. They not only spent time in the kind of normal expanded -- well, it was not very expanded, it was a small group to begin with -- but they spent a good deal of time alone, talking about the future. And the President told the Crown Prince very strongly how important he thought his leadership was in stepping up with a plan. Every element of it may not be workable. Some of it would have to be negotiated in terms of borders and the like. But we need to keep our eye on the big picture here, and the promise of deeper [NORP] engagement in the peace process would be a tremendous breakthrough for the entire process. The truth of the matter is that while we all focus very heavily on the [NORP]-Palestinian piece of this, this, of course, takes place in a regional context. It takes place in the context in which [GPE] has to have security with its neighbors; it has to have normal relations with its neighbors, like it has with [GPE] and [GPE]. It needs to move to normal relations with the other [NORP] states. And the [NORP] states, who also have a stake in the way that the [GPE]-Palestinian issues are resolved, have to have a stake in the final outcome of those negotiations. So we believe that what the [NORP] initiative most represents is a new impetus to have [NORP] engaged as [GPE] and [GPE] have been in bringing peace to the region as a whole. And so we have been extremely positive about it; we have embraced the concept in large parts of it. We understand that there are some things that really are matters of negotiation. But we think it is a tremendously powerful tool and extremely important step in this long-running conflict. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksorganizingforactiondinner1", "text": "AboutSearch Well, it is good to see all of you. And I have had a chance to hug you and catch up. So now it is all business. [Laughter] Let me start by thanking [PERSON] and [PERSON] and all the [ORG] staff for the great work that they do each and every day. I have gotten a lot of compliments from a lot of you about the quality of the [ORG] staff, and I actually concur that they are terrific and passionate about the work that we are doing out there. I just had a chance to talk to some of the leaders from [GPE] and communities all across the country who are pounding the pavement and talking to their neighbors and talking to their friends. And the levels of enthusiasm and energy that they projected was inspiring, and it really reminds me of why what I do in [ORG] matters, because I got folks like that-out on the ground, out in communities [DATE]-that are counting on me to give voice to the incredible work that they are doing, but also the values that they represent. And I want to thank all of you. As I look around the room, I would not be President if it were not for this room. And there are a lot of people here who are new friends, but there are also some folks here who supported me way back in the day when I had no gray hair and I did not wear a tie. Somebody just showed me a picture [DATE], and I looked really young. [Laughter] Most of this is just going to be a conversation. I want to spend time on questions and answers and dialogue and discussion. But let me just make a couple of quick comments. Number [CARDINAL], as I said at the State of the Union Address, I genuinely think [DATE] can be [DATE] for [GPE]. We have now really consolidated the recovery. If you look at the statistics-8.5 million new jobs, unemployment rate the lowest it is been since before I was elected; you have got manufacturing coming back; we have made progress on energy, fuel efficiency, carbon emissions reductions; making steady progress in terms of reforming our education system-we are actually poised to make [DATE] the [NORP] century, just like [DATE] was. And [PERSON] is over here nodding his head. [PERSON] was representing [GPE] and did an outstanding job in [GPE]. And one of the remarkable things that I think he will affirm is that everybody outside of [GPE] actually thinks that we are doing a remarkable job, that our economic growth is the envy of most of the developed world. And yet that is not always reflected in people's moods here in the [GPE]. And there is a reason for that. Our growth has been uneven. Those of us at the very top have disproportionately benefited from productivity gains, technology, globalization. Middle class families, working class families, still feel like they are struggling [DATE] to get by. And the ladders of opportunity for folks who want to work their way into the middle class are not as robust as they used to be. And so, even in the midst of recovery, there is still a lot of anxiety out there. And what I said in the State of the Union was that we have to be focused like a laser on building back up an opportunity society in which everybody feels like if they work hard and if they are responsible, they can get ahead. And that means more jobs; that means making sure people are trained for the jobs that are out there. It means making sure kids get a world-class education. It means that work pays and that not only are they getting a decent paycheck that can support their families, but that they have got retirement security and health care security and all the things that give them a stable platform to live their lives and make sure their kids succeed. So we are doing that. And I have also said that [ORG] may not be willing to break gridlock during [DATE]. I am going to look for every opportunity to work with them. But if they are not, we are just going to go ahead and do some work. So just [CARDINAL] example: [DATE] at [ORG], we announced [CARDINAL] more advanced manufacturing hubs, [CARDINAL] in [GPE] and [CARDINAL] in [GPE], where we are going to take cutting-edge research that is being done on advanced metallurgy and digital technology. And consortiums of universities and businesses are coming together to bring jobs back to [GPE], attract investment. And we did not have to do that with some legislation, although there is some legislation pending in [ORG] that could expand it. We did the same thing to make sure Federal contractors are paying their employees $[MONEY] an hour. We are doing the same thing when it comes to making sure that we have got high-speed broadband in every classroom in [GPE]. I already have a commitment that is going to mean [CARDINAL] of students, [CARDINAL] students, [CARDINAL] schools across [GPE], are going to be wired for broadband. We are doing that in conjunction with the [ORG] and the private sector. And so we are just going to keep on looking for ways in which we can realize the values that we have been fighting for, for a long time. But as all of you know because you were involved in [DATE] or [DATE], it does not work if we do not have folks on the ground who are speaking out on behalf of these issues and these values. Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what is necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that is where [ORG] comes in, because it is able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work. And that grassroots work that is done also then energizes me and informs the issues that we are going to try to lift up over the course of [DATE]. So I just want to say to all of you, what you are doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. And you do not always-it is not always flashy. It is often at the ground level, but it makes a difference. And [CARDINAL] final example of that difference that is being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Obviously, nowhere has there been more misinformation, nowhere are just basic facts more contested. But as a consequence of some of the folks that have been doing this work on the ground, as of [DATE], we have signed up [CARDINAL] people through the exchanges. That is [CARDINAL] people who have the security of health care, in many cases for the very first time. And that does not count [CARDINAL] who are already able to get health insurance because they are staying on their parent's plan. That does not count [CARDINAL] who have been able to sign up through [ORG]. And we are not done yet. So when you have got grassroots folks who are committed and energized like they are, it makes a difference. And whatever issues you care about, whether it is climate change or women's reproductive health or foreign policy or education or access to higher education, having folks who are willing to fight for what they believe in connected to what we do here is really powerful and important. And they could not do it without you. So I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspresentingthecongressionalmedalhonormajorgeneraljamesldayusmcretired", "text": "AboutSearch SPEAKER. [PERSON] and I are delighted to welcome all of you here [DATE], including our Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, [PERSON]; the National Security Adviser, [PERSON]; Senator [PERSON] and Congressman [PERSON]; Deputy Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON]; Secretary [PERSON]; General [PERSON] and other members of [ORG]; General [PERSON]; Deputy Secretary [PERSON]; Mr. [PERSON], the president of [ORG], and General [PERSON] and other recipients of the Medal of Honor who are here. To all the commanders of our veterans service organizations and proud members of [ORG] and former marines, to the friends and the large and wonderful family of General [PERSON] and Mrs. [PERSON], we welcome you. I thank Captain [PERSON] for the fine invocation. He is not devoid of a sense of humor; before we came out here, he said he was going out to offer the exorcism. To those who lived through World War II and those who grew up in the years that followed, few memories inspire more awe and horror than the battle for [GPE]. In the greatest conflict the world has ever known, our forces fought no engagement more bitter or more bloody. In [DATE] of fighting, [GPE] suffered [CARDINAL], 000 dead in this final epic battle, the most costly one during the entire Pacific war. At the very heart of this crucible was the fight for a hill called Sugar Loaf, the key to breaking the enemy's line across the south of the island, some of the grimmest combat our forces had ever seen. The marines on Sugar Loaf faced a hail of artillery, mortars, and grenades. They were raked by constant machinegun fire. Time and again, our men would claw their way uphill only to be repulsed by the enemy. Progress was measured by the yard. On [DATE], a [DATE] corporal named [PERSON] led several other marines to a shell crater on the slope of Sugar Loaf. What happened then surpasses our powers of imagination. On [DATE] in that isolated hole, Corporal [PERSON] and those with him fought off an advance by [CARDINAL] of enemy soldiers. [TIME] he helped to repel [CARDINAL] more assaults, as those with him fell dead or injured. Braving heavy fire, he escorted [CARDINAL] wounded comrades, [CARDINAL] by [CARDINAL], to safety. But he would not stay in safety. Instead, he returned to his position to continue the fight. As [CARDINAL] of his fellow marines later reported, the corporal was everywhere. He would run from [CARDINAL] spot to another trying to get more fire on the enemy. When [DATE] broke, Corporal [PERSON] kept on fighting, alone but for [CARDINAL] wounded fellow marine. Through assault after assault and into his second night, he fought on. Burned by white phosphorus and wounded by shrapnel, he continued to fire his weapon and hold his ground. He hauled ammunition from a disabled vehicle back to his shellhole and fought and fought, [CARDINAL] assault after another, [DATE], then the next. The battle on Sugar Loaf decimated [CARDINAL] [NORP] regiments. But when Corporal [PERSON] was finally relieved after [DATE] of continuous fighting, virtually alone, he had stood his ground. And the enemy dead around his foxhole numbered [CARDINAL]. His heroism played a crucial part in [GPE]'s victory at [GPE]. And that success opened the way to the capture of [GPE] and the ultimate triumph of the forces of freedom in the Pacific. Now, for this extraordinary valor, we recognize [PERSON] as [CARDINAL] of the bravest of the brave. In words that echo from the peaks of [NORP] military history, he has distinguished himself, at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty. As Commander in Chief, I am proud to award General [PERSON] our Nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor. This medal confirms what every marine in this room already knows: the name [PERSON] belongs in the rolls of the [ORG]' greatest heroes, alongside [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. General, your achievements leave us all in awe. In particular, it is hard to know whether we should be conferring on you a Medal of Honor for bravery or for modesty. Let me tell you the story of how we happen to be here [DATE], [DATE]. Although the battle for [GPE] was still raging when his battlefield commanders nominated young Corporal [PERSON]* for this decoration, so many died in the fighting and so many reports were lost in the battle, the paperwork simply never went forward in [DATE]. General [PERSON] later said that awards were not on their minds in [DATE]. As he put it, We just had a job to do, and we wanted to get the job done. [DATE], when veterans of [GPE] wanted to restart the process, [PERSON] forbade them from doing so. Then a general, he felt that seeking such an honor would set a bad example for those he commanded. General [PERSON], everyone in our [ORG], in the military and outside it, can learn a lot from your selfless conduct both under fire and throughout your life. In your modest service, as well as your heroism, you are a shining example to all [NORP]. [DATE], as we applaud [CARDINAL] extraordinary performance on Sugar Loaf, we also celebrate [CARDINAL] of the most remarkable military careers in our Nation's history. [DATE] after the action we recall now, [PERSON] distinguished himself again on [GPE] and received the Bronze Star for his heroism. During a career that spanned [DATE], he rose from enlisted man through the ranks to major general, becoming one of the greatest mustangs [ORG] ever produced. In [GPE], his valor in combat was recognized with [CARDINAL] Silver Stars. In [GPE], his leadership and bravery under fire earned him a third Silver Star. Just as astonishing, for his service in [CARDINAL] wars, [PERSON] received [CARDINAL] Purple Hearts. General, I am told that your ability to absorb enemy fire led to a lively debate among those who served with you as to whether it was safer to stand near you or far away. Amid all this heroism, General [PERSON] and his wife have also raised a fine family. He has given not only a lifetime of devotion to the [ORG], he and [PERSON] have brought up [CARDINAL] more generations of marines: his son, Lieutenant Colonel [PERSON], and grandson, Lance Corporal [PERSON], both of whom are here [DATE], and we welcome you. General, we thank you for a [DATE] lived to the highest standards of patriotism, dedication, and bravery. For all marines and, indeed, for all your fellow [NORP], you are the embodiment of the motto Semper Fidelis. You have been unerringly faithful to those who fought alongside you, to the [ORG], and to [GPE]. We are profoundly fortunate to count you among our heroes. On behalf of all [NORP], I thank you for [DATE] of service without parallel and for all you have done to preserve the freedom that is our most sacred gift. Thank you, sir.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspriorcabinetmeetingandexchangewithreporters2", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. All right, well, I am glad to be able to pull together my [ORG] for the first official [ORG] meeting of [DATE], and I want to wish everybody [DATE]. We have got a lot to do in [DATE]. As I have said before, this is going to be [DATE] of action. We have seen the economy improve. We want to maximize the pace of our recovery, but most importantly, we want to make sure that every [NORP] is able to benefit from that recovery; that we are not leaving anybody behind and everybody is getting a fair shot. I was very pleased to see the [ORG] and the [ORG] agree to a budget and to put forward a bill that will fund our Government at levels that allow us to take some important steps to provide the services and the help that [NORP] need and [NORP] families need in order to get ahead in this economy. And so I would urge that [ORG] pass that funding measure as quickly as possible so that all these agencies have some certainty around their budgets. And [ORG] is going to have some additional work over the course of [DATE]; specifically, it is important that they do something about unemployment insurance. Although we have seen improvements in the economy and job creation in our economy, I think we all know that there are a lot of hard-working [NORP] out there who are desperately looking for a job, and unemployment insurance is not only good for them and necessary for them, but it is also good for our economy as a whole and will actually accelerate our growth if we go ahead and get that done. We know that we need to get immigration reform done, a major piece of unfinished business from [DATE]. So [ORG] is going to be busy, and I am looking forward to working with [NORP] and [NORP], [ORG] Members and [ORG] Members, to try to continue to advance the economic recovery and to provide additional ladders of opportunity for everybody. But one of the things that I will be emphasizing in this meeting is the fact that we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we are providing [NORP] the kind of help that they need. I have got a pen, and I have got a phone. And I can use that pen to sign Executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward in helping to make sure our kids are getting the best education possible and making sure that our businesses are getting the kind of support and help they need to grow and advance, to make sure that people are getting the skills that they need to get those jobs that our businesses are creating. And I have got a phone that allows me to convene [NORP] from every walk of life- nonprofits, businesses, the private sector, universities-to try to bring more and more [NORP] together around what I think is a unifying theme: making sure that this is a country where if you work hard, you can make it. And so one of the things that I am going to be talking to my [ORG] about is, how do we use all the tools available to us, not just legislation, in order to advance a mission that I think unifies all [NORP]: the belief that everybody has got to take responsibility, everybody has got to work hard, but if you do, that you can support a family and meet the kinds of obligations that you have to yourself and your family, but also to your communities and to your [ORG]. We are already seeing some examples of that. In fact, [DATE], I will be traveling [DATE] down to [GPE] to talk about a manufacturing innovation hub that we initiated, talked about in our State of the Union [DATE]. It is going to be moving forward. And there are a lot of folks down in [GPE] who are excited, because it is a perfect example of the kind of public-private partnership that can really make a difference in growing our economy faster and creating the kinds of good-paying jobs that help people get ahead. I will also be pulling together university presidents from all across the country to talk about how we can make college education more accessible to more young people around this country. And we are going to be bringing in CEOs from across the country to also have a conversation about commitments they can make to start hiring the long-term unemployed, people who oftentimes have terrific skills, have a great work ethic, have wonderful experience, but because of the misfortune of having been laid off or lost their jobs in the depths of a extremely severe recession, have been out of work long enough that now we are finding, it is very hard for them to just get in the door and make their case to an employer; that there is some screening that is taking place for people who have been out of work for [DATE] or [CARDINAL] and it makes it harder for them to get the kind of shot that they need. And we are going to try to work with CEOs to make a pledge that we are going to take a second look at these [NORP] who are very eager to get back to work and have the capacity to do so, but are not getting the kind of shot that they need. So overall, the message to my [ORG]-and that will be amplified in our State of the Union-is that we need all hands on deck to build on the recovery that we are already seeing. The economy is improving, but it could be improving even faster. A lot of people are doing better than they were in the depths of the recession, but there are still a lot of folks who need help. And I am absolutely confident that in [DATE], if we are all working in the same direction and not worrying so much about political points, but worrying much more about getting the job done, that we can see a lot of improvement [DATE], and people will look back on [DATE] as [DATE] in which we did not just turn the corner in the aggregate for the economy, but everybody started feeling a little more optimistic about our futures. So I am looking forward to the discussion. And with that, I am going to kick you all out. Review of [GPE] Signals Intelligence and Electronic Surveillance Programs Q. How do you think the [ORG] is going to affect [DATE]? And how will you address it on [DATE]? [SPEAKER]. Thank you, guys. Q. Have you finished your review on the [ORG]? [SPEAKER]. Actually, it is getting close. So I will have quite a bit to say about that very soon. Q. How will that affect [DATE]? [SPEAKER]. Thank you, guys.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksproposedlegislationsubmittedthecongressauthorizetheusemilitaryforce", "text": "AboutSearch Good [TIME]. [DATE], as part of an international coalition of [CARDINAL] nations, including [NORP] countries, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against [ORG] in [GPE] and in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] 000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists. We are disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move. We are destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We are taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders. In [GPE], local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed [ORG] back. In [GPE], [ORG] failed in its major push to take the town of [GPE], losing countless fighters in the process, fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians. And we have seen reports of sinking morale among [ORG] fighters as they realize the futility of their cause. Now, make no mistake, this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It is going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive, [ORG] is on the defensive, and [ORG] is going to lose. Its barbaric murders of so many people, including [NORP] hostages, are a desperate and revolting attempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or its ideology, because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction. And with vile groups like this, there is [CARDINAL] option: With our allies and partners, we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. And when I announced our strategy against [ORG] in [DATE], I said that we are strongest as a nation when the President and [ORG] work together. [DATE] my administration submitted a draft resolution to [ORG] to authorize the use of force against [ORG]. I want to be very clear about what it does and what it does not do. This resolution reflects our core objective to destroy [ORG]. It supports the comprehensive strategy that we have been pursuing with our allies and our partners: a systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes against [ORG] in [GPE] and [GPE]; support and training for local forces on the ground, including the moderate [NORP] opposition; preventing [ORG] attacks in the region and beyond, including by foreign terrorist fighters who try to threaten our countries; regional and international support for an inclusive [ORG] that unites the [NORP] people and strengthens [NORP] forces against [ORG]; humanitarian assistance for the innocent civilians of [GPE] and [GPE], who are suffering so terribly under [ORG]'s reign of horror. I want to thank Vice President [PERSON], Secretaries [PERSON] and [PERSON], and General [PERSON] for their leadership in advancing our strategy. Even as we meet this challenge in [GPE] and [GPE], we all agree that [CARDINAL] of our weapons against terrorists like [ORG]-a critical part of our strategy-is the values we live here at home. [CARDINAL] of the best antidotes to the hateful ideologies that try to recruit and radicalize people to violent extremism is our own example as diverse and tolerant societies that welcome the contributions of all people, including people of all faiths. The resolution we have submitted [DATE] does not call for the deployment of [GPE] ground combat forces to [GPE] or [GPE]. It is not the authorization of another ground war, like [GPE] or [GPE]. The [CARDINAL] 600 [NORP] troops in [GPE] [DATE] largely serve on bases, and yes, they face the risks that come with service in any dangerous environment. But they do not have a combat mission. They are focused on training [NORP] forces, including [NORP] forces. As I have said before, I am convinced that [GPE] should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East. That is not in our national security interest, and it is not necessary for us to defeat [ORG]. Local forces on the ground who know their countries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to [ORG], and that is what they are doing. At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unforeseen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of [ORG] leaders, and our partners did not have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our Special Forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven. So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate. And there is no heavier decision than asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives on our behalf. As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary for our national security. Finally, this resolution repeals the [DATE] authorization of force for the invasion of [GPE] and limits this new authorization to [DATE]. I do not believe [GPE]'s interests are served by endless war or by remaining on a perpetual war footing. As a nation, we need to ask the difficult and necessary questions about when, why, and how we use military force. After all, it is our troops who bear the costs of our decisions, and we owe them a clear strategy and the support they need to get the job done. So this resolution will give [ORG] and our coalition the continuity we need for [DATE]. It is not a timetable. It is not announcing that the mission is completed at any given period. What it is saying is that [ORG] should revisit the issue at [DATE] term. It is conceivable that the mission is completed earlier. It is conceivable that after deliberation, debate, and evaluation, that there are additional tasks to be carried out in this area. And the people's representatives, with a new President, should be able to have that discussion. In closing, I want to say that in crafting this resolution we have consulted with, and listened to, both [NORP] and [NORP] in [ORG]. We have made a sincere effort to address difficult issues that we have discussed together. In [DATE] ahead, we will continue to work closely with leaders and Members of [ORG] on both sides of the aisle. I believe this resolution can grow even stronger with the thoughtful and dignified debate that this moment demands. I am optimistic that it can win strong bipartisan support and that we can show our troops and the world that [NORP] are united in this mission. Now, [DATE], our men and women in uniform continue the fight against [ORG], and we salute them for their courageous service. We pray for their safety. We stand with their families who miss them and who are sacrificing here at home. But know this: Our coalition is strong, our cause is just, and our mission will succeed. And long after the terrorists we face [DATE] are destroyed and forgotten, [GPE] will continue to stand free and tall and strong. May God bless our troops, and may God bless [GPE]. Thank you very much, everybody. NOTE: The President spoke at [TIME] in [FAC] at [FAC].

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksreceptionforsenatoredwardmkennedymcleanvirginia", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you so much. Senator and Mrs. [PERSON], the [PERSON] family, Senator [PERSON] and Members of the [ORG], Congressmen, Congressman-to-be [PERSON], and [PERSON], and all those who made [TIME] possible, I thank you so much for your help for our friend. [PERSON], thank you for making us laugh. I will tell you a story about [PERSON]. I never told this story in public before. Do not get that excited, it is not that good. I had never met [PERSON] in my entire life, except on a movie screen. And in [DATE] or [DATE], I went up to Long Island in the summertime. [PERSON] and I were up there visiting our friend [PERSON], who is here [TIME]. And every summertime there is a softball game to raise money between the artists and the writers. And they asked me if I would be an umpire in this game. And once I realized there were some members of the press there and I'd be able to give them grades instead of the other way around, I eagerly accepted. Now, at that time a lot of you will not remember this; I hope, at least, you will not remember it, and I hope you will forget after I tell you [TIME]. I had given a speech for Governor [PERSON] at the Democratic Convention, which I intend to complete here [TIME]. Anyway I cannot believe I said that. The announcer for the ball game was [PERSON], the guy that does that Brady's Bits in Parade magazine every Sunday, you know? He is a delightful man, but when he saw me out there on the mound about ready to call balls and strikes, he saidhe introduced mehe said, This is Governor [PERSON] from [GPE]. He is up here visiting, and if he takes as long to make the calls [DATE] as he did to speak in [GPE], we will never get out of here. I really appreciated that. Anyway, so the game starts, and the next time the sides change, I look up in the stands, and this tall guy stands up and walks down, comes out to the pitcher's mound, shakes my hand, and says, I am [PERSON]. And he said, I may be the only person in [GPE] besides your mother who feels this way, but I liked that speech. Tell him to go to hell. That is verbatim what he said. [Applause] You just applauded for the next ambassador to [GPE]. Ladies and gentlemen, you know we all do a lot of these events, and a lot of you are the backbone of our party. And sometimes we do them with great energy; sometimes we do them with interest; sometimes we do them because we know it is the right thing to do and we do them. I am here [TIME] because there is no place else in [GPE] I would rather be [TIME] than here in this cause for this good man. You know, before I got here I really did not understand how things so often came across in the country so different than they are up here. I was another alienated [NORP], even though I was the Governor of my State. And I was terribly worried that this country was going in the wrong direction, that the people that were running our country were just telling the voters what they thought they wanted to hear and avoiding all the tough problemswe had had profound social problems building up for [DATE], we'd had serious economic problems building up for [DATE] we had finally come to the end of the cold war, a time when we had an opportunity to take a fresh look at both the opportunities and the difficulties of this country at this time, and that we had a window here in which we could either secure the [NORP] dream for our children and our grandchildren and the strength of this country as we move into [DATE], or we could walk away from the responsibilities of our generation. When I talked to [PERSON] about running for President, Iin a very personal way, I did not really want to do it. First of all, most of my friends thought it was a fool's errand because the incumbent President was at [PERCENT] approval. Secondly, things were going pretty well for us at home, with our family, our friends, and our work. But I did it because I thought that we all have an obligation to try to make a difference and that we had to change the direction of the country. [TIME] we come here to honor someone who has always fought to keep us going forward in the right direction, who has always fought for hope over fear, for reconciliation over division, to bring out the best in us instead of to bring out the worst in us. Well, when I came here I knew it would not be easy, but I was determined to see that we work together to move this country forward, to address our problems, to get things done for ordinary [NORP]. Well, it has not been easy. There have been some tough times and some really brutal fights. But you know, we have made a good start. And now, as always happens in these midterm elections, with the issue hanging fire, the [NORP] people will have to decide whether we will continue this rigorous transition into [DATE]. Every time we reach a point in history where we are going through big changes and the future is not clear, we fight a battle within ourselves. In that sense, our Nation is very much like a person. If you think about your own life, whenever you did anything really different and took on a new challenge, it was always with a mixture of hope and fear, when you went to school the first day or first went off to college or had your first job or first sought elective office or married or had your first child. No matter how good a thing is, if it is really big, it is also a little scary. Countries are the same way. A delicate balance always has to be maintained between hope and fear. And [DATE] we all get up and we see things that are happening that we do not like or we are unsure what will happen to us. And it is almost as if we have a scale inside us, with blind justice holding it, and hope is on one side and fear is on the other. And [DATE] it may take a little different balance. The job we have [DATE] is to make sure that when people wake up on [DATE], they vote their hopes instead of their fears, they vote for [DATE] instead of [DATE], they vote to keep going forward, and they vote for Senator [PERSON] for reelection in [GPE]. We still have a lot to do, but we have made a good start. And we have done some very important things by putting our economic house in order, giving the [NORP] people their first serious attack on crime in a long time, and beginning to make this Government work for ordinary citizens. If you look at [DATE], this CongressI might add, without [CARDINAL] single, solitary vote from a member of the other partythe [NORP], who were so often attacked as being for big Government and spending, voted for a budget that cut [MONEY] in [ORG] spending, that reduced the deficit by more than any plan ever adopted in the history of the country, that gave us [DATE] of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since [PERSON] was President. I might add, they did it by raising tax rates on only the top 1.2 percent of [NORP], including most of you in this room [TIME]. And we thank you for staying with us. This administrationand it is a great rebuke to those who think people only vote their own short-term self-interests; all of you are. And I honor you for your presence here [TIME] and for caring about your country and the long-term health and discipline and economic direction of what we are trying to do. Our administration expanded trade by more than any in the comparable time period in [DATE]. Exports are up, sales are up, and jobs are up in export-related areas. And what has all this produced: [CARDINAL] new jobs, [PERCENT] of them in the private sector, unlike the ratio in [DATE] when it is been mostly [ORG] jobs created to try to help people deal with the problems of economic fallout. We have had [DATE] of manufacturing job growth in a row for the first time in [DATE]. And [DATE], at the [DATE] vote of International Economists, for the first time in [DATE], it was [GPE] that was voted as having the most productive economy in the world. We have got a long way to go, but we have made a good beginning. Senator [PERSON] is here. And Senator [PERSON] for [DATE] has been interested in this whole crime issue from his service on [ORG]. But [PERSON] will tell you they talked about crime around here for [DATE], but we finally passed the crime bill that is tough with punishment, tough in terms of putting [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] police on the street, but also smart in providing prevention and giving people a chance to turn away from lives of crime and giving our young people a chance to have something to say yes to. Also, for the first time in my memory we put together back-to-back victories with the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban, in spite of the ferocious opposition of the [ORG]. That is a pretty good beginning. We have got a long way to go, but it is a pretty good beginning. If you look at what was done to make Government work for ordinary people, in the economic plan, we reformed the college loan program the Secretary of [ORG] is here [TIME] making [CARDINAL] [NORP], including [CARDINAL] in the State of [GPE], eligible for low-interest loans at longer repayment terms, a stunning benefit for middle class kids, not just poor kids, so that no one need ever walk away from the challenge of paying for a college education againyou can clap for that; [PERSON] was for it. [Applause] We have [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] more children in [ORG]; [CARDINAL] of people in [GPE] alone affected by the family leave law which says that if you have got a sick parent or you are about to have a child, you can take a little time off work without losing your job. We are going to have [CARDINAL] more children immunized by [DATE], so that all the kids [DATE] will be immunized and parents can go to work not worrying about whether their children are going to be safe from preventable childhood diseases. [CARDINAL] working people and their children are going to get income tax cuts because they work hard and they raise their kids but they are hovering just above the poverty line, and we do not want them to fall into the poverty line and quit working and go on welfare. This is a pro-work, pro-family administration making this Government work for ordinary citizens again. And it is a good start. Finally, let me say to our friends in the other party, I sat out there in the heartland of [GPE] as the Governor for [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE], and I heard them talk about how terrible [ORG] was and how big and bloated it was. But we, the [NORP], voted to reduce the size of [ORG] by [CARDINAL][CARDINAL], to make it the smallest it is been since President [PERSON] was in office. We have already done [CARDINAL], 000 of those reductions. And every last red cent of reduction in [ORG] is going to local government and to local communities to help them fight crime. That is the record of the [NORP] in [DATE]. Now, if you compare that to what our opponents have done and what they have said, it is a pretty big difference. In the name of partisanship, they tried to stop the crime bill. They voted entirely against the economic program, a program that gave college loan breaks to [CARDINAL] of kids, a program that made [PERCENT] of the small businesses in this country eligible for tax cuts and gave tax reductions to [CARDINAL] working families. They have done everything they could to keep us from addressing the health care reform issue in a serious way. You needn't take my word for it, only listen to them: Congressman [PERSON] from [GPE] saying that they had all been ordered not to cooperate and compromise on health care; a [NORP] Senator quoted in [CARDINAL] of our big newspapers [DATE] saying, We killed health care, now if we can just not get our fingerprints on it ; their political adviser, Mr. [PERSON], telling them the [CARDINAL] thing they must not do is to cooperate to bring down health care costs, make health insurance secure for those who have it, and cover those who do not because that would be a political benefit for the other party. That is their record. Now we know what they wish to do if they get the majority. They put out their Contract With America, and you know what they did? It looks like a contract; it looks like they took out a contract against the deficit, a contract against [ORG], a contract against paying for the crime bill, a contract against all the gains we have made for ordinary [NORP] in [DATE]. They want to go back to the way they did it before, explode the deficit, tell people what they want to hear, and stick it to ordinary [NORP]. We can do better than that. We have to go forward. We have to reelect the people and elect the people who want to keep going forward. If you just look at the things that Senator [PERSON] has been involved in just since I have been Presidentthe Head Start program, [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] more children; reforming the education loans; working on changing the whole unemployment system to a reemployment system, something we have not finished yet; the Goals 2000 bill, which for the first time in the history of [GPE] commits us as a nation to world-class standards of educational excellence and commits [ORG] not to have a bureaucracy but to give help to local grassroots efforts at reform; the national service program, which [DATE] has [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] young [NORP] and [DATE] will have [CARDINAL] 000 young [NORP] earning their way to a higher education by serving their communities at the grassroots level, not in a bureaucracy but in people power that can truly change the course of our country's futurehe led the way in all of those endeavors. And he deserves a lot of credit for it. But elections are about the future. If we do a good job, it is just what we were hired to do. So why should he be reelected? Because if you ever want this country to be able to bring the deficit down without breaking the backs of our senior citizens; if you ever want to see a time when working people will be secure in their insurance, instead of the situation which exists todaythis is the only advanced country in the world where working families are losing ground in insurance coverage. There are [CARDINAL] [NORP] in working families [DATE] who had health insurance [DATE] who do not have it [DATE], even though we spend [PERCENT] more of our income than any other country on health care. If you want to preserve the integrity of our great medical institutions of higher learning, if you want to see health insurance for all [NORP] and stability in our economy long-term and in our Federal budget long-term, we have got to address the health care issue. So what if we could not do it in [DATE]. Look what is happened since I have been here. It took [DATE] to pass the Brady bill, [DATE] to pass family leave, [DATE] to pass motor voter, [DATE] to pass the crime bill. I signed a banking reform bill [DATE] that they have been working on longer than anybody can remember. We can do this. We will do this. The people of [GPE], I do not believe, want to send a signal to [GPE], [GPE], that they have abandoned health care. I think they want to tell us to keep at it until we get it right. And the only way to do that is to say, Senator [PERSON], stay on the job; keep doing it until we get it right. My friends, you will see this election everywhere in [GPE] played out. Look at [PERSON] race in [GPE]. He is running against someone who signed the contract, a contract against health care reform, for cutting [ORG], for exploding the deficit, for putting the [ORG] budget in a place where they will not even be able to fund the crime billthe same old promises, tell them what they want to hear, bad-mouth Government, bad-mouth the people who are the instruments of change, and hope you do not get caught. I think the [NORP] people are smarter than that. You know, [PERSON] said [TIME] that he was not the youngest man in the [ORG] race. He was once the youngest man in the [ORG] for quite a long time. Well, I was once the youngest Governor in [GPE] by [DATE]. Time has a way of curing those problemsand of changing your perspective. But I would like to say something about Senator [PERSON] and about [GPE]. He is made enemies in his life because he has fought for things. But the things he has fought for are things that would help people who are very different from him. [PERCENT] of the people that would have been given the things that he was given in life never would have spent their life trying to get all that for everybody else in the country. Most of us, given the opportunities he had, would have enjoyed them in a very different way. They would not have put themselves on the line day in and day out, year in and [DATE] out. This country is also very old as a democracy, but it is forever young. When people say they worry about whether we have still got it as a country, I say to them: Why do you think the [NORP] and the [NORP] want to come here and have us work with them to end the [DATE] of horrible fighting in the Middle East? Why do you think that after literally [DATE] of fighting, the [NORP] and the [NORP] in [GPE], and the [NORP] and the [NORP] wish the [NORP] to be involved in the peace process? Why did Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] want [GPE] to spend [MONEY] of our tax money to help them develop an election that would really work? Even in [TIME] of our crisis in [GPE] [DATE], when the delegation was down there meeting with the military leaders and they realized finally that we meant business, [CARDINAL] of them said, Well, if the President is determined to do this and [ORG] is determined to act, at least we want [GPE] here; we trust them, we know they can be trusted. We know what they represent. Why? Because the right things, my fellow [NORP], never get old. And I was sitting here looking at [PERSON] give that speech [DATE], and I saw it literally moving his entire being. And I said to myself, let the people who disagree with him disagree. Let the people who say he is wrong on the issues say that. But let no one doubt that he may be the youngest person running for the [ORG] in any State [DATE], because he believes in things that are forever young.

And I want to thank the [GPE] delegation: [PERSON], who is been a friend for a long time; and [PERSON], who is a really close friend; and an outstanding Congressman, [PERSON], and other elected officials that are here. Look, all of whom fight for working people, in [GPE] and in every-and every other State. Because if it happens here, it happens around the world-happens around the country. It is been an honor to be with the ironworkers of [ORG]. And we talk about building a future that is made in [GPE]. We are talking about you. And this time we are going to get it really correct. You know, [CARDINAL] of the press persons said to me-and I cannot remember who-[DATE], that-I do not know if it is factual or not, but he said, You have used the word 'union' as President more than any other President in [NORP] history. So let me tell you: I am not sure that it is true. Participant. It is true! [SPEAKER]. But I tell you what: I promised you you'd have a union President. And I am, because you are the best. You know, we talk about whether Wall Street built [GPE]. There are good folks on Wall Street; they are not bad folks. There are good people all over the country. I tell you who built [GPE]: the middle class. And the people who built the middle class are organized labor-unions, unions. Unions did it. That is not hyperbole. That is a fact. That is a straight fact. And the Executive order I am going to sign [DATE] is going to help ensure that we build a better [GPE], we build it right and we build it on time and we build it cheaper than it would have been otherwise. You know, the Executive order is making sure that [ORG] construction projects get completed on time and under budget, saving taxpayers money, clearing construction zones quickly, and ensuring that everything [ORG] signs to contract to build is built to last. You guys really, genuinely, are the best in the world. Not-that is not hyperbole. It is a fact. To do that, we are using a tool that ironworkers here know very well, called project labor agreements. I know you all know it, but folks who may be watching this may not fully understand it. Simply put, these are agreements that contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before a construction site gets underway, before the construction begins. They ensure that major projects are handled by well-trained, well-prepared, highly skilled workers, and they ward off problems. They resolve disputes ahead of time, ensuring safer work sites, avoiding disruptions and work stoppages that can cause expensive delays down the line. And that makes a big difference for the [NORP] taxpayer. Because when big construction projects are completed efficiently and with the highest degree of professionalism, it is good for the [NORP] taxpayer. That is not hyperbole; that is a fact. We do not talk about it though. We do not talk about how you all save the [NORP] taxpayers money. It is good for families who live in those communities. All across the country, the [ORG] construction projects are being built as I speak. And it means that modernization of your local waterways will get done sooner, will not cost twice as much as expected. And when the next storm comes, the power will more likely stay on and homes and businesses will be better protected from flooding. It means new air traffic control towers at the local airports will be up and running more quickly, so flights are safer at the airports and more efficient. It means new housing will be built on our military bases; will be of the highest quality, which these servicemembers deserve. It will hold up better and make life easier for our military families. The Executive order I am going to sign will help defuse problems before they arise. They are going to improve coordination between contractors, subcontractors, and workers on the job site. It is going to help guarantee a consistent supply of high-quality, highly trained workers. You know, what people do not understand if they are not-do not know the industry is, you know, it is like you going to college, kid. [DATE]. [DATE] of busting your neck, learning a trade. This is not something you walk up and show up in a day and raise your hand, I need a job. You work like the devil for it. Fortunately, you get paid while you are doing it, and you are able to do it, but it is an education-full-blown education you are getting in your trade. Well, you will have a voice on the work site, full commitment to getting the job done. And it is going to raise the bar on quality for some of those vital projects we are going to be building. And we are going to make sure that [ORG] construction projects are staffed with good-paying union jobs. [CARDINAL] of you actually came up to me [DATE] and said, [PERSON], you said you are going to do that, and you are doing it. Well, when President [PERSON] asked me to run the Recovery Act, I made sure every single job I could get was a union job, prevailing wage. Because I have noticed when folks are getting paid a decent wage, everybody in the community does better, everything looks better. They are jobs you can raise a family on. Or as my dad would say, They are jobs you can put your head on the pillow at [TIME] and just have a little breathing room -a little security, a little breathing room. Jobs that cannot be outsourced. And that is good for [CARDINAL], 000 workers on [ORG] construction contracts right now. It is good for everybody. I do not want to get going because I will keep you here too long, because you know all of what I am about to-what I have said, and you know what I have done, and you know what we are doing, and you know what-I know what you are doing. But let me close with this: [DATE], I went to [GPE] to tour a former steel mill that is now a cutting-edge manufacturing research and development hub. Right before I left to the trip, I got word that a bridge collapsed. You saw it on television. It looked as bad in person as it did at the time. The bridge had been rated in poor condition, like, I might add, over [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] bridges in [GPE], [CARDINAL] across the Nation. It had been rated that way for [DATE]. When I got there, folks told me something close to a miracle had occurred. Because of a snowstorm [TIME], school openings were late and commutes were delayed. So when that bridge collapsed-and it was [QUANTITY] off the-[CARDINAL]-almost [CARDINAL]-I do not -I did not -I do not know the exact, but probably from down to the creek that it went over and the ravine, probably [QUANTITY]. When it collapsed, instead of a bus with a couple people on it-being packed with school buses full of children, the people on their way to work on the bridge that is one of the busiest bridges-you know, there are more bridges in [GPE] than any other city in the world; with the [CARDINAL] rivers-the bridge was empty, relatively empty. Fortunately, no one was killed, but for a snowstorm. Just imagine the challenges we face and the opportunities to build a better [GPE], and extend it far beyond roads and bridges now that we can-know we have to do. We passed that infrastructure bill. But it is not just that. Across the country right now there are countless buildings, ports, airports, power stations, and other [ORG] construction projects that need to be modernized and built for the future. We cannot count on miracles, like happened in-out in [GPE], to prevent tragedies that are waiting in plain sight. But what we can count on, what [GPE] has always counted on: the [NORP] worker, the hardest working, best trained workers in the world; [NORP] workers who, given just half a chance, have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down, and gotten the job done. And that is what [DATE] is all about, in my view: getting the job done for the [NORP] taxpayers, getting the job done right the first time. You know, folks, there is a law that is existed for a long time that has too many exceptions like this one had, and that is that-buy [NORP]. As [SPEAKER] of [GPE], I award contracts. And I am now making it the case-and it is working; it is one of the reasons those jobs were up-is unless the product that I am purchasing for the [NORP] people was made in [GPE] and all of its component parts are made in [GPE], we ain't buying it. We are just simply not buying it. And what is going to happen here-not a joke; it is a fact. It is not a violation of any international laws either. What we are talking about here, with [CARDINAL] exceptions I will not bore you with-and they are highly unusual-but with [CARDINAL] exceptions: Every single project that we are talking about that is paid for with [ORG] dollars and is a [ORG] project, it is going to be union jobs, every single one of them. The last time we tried it, there were so many exceptions, I think [CARDINAL] jobs-[inaudible]. There are going to be [CARDINAL] of people put to work. Not a joke. I mean, this is serious. And guess what? The [NORP] public's going to be safer, and it is going to be cheaper-cheaper paying the right wage and the right trained people to begin with and get the job done right and on time. So I am about to walk over and sign an Executive order that is going to make that happen. And we are going to start once that order is signed. Just remember: It ain't labor, it is unions. Thank you. Now, usually you have a pen to give out to everybody around you, but we did not have enough pens to bring with us. So I am going to sign this order, but you are all going to get one of the signing pens, starting with the [GPE] delegation. [Laughter] [At this point, [SPEAKER] signed the Executive order.] There you go. Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. I think all of you can see before me the results of a tremendous amount of work and cooperation among all those in our Government who are interested in the present and future strength of our Nation's number [CARDINAL] economic resource, and that is agriculture. I think it is also accurate to point out that more than has ever been the case in the past, that professional nutritionists and their representatives, private citizens, consumer groups, have been involved in the preparation of this legislation. Another fact that I think would be undisputed is that in [DATE], there has never been such a far-reaching and important piece of legislation passed relating to [NORP] agriculture. There is been a heavy emphasis in this bill on the strength of the [NORP] farm family. This is an important concept for us all. We are very eager to continue our preeminent position in international agricultural trade circles. Public Law 480, which permits us to dispose of [NORP] food products in a beneficial way, is enhanced. Foreign trade with the sale of our own agricultural commodities is enhanced. We have in this bill, too, a new approach to the food stamp question. This has sometimes been considered as an anomaly or an anachronism in a [DATE] [ORG]. But I think this legislation that has been included in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 is a great step forward in providing a simple food stamp system and [CARDINAL] that would be easy to administer, one that is more equitable, which eliminates the pervasive threat of fraud. I'd also like to point out that this bill includes many other features--a renewed emphasis and an enhancement of our research program in agriculture that is so important to every family. It, for the first time, makes a major step toward tying target prices to actual production costs. This has been one of the most controversial issues that the [ORG] has had to face. Obviously, because production costs vary so widely from [CARDINAL] community to another, and a bill of this kind has to deal with average prices or cost of production throughout the country, there still remain and will inevitably remain some inequities. But this bill makes a giant step toward tying target prices with production costs, and it also narrows its focus on individual commodities so that there can be more equity insured. This bill also sets up a means for maintaining adequate food reserves. Although we have been blessed recently with bountiful crops, we do not have an excessive reserve supply of crucial food and feed items on hand. This bill permits us to maintain adequate reserves, and it also encompasses a provision that is very dear to me, and that is that most of the reserves will be under the control of farmers and that there is a very careful safeguard against the dumping of agricultural products on the market, artificially, to force prices down and, therefore, to damage the economy of farm families. We have moved in this bill to correct a very serious economic problem that exists among the farm communities of our Nation by increasing target and loan prices for the [DATE] crop. And I believe that this will certainly be a good investment both [DATE] and in the future. Another aspect of this bill that particularly , appeals to me is the reduction of Government interference in the agricultural economy. This is always devoutly to be sought, and I think the [ORG] has very wisely achieved this goal in this current legislation. We have eliminated acreage allotments. Quite often in the past, acreage allotments historically have evolved into a financial measure of the benefit of Government programs, and they are bought and traded like actual property. This bill moves to eliminate those acreage allotments. We have also maintained an important element in the set-aside authority for the [ORG] Secretary. And very shortly now, set-aside regulations will be promulgated by this [ORG]. I have to admit that the bill is [MONEY] more costly than I had personally preferred to see. But I think the investment is a good one. And I think the cost of this bill, because of its wise drafting, will be less and less as [DATE] go by. We have an exceptional case at the present time in agriculture, where additional expenditures are required. [CARDINAL] of the elements of agricultural legislation and appropriations which is often overlooked is that [CARDINAL] the costs that are normally attributed to an agricultural bill are actually in the form of redeemable loans. And this is not an expenditure from [ORG]; it is an investment in a very good and sound commodity. The loan is secured and the loans are repaid, but under our present accounting system, this is identified as an expenditure, and it tends to distort in the public mind the degree of [ORG] investment in agriculture. I'd like to close by saying that I am very proud of the good work that has been done [DATE], and in [DATE], by Senator [PERSON], the chairman of the [ORG] committee and, of course, by [PERSON] and [PERSON] and all those [NORP] and [NORP] who've worked with them, both within the committee and on the floor of [ORG]. These have been tedious studies and negotiations. [PERSON] and his staff in [ORG] have worked very harmoniously with the congressional leaders. And as [SPEAKER] of our country, as a farmer myself, as someone who feels a direct responsibility to the consumers of this country, I am very proud now to affix my signature onto the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 and ratify into law [CARDINAL] of the most progressive and far-reaching pieces of legislation that has come before me. Thank you very much, all of you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthebilldesignatingthecentennialyearlibertytheunitedstates", "text": "[CARDINAL] very nice young people. I will speak about them in [TIME]. [PERSON], chairman of [ORG], honored guests, and ladies and gentlemen, on this date in [DATE], President [PERSON] stood on an island in New York Harbor to dedicate a statue entitled Liberty Enlightening the World. [DATE], the statue is known by a more familiar affectionate name, the Statue of Liberty or simply Miss Liberty. She is cherished across [GPE], and the torch that she bears is recognized throughout the world as a symbol of human freedom. The Statue of Liberty was conceived and created by the [NORP] sculptor [PERSON]. Legend has it that as he worked, he modeled the statue's face-that face of utter calm and nobility-on the features of his own mother. Completed, the statue rose [QUANTITY] and was constructed of [QUANTITY] of hand-hammered copper sheathing hung on an iron frame engineered by [PERSON], who later designed [FAC]. On [DATE], the statue was presented to the [NORP] Ambassador to [GPE]. Built using funds donated by the [NORP] people, she was then dismantled and shipped to [GPE]. Then, she was rebuilt using funds donated by the [NORP] people, including money raised by schoolchildren. Ever since, she is stood on her island in that great harbor lighting the way to freedom. [QUANTITY] away, there is a second island, Ellis Island. [DATE], [CARDINAL] immigrants to the New World passed through the Ellis Island checkpoint. Most immigrants moved through the checkpoint in a few hours to begin their new lives in [GPE] and freedom. And I like to picture the scene as a boatload of immigrants leaving Ellis Island for [GPE], they pass Miss Liberty and crowd the rails to gaze. Someone on board knows English, he reads and translates the inscription that the statue bears, words that have proclaimed the meaning of [GPE] for [CARDINAL] of immigrants, for shiploads of returning soldiers in [CARDINAL] great wars, for every family that has ever visited that glorious statue. And those words: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost, to me. I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door. Well, many of those immigrants remain at the rails until Miss [PERSON] is lost in the fog. It would be no surprise if some shed tears of joy. In [DATE], it became all too apparent that [FAC] and Miss [PERSON], herself, were being ravaged by the passing of [DATE]. [CARDINAL] of all [NORP] can trace their ancestry to someone who passed through the [FAC] checkpoint. But that island, which should be a proud memorial to our forbearers, had instead become a sad and ramshackled place. Miss [PERSON], for her part, had been badly corroded by [DATE] of salt air; her iron supports had weakened; in places, she'd become pocked with jagged, rusty holes. Well, then, in [DATE] the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation was formed to restore Miss Liberty and rebuild Ellis Island, and to do so with private funds. This effort has become one of the largest private sector initiatives in [NORP] history. Across [GPE], everyone is lending a hand; major corporations are making contributions; small businesses are helping out. And I am pleased to say that just as schoolchildren helped raise the money to build her pedestal and install Miss [PERSON] back in [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], they are holding bake sales and car washes to see to it that she gets the restoration she needs. Let me give you [CARDINAL] of many stirring examples. [PERSON], of [GPE], [GPE], has raised [MONEY] 000 for the statue by going door to door with an appeal to help Miss [PERSON]. Well, I am proud to be in [PERSON]'s company here in the Rose Garden [DATE]. And then, there is [PERSON], of [GPE], [GPE], who brought a jar of [CARDINAL] pennies into her first-grade class to help raise money for the Statue of Liberty. The pennies had been collected [DATE] by [PERSON]'s mother, who, day by day, put one into a jar to mark the time that her fianc was in [GPE]. And now, after all these years, they felt it was only appropriate to give these special coins to Lady [PERSON], who symbolizes what [PERSON]'s dad fought for freedom. Well, I am very happy that [PERSON], her mother, and father are here with us [DATE]. And finally, there is [PERSON], a [DATE] from [GPE], [GPE]. When [PERSON]'s hometown learned that she was losing her sight to an incurable eye disease, they pitched in to raise money to send her and her family to visit the Statue of Liberty. However, [PERSON], in the spirit of generosity, donated part of this contribution to [ORG]. And, [PERSON], you are a fine example to us all. So far, this private sector initiative has raised [MONEY], well on its way to its goal of [CARDINAL]. [DATE] Miss Liberty and [FAC] are surrounded by scaffolding; workers are on the sites [TIME] a day. Among countless other repairs, they are giving the statue new iron supports and fitting her pedestal with the tallest hydraulic elevator in [GPE]. On [FAC], they are giving the main building a new roof, replacing the copper towers, and completely restoring the interiors. Much has been accomplished, but there is still a great deal to be done in order to reopen Ellis Island and [FAC] by the only appropriate date-[DATE]. And mindful of this need, the [ORG] has passed a resolution which it is my honor to sign [DATE]. The resolution reads in part: Whereas, the nation will celebrate [FAC] 100th anniversary through commemorative events scheduled to take place during [DATE] in [DATE], and on [DATE]; now therefore be it resolved-that the [DATE] period ending on [DATE] is designated as [DATE] of liberty... Well, I am looking forward to attending the Liberty Weekend celebration [DATE] and the hundredth anniversary [DATE]. [PERSON], who is producing the Liberty Weekend activities, has promised to outdo himself, which will not be easy, after seeing the superb job he did with the [DATE] [DATE] and the [DATE] Olympics. And Ambassador [PERSON] has planned quite a display himself with the tall ships of Operation Sail. Throughout [DATE], let us join in the great work of restoring [FAC] and [FAC], perhaps our nation's most moving and powerful symbols of freedom. And drawing inspiration from these symbols, let us rededicate ourselves to the great cause of human liberty throughout the world. I thank you, and God bless you. And now I am going to sign that resolution.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthetradeact2002", "text": "Well, thank you all very much for that warm welcome. Welcome to the people's house as we celebrate a victory for the [NORP] economy. [DATE], [ORG] [ORG] passed trade promotion authority and renewed and expanded the Andean Trade Preference Act. Trade is an important source of good jobs for our workers and a source of higher growth for our economy. Trade is an important source of earnings for our farmers and for our factories. It creates new opportunities for our entrepreneurs. Trade expands choices for [GPE]'s consumers and raises living standards for our families. And now, after [DATE], [GPE] is back in the business of promoting open trade to build our prosperity and to spur economic growth. I appreciate so very much Vice President [PERSON]'s hard work on this issue. I appreciate [PERSON] and [PERSON], who ably serve in my [ORG]. I want to particularly thank [PERSON], who is not with us, and [PERSON], members of my [ORG] who both worked tirelessly to get the vote in the [ORG] and then in the [ORG], and I appreciate [PERSON] as well. These [ORG] Secretaries worked hard for trade. They understand the promise of trade, and I appreciate their hard work on behalf of [NORP] workers and farmers. I particularly want to thank the Members of [ORG] who are here with us, starting with the chairman of [ORG], the Senator from [GPE], [PERSON]. [PERSON] did fantastic work to get this trade bill through the [ORG] and was then able to work with Chairman [PERSON]. [Laughter] Chairman [PERSON] was heroic in the [ORG]. He was steadfast in his support for trade, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue. And I want to thank both Members of [ORG], [CARDINAL] [NORP], [CARDINAL] [NORP], who put their country ahead of their parties to do what was right for the people of this country. You [CARDINAL] deserve a lot of congratulations. I want to thank Senator [PERSON], who was a conferee and a member of [ORG]. Thanks for coming, Senator. I want to thank my fellow [NORP] [PERSON], the best vote-counter in the history of [ORG]. [Laughter] After all, he was able to triple-[laughter]-the vote margin on final passage. I appreciate so very much [PERSON] and a guy I call [PERSON], [PERSON], Congressmen from [GPE] and [GPE], and I want to thank them for their work as well. They led the [NORP] in [ORG], many of whom are here [DATE], to do what is right for our country. And again, I appreciate your leadership, and I appreciate your work, and I appreciate your help. I want to thank [PERSON] from [GPE]. I want to thank you for coming. I also want to thank [PERSON] from [GPE] and all the other ambassadors who are here. I want to appreciate you-appreciate your hard work on sending the message of trade to Members of our [ORG]. I want to thank you for your diligence, and I want to thank your [SPEAKER]s for their care and concern about this incredibly important initiative, not only for [NORP] but for workers all around the world. Thank you all for coming. With trade promotion authority, the trade agreements I negotiate will have an up-or-down vote in [ORG], giving other countries the confidence to negotiate with us. [CARDINAL] Presidents before me had this advantage, but since the authority elapsed in [DATE], other nations and regions have pursued new trade agreements while [GPE]'s trade policy was stuck in park. With [DATE], [GPE] has lost trading opportunities and the jobs and earnings that go with them. Starting now, [GPE] is back at the bargaining table in full force. I will use trade promotion authority aggressively to create more good jobs for [NORP] workers, more exports for [NORP] farmers, and higher living standards for [NORP] families. Free trade has a proven track record for spurring growth and advancing opportunity for our working families. Exports accounted for [CARDINAL] of all [GPE] economic growth in [DATE]. Jobs in exporting plants pay wages that are up to 18 percent higher than jobs in nonexporting plants. And our [CARDINAL] major trade agreements, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, have created more choices and lower prices for consumers while raising standards of living for the typical [NORP] family of [CARDINAL] by $[MONEY], 000 a year. [GPE] will build on this record of success. A completely free global market for agricultural products, for example, would result in gains of [MONEY] a year for [NORP] farmers and consumers. Lowering global trade barriers on all products and services by even [CARDINAL] could boost the [GPE] economy by [MONEY] a year and raise living standards for the average family by [MONEY] [DATE]. In other words, trade is good for the [NORP] people, and I am going to use the trade promotion authority to bring these benefits to the [NORP] people. Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global prosperity and adding to the momentum of political freedom. Trade is an engine of economic growth. It uses the power of markets to meet the needs of the poor. In [DATE], trade has helped lift [CARDINAL] of people and whole nations and entire regions out of poverty and put them on the path to prosperity. History shows that as nations become more prosperous, their citizens will demand and then can-and can afford a cleaner environment. And greater freedom for commerce across the borders eventually leads to greater freedom for citizens within the borders. The members of the diplomatic corps with us [DATE] understand the importance of free trade to their nations' success. They understand that trade is an enemy of poverty and a friend of liberty. I want to thank the ambassadors for their role in getting this bill passed, especially the [NORP] ambassadors, who are such strong advocates for the Andean Trade Preference Act. By providing trade preference for products from [CARDINAL] [NORP] democracies, we will build prosperity, reduce poverty, strengthen democracy, and fight illegal drugs with expanding economic opportunity. Trade promotion authority gives [GPE] an important tool to break down trade barriers with all countries. We will move quickly to build free trade relationships with individual nations, such as [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE]. We will explore free trade relationships with others, such as [GPE]. [GPE] will negotiate [GPE] and pursue regional agreements with the nations of Central America and [ORG]. We will move forward globally, working with all nations to make the negotiations begun [DATE] in [GPE] a success. A little more than a week ago, [GPE] put forward a far-reaching proposal to lower worldwide agricultural trade barriers. These innovative set of ideas can lead to real progress in this challenging area. Trade gives all nations the hope of sharing in the great economic and social and political progress of [DATE]. And trade will give [NORP] workers the hope that comes from better and higher paying jobs. [GPE]'s committed to building a world that trades in freedom and grows in prosperity and liberty. [DATE] we have the tools to pursue that vision, and I look forward to the work ahead. And now it is my honor and pleasure to sign into law the Trade Act of [DATE].", "discourse_type": 0}

I was talking to Senator [PERSON] about the crime bill. I am very interested in getting a comprehensive crime package through, and I hope that, with your help, we can do it. I realize the odds are a little difficult, but we want to get that done. I wanted to mention the veto strategy that [PERSON] and [PERSON] and so many of you have been active in. And it is very important because when we are in a minority, the only way we are going to get something done is to beat down the bad idea before they give us a shot at a good idea.

These are all very important. I am leaving out some. I would make a pitch for our education strategy, [GPE] 2000. Actually, that is being received very, very well across the country. And the Governors, regardless of party, are extraordinarily supportive. I think at the grassroots level, people are beginning to understand that we are not just trying to add more money to a program in [GPE], but we have got to revolutionize these schools -- create brand-new schools. It is an exciting prospect, and I urge your strong support. Later, we will have a chance to visit a little bit on what is happening overseas. But I just wanted to click off these domestic items because they are vital. I am sick and tired of people saying we do not have a domestic agenda, because they have got their eyes closed and they do not want to hear -- because we have got a good one.

You have heard Secretary [PERSON] mention some of the things we have done together. We have worked with [GPE] to expand [ORG] to [CARDINAL] [NORP] who previously had no insurance. We reached across party lines to enact the Kassebaum-Kennedy law that provides that working families will not lose their insurance when they change jobs, increased the health care tax deduction for [CARDINAL] self-employed [NORP]. And now in our budget plan, we have funds sufficiently targeted to extend coverage to [CARDINAL] of our [CARDINAL] [NORP] children who still do not have medical coverage. We have worked to constrain costs. [DATE], I announced a new effort to combat the [MONEY] problem of fraud and abuse in [ORG] and [ORG]. Our balanced budget proposal also strengthens [ORG] through savings and overdue structural reforms. Of course, we are not alone in this. The private sector has found ways to rein in costs, sometimes dramatically. And in many cases, changes in the health care delivery system have, frankly, also improved its quality. For example, the growing recognition of the value of preventive care, such as mammography screening, is saving and extending lives and the quality of life. This is all very encouraging. Step by step we have been working to expand access to health care, and [DATE] we take the next step. In this time of transition, many [NORP] worry that lower costs mean lower quality and less attention to their rights. On balance, however, managed health care plans, HMO's, PPO's, and others, give patients good care and greater choice at lower cost. Still, we must make sure that these changes do not keep health professionals from offering the best and the most medically appropriate services to their patients. Managed care managed well can be the best deal for our families. Whether they have traditional health care or managed care, none of our people should ever have inferior care. I am proud that the [ORG] and [ORG] programs have taken the lead in responding to the quality concerns of both patients and health care providers, as Secretary [PERSON] has just described. But we are learning the defining, measuring, and enforcing quality is far from a simple task. There are many complicated issues. They require thoughtful study. And not surprisingly, there are many areas where broad-based consensus on how best to proceed does not yet exist. That is why I decided [DATE] to establish [ORG] in the Health Care Industry. [DATE] I am happy to introduce the members of that [ORG] to the [NORP] people. They are a highly distinguished, broad-based, and diverse group. They represent consumers, business, labor, health care providers, insurers, managed care plans, [ORG] and local governments, health care quality experts. Their specialties are wide-ranging, including care for children, the elderly, women, people with disabilities, mental illness, or AIDS. This [ORG] includes some of the best health care policy minds in our Nation and a lot of people with hands-on experience. Its task will be as challenging as it is critical. [DATE], to assure that they get busy right away, I am charging the [ORG] to develop a consumer bill of rights so that health care patients get the information and care they need when they need it. Let us assure that patients and their families-first, that the health care professionals who are treating them are free to provide the best medical advice available; second, that their providers are not subject to inappropriate financial incentives to limit care; third, that our sickest and most vulnerable patients, frequently the elderly and people with disabilities, are receiving the best medical care for their unique needs; fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures for resolving health care coverage disputes with plans; fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic information about their rights and responsibilities, about the plans-the benefits the plans offer, about how to access the health care they need, and about the quality of their providers and their health care plans. I am delighted that the Secretary of [ORG] and the Secretary of Labor will take on the task of being the [ORG]'s [ORG]. I look forward to reviewing their first report at [DATE] and their final report [DATE]. The need for this [ORG] is real. It is urgent. It will give us a roadmap to help us make our way through the time of rapid change we now see in our health care system. There are few people in the [ORG] better suited to the task than the members of this [ORG]. And again, let me say, I want to thank them for their commitment to serve. And to all the rest of you let me say, [CARDINAL] of the things, [CARDINAL] of the many things I have learned in [DATE] as [SPEAKER] is that a distinguished commission, broadly based with a clear mandate, can make a profound positive difference for our country. In the health care related areas, I ask you to think of [CARDINAL]. Think of the work done by [ORG] and what we now know that we did not know when they started to meet and work. Think of the remarkable work done by the [ORG] that dealt with those who were exposed to human radiation experiments [DATE] here and the work that they have done. There is a peculiar way in which the citizens of [GPE], when brought together around a clear mandate, interfacing with their Government and with the private sector, can do more than either the Government or the private sector could do alone. And so again, let me say, I am very hopeful about this [ORG]. I look forward to their progress on the consumer's bill of rights. I look forward to all the work that they do. And I ask you to join me in thanking them for their willingness to serve. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthebreakfastlosangelesgivenrepublicangroupssoutherncalifornia", "text": "AboutSearch Governor [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], and my friends: This meeting, insofar as it involves a talk from me, is sort of an added number on my schedule. I have no text, and I think I have no particularly brilliant ideas. But I must say that the great pleasure of meeting with a group of people that you know to be friendly, who wish well to you and to the cause for which you struggle, is a very warm feeling. And this inspires me to tell you a little bit of what we are trying to do, how truly simple it is, and therefore, to see whether we may not draw even a little closer together because of the simplicity of these ideas and, I think, the fact that we see all right-thinking [NORP] should be for, in general this kind of thing. [PERSON] once went to a great university. He was to receive an honorary degree of doctor of laws; and the dean of the law school, in presenting him to the president of the university, read a long citation. This citation had to deal largely, almost exclusively, with the long record of [PERSON] integrity, his absolute unimpeachable honesty as a public servant throughout his life. It dwelt on this theme in numerous ways and I think even quoted examples. Finally it was [PERSON] turn to speak. He said: My friends, I think I should decline to receive this decoration, because if the time has come when the [NORP] people and their great institutions of learning find it proper or necessary or desirable to decorate a man and give him awards because he is honest in the public service, then I despair of the [ORG]. This, he said, is something you can demand of your public servants; you do not .have to reward them for it. You can demand it through the proper use of your authority as an [NORP] citizen, through the ballot box, and you can see that you get good men--honest men and women in government. ' ' Now there is a particular reason why this is so important. We are very apt, when we speak about government in [GPE], to think of some rather amorphous, distant, bewildering, comprehensive, complex thing. We do not really know what we mean when we say government. We realize there is a President up there, and a few leaders in the [ORG] and the [ORG], and we sort of have them visualized; and the rest of it is just a bunch of bureaucrats. And that is largely true. But what I want to get over is this: government is nothing in the world but men and women that you select and send to fill the several offices. Now of course, there is an organization roughly outlined by a Constitution, and more crystallized through our laws as [DATE] have gone on. But the only thing that comprises government is men and women. Now those men and women, therefore, must be the people that you carefully select. Frankly, that is all that the administration that you people have sent to [GPE] is trying to do. Make certain they are men and women who, first, are unimpeachable in their approach to every public problem; that neither politics nor cronyism, nor hope of reward nor hope of favoring any particular class or group, has any influence on it; that they are motivated and inspired by one thing: what is the good of [CARDINAL] people? That must be, of course, the purpose in their hearts, but take a look at their heads. You have to send people who are, by their reputations in their own localities, fitted to tackle such complex jobs as now plague a government. They have to be men that have established some success. And you have got to work out in your own mind, What kind of man do I believe is a good Senator, a good Congressman, a good Governor? Incidentally, may I pause to say, you have so many good ones in [GPE], you seem to know more about this, maybe, than I do. But one thing I want to point out is this: we must not have doctrinaires. This world moves. We outlined, through our forefathers, a great set of principles in the Constitution, and that Constitution--through our [ORG], through actions of the [ORG] and the Chief Executive down through [DATE]--has been molded and modeled to our needs. Our needs are not what they were [DATE]. It is just as senseless, [DATE], to talk about the social security of [DATE] in the same terms we would have talked about social security when there were free lands everywhere, and this country was a debtor country with great assets and resources yet to be explored, as it is to talk about taking off here and flying to the moon, instead of waiting for [DATE] that it is going to take for the scientists to show how to do it. It is just that silly, to talk about going back to that kind of thing. Now, how do we get a man that is that flexible, that adjustable? We want men that can take and listen to facts, who are not so doctrinaire that every fact that is brought in front of them, if it does not agree with their preconceptions, it is just thrown out in the woodpile. That is a very necessary thing. And I want to assure you that in [DATE] I have watched some very great people making up the executive department--I have watched them work. I do not know of a single one who comes in with the theory--into the [ORG] meeting, or anywhere else--and with this theory fixed in the back of his mind forces everything to conform to it. On the contrary, every one of them is supported by his own selected group of associates, of advisers throughout this country--from trade associations, from every kind of professional group, from businessmen--everywhere. Those people are the ones that come in and help formulate the policies that this group then tries to translate into recommendations for the legislature to consider. What I am trying to show is this: that throughout the [CARDINAL] governmental departments, through the heads of agencies, of the [ORG], and [ORG], and everything else, there is a very earnest attempt on the part of these people to get the opinion of [GPE]. There is a very great conviction there that the commonsense of [GPE]--if we avoid both extremes, and take the commonsense judgment of [GPE], you have got a pretty good guide as to where we should move in legislation and in programs. I commend, therefore, the kind of man whom you know to be absolutely unimpeachable in his honesty, who has shown by his standing in the community that he deserves the respect of that community, and who has been something of a success, either as a young man or at any stage of life. And finally, a man who has got the flexibility of brain, in this day and time, to try to adjust the basic principles in which we believe, the liberty of the individual and his rights, and adjust to the problems that face us [DATE], whether it be in [GPE], [GPE], or whether it be right here in your great city of [GPE]. That is the kind of people that we need so desperately in [GPE]. And I think that you people who helped to send this administration there, if you will look at the character and types of people now occupying the executive positions, all the way from the Secretary of [ORG] on down to the newest appointee, that you can take some pride in the people that have been selected. And largely, after the [ORG] is selected, remember, all these other people are selected by those [ORG] officers. So there is a wide geographical distribution among these people. There is a wide distribution of professional attainment in their particular specialties. This same applies, of course, in the [ORG], by their very nature being so representative. Our leaders--particularly Senator [PERSON] and his senior associates in the [ORG], [PERSON] and the great [PERSON], a very great lieutenant, their associates in the [ORG]--are really doing a remarkable job. So, as we face this coming election, recognizing as we do that if you are going ahead with a positive program--and I am not going to take up your time [TIME] to outline this program again; it has been recited time and again in the newspapers, it has been on the television. As a matter of fact, some of you may know I made a little speech about it [TIME]. Now, of course, none of us is in detail going to agree entirely with that program, because no program, if it is made up as I have been trying to describe to you, is reflective of any single person's complete ideas. But if it follows the general purpose, the good of [CARDINAL] people, if it is supported by honest men and women who want nothing in the world but the good of those people, and if it has been intelligently, broadly based, then I think we have got something that we ought to be able to sell. [CARDINAL] of the troubles, of course, is that anyone who takes something of that kind to carry to the people is robbed, really, of the drama of the extremes. It is much easier, you know, to get up and say everybody is a so-and-so except my little gang and me, than it is to go out and sell a really constructive truth, because we tend to take it for granted. Well, I think that the [ORG], probably, is not capable of telling anybody how to dramatize these truths, these programs, and carry them out so that people will overwhelmingly accept them. But I know it can be done. I believe that if you carry the truth to the people, that there will be [CARDINAL] decision from the mass of [CARDINAL] [NORP]. I am going to end this little talk with a little story. Not long ago, I went out to [GPE] to [ORG], and on the way I happened to pick up a paper that was on my airplane. And [PERSON] had had a little trouble there at [ORG]--you remember he had asked his union to take a lower wage, a wage they agreed was in conformity with the average. [ORG] had been well above it, I understood, so he asked them to go to [MONEY]-and-something an hour. He got his teeth kicked in, the first time he proposed it, although the president of the union was very much on his side--I believe his name was [PERSON]. This story was after they had voted the second time and the union had overwhelmingly voted to accept this cut and then go to work. This union leader was interviewed by the press, and they said to him, Well, what do you think about all this? He said, Well, you know, I have found this: if you can just get time to tell your people the whole truth, they will always go along with the right thing. It was a rather comforting thought to have this labor leader saying this, when we had so many wise-cracking so called intellectuals going around and showing how wrong was everybody who did not happen to agree with them. By the way, I heard a definition of an intellectual that I thought was very interesting: a man who takes more words than are necessary to tell more than he knows. I hope that no one is going to get up and wisecrack at me and say, You have already done it. I think, though, with those thoughts, and I do pray there is a little bit of commonsense and homely philosophy in them, that you will accept, now, my thanks for the cordiality of your welcome, for the great honor you have done me by inviting me to appear before you. I assure you that within [TIME] or [TIME], I am to appear before another audience who are not going to be nearly as friendly. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitypetersonairforcebasecoloradosprings", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you very much. It is wonderful to see all of you, all of the service personnel, all of your families, all the kids who are here. I thank you for coming. And I just want you to know I kept the rain away. They thanked me at [ORG], and I said, You know, when you are President, you get blamed for so many things you did not do; it is okay to take credit for a thing or [CARDINAL] you did not do, either. But I am very, very glad to be here, glad to see all of you. I want to thank Chief Master Sergeant [PERSON] for her introduction. If she were running for office, she'd get a lot of votes just on being brief, I think. And I thank her for what she said. I am glad to be here with your Governor, [PERSON], General [PERSON], and others. [DATE] I want to say something serious, if I might, for a moment our Nation lost [CARDINAL] patriotic reservists of [ORG] based here at [FAC]. [DATE], I, as their President, just want to remember them with my respects, my gratitude, my thanks. And I'd like to ask if we could all just have a brief moment of silence in their memory, please. Thank you very much. Like the Rockies, the men and women here of [FAC] stand tall and strong and proud. You are always ready. You are the sentinels of our air sovereignty. You are the home base for [ORG] and for [ORG]. You are our eyes in space. I did a couple of interviews [DATE] with some [GPE] newspapers, and [CARDINAL] of them asked me if we still needed eyes in space since the cold war was over. And I said, the last time I checked we had more stuff up in space [DATE]; I thought we needed more eyes, not fewer. I thank you for what you are doing. You have made [GPE] safer. You have made the world safer. And as we face the new challenges of [DATE], you know as well as I do that the [NORP] military will continue to play a vital role, not only in the defense of our freedom and our security but also in advancing the cause of democracy and freedom throughout the world. We have seen painfully in [GPE] in [DATE], first at [FAC] and then at the awful incident at [GPE], that our security can be threatened in a global economy with open borders and lots of personal freedom here at home as well as beyond our borders. We had those [CARDINAL] terrorist incidents: [CARDINAL] of them occurred from people I believe were deeply disturbed and way off track within our country; another occurred because this is a free country and people can come and go here, and people who bore us ill will and wanted to destroy a symbol of [NORP] democracy came into this country and set that bomb at [FAC]. I am also happy to tell you that other sentinels of freedom working to thwart terrorism stopped [CARDINAL] terrible incidents that were planned, one to blow up another bomb in [GPE] and another that was designed to take some aircraft out of the air, flying out of the West Coast going over the Pacific. But we now know that the security threats we will face in the future, rooted in terrorism and organized crime and drug trafficking, are closely tied to things the military has had to work on for [DATE], trying to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stand up to rogue states, and protect our security interests around the world. We are going to have to fight on all these fronts, and you are going to have to continue to be the best trained, best equipped, best motivated, most flexible military in the world for us to succeed. I am committed to making sure that you always are that and to doing whatever we have to do to improve the quality of life and the conditions of living, so that the best people in [GPE] want to be in the military and want to stay in the military. Since I have been President, I have twice had to go back to [ORG] to ask for large appropriations totaling [MONEY] to help to maintain our training, our readiness, and our quality of life. And [DATE] I asked the [ORG] for a supplemental appropriation to cover contingencies in [ORG] so we could fund a pay increase at the maximum legal level allowable and continue to make improvements in readiness and the quality of life. We are going to continue to do that. If you are committed to serving [GPE], the people who make the decisions about investments in your future should be committed to making sure that you can serve and succeed, that you can have good families and a good life in the [GPE] military. And we are very grateful to you for that. Let me say, what I most wanted to do was to have a chance to say thank you personally and to go down the row and shake hands with the children. And while I am very good at stopping the rain, I am not good at keeping it away forever. So I am going to terminate my remarks with a heartfelt thank-you to all of you for your service to [GPE].

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia", "text": "Thank you so much. Thank you, Chief [PERSON], Sheriff [PERSON], District Attorney [PERSON]. Chief [PERSON], thank you very much for the tour of your activities [TIME] and your statements. Thank you, Congressman [PERSON]. Thank you, Madam Attorney General, for all the great work you do. I'd like to also say a word of appreciation for some others who are here who have not spoken [DATE]: our [GPE] Attorney, [PERSON]; the [ORG] Commissioner, [PERSON]; the person who was very active in helping me pass the crime bill which put these police officers on our streets, former Congresswoman [PERSON], I am delighted to see you here. I want to thank all the officers who are here from the [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], from [GPE], from [GPE]. I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Thank you all very much. Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to [GPE] and to [GPE] [DATE] and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress. Mostly what people talked to me about then were [CARDINAL] problems, the economy and the problem of crime and illegal immigration. I spent a lot of time here [DATE] and had the opportunity to come back often since. If you will forgive me just one personal note, this is the first time I have come back to [GPE] since the death of my friend [PERSON], who served this country so well as our Ambassador to [GPE], and I miss him now, coming back here, and I want to thank him for what he did for me here. Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do. On the economy, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Because we are building [CARDINAL] new ships for our national defense, the [GPE] shipyards are busy, securing another [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] 000 jobs until [DATE]. I think that is a good and positive step. Because in [DATE] and [DATE] the [ORG] agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area. Because we have started work on a new sewage treatment plant and we are proposing to step up our sand reclamation efforts, thanks in no small measure to the relentless efforts of Congressman [PERSON], we are ensuring that the [GPE] beaches will be enjoyed by children and their children for generations to come. But we all know that [GPE] has had, building over [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE], a serious problem of illegal immigration which has aggravated the crime problem along our borders. The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we have made. She gave me a report [DATE] which reviews where we are and what we have done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over [GPE], we have made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. Immigration laws are national laws, not State laws. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by [ORG]. I have done what I could to get more money into [GPE] in very difficult fiscal circumstances in [GPE] to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration-more than ever before- and I will continue to work on that. But the most important thing is we have to be able to work together to prove that we can do better. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there is a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both [GPE] and our friends in [GPE] are working together in a long-term and consistent way. But think about how far we have come in [DATE]. [DATE], many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in [GPE] would return [DATE] to commit crimes again. For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but did not do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It is a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it is worked pretty well here. Our message has been simple: We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe. Well, you heard what the prosecutor said: [GPE] has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the [CARDINAL] biggest urban areas. I actually believe when the numbers come out [DATE], you will be even lower than that. And it is a great tribute to the work that you have done together. Let me say, again, while the job is far from over-and we have a lot of work to do-the report I got from [ORG] makes clear that we have begun to turn border communities under siege into communities where law and order and safety and security are once again the order of the day. I want to say too, again, I am glad that we are working to put [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] police officers on the streets of [GPE], that we are putting community policing in every community in the country that is willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it. [DATE] I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the [GPE] citizens patrol in the [ORG] program. They are also helping your communities to be safer. The RSVP program is helping your community to be safer. So I ask you, do not stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you are surprised when you hear about a crime, then you will know you have got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it. The second thing we are doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they do not belong here in the first place, they are being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of [DATE], we have arrested [CARDINAL] criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to [GPE] after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem. We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We have added [ORG] agents, in [GPE] alone increasing by [CARDINAL] the number of agents who are working for you by [DATE]. In [GPE], our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. [Laughter] Here in [GPE], control has been taken back of [GPE] from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built [CARDINAL] of new fences, installed [QUANTITY] of new lighting. There is more to do. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing [GPE] residents in East County, particularly with the onset of [DATE]. [DATE] I have asked the Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], to send [CARDINAL] more law enforcement officers to [FAC], and they will be there by the close of business [DATE]. Let me say [CARDINAL] final word of appreciation here to the cooperation between the [ORG], [ORG], and local law enforcement officials. What they have done here [DATE], over [DATE]-I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in [GPE]. It is a shame that it is rare, but it is rare, and we can be grateful that here there is [CARDINAL] [NORP] law enforcement team. And I tell you, that is what we are trying to create for all the citizens of [GPE], wherever they live. And I am very proud of what they have done. They have put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That is why there has been an [PERCENT] increase in felony drug prosecutions in [DATE]. That is why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they are all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, [PERSON] bless them, we need more like them all over this country. Let me just say [CARDINAL] other thing that affects [NORP] a long way from you, but I bet you have all identified with them in [DATE]. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for [NORP], we all came from somewhere else. I say that to make this point: Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in [GPE], and that ought to be the rule here. And because we are people and because we are imperfect, the country will always have problems. There will never be a time when there will be no problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us. I say that because even though I am a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for [DATE] as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That is just another way of people finding a way-trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow [NORP], just as we are before God Almighty. And to burn a church is a terrible thing. [DATE], I reported to the [NORP] people about what we were doing to deal with the church bombings. And then [DATE] yet another congregation, this one in [GPE], [GPE], found its church in flames. We have got to stop these things. We do have a team of [ORG], [ORG], and local law enforcement officials working overtime to investigate these crimes. [TIME], [ORG] investigators made an arrest for the burning of the church in [GPE], [GPE], [DATE]. And I do want you to know that for all the partisan fights you hear about in [GPE], there is a bipartisan bill before the [ORG], sponsored by a [NORP] from [GPE], [PERSON], and a [NORP] from [GPE], [PERSON], to make it easier to prosecute anyone who attacks any house of worship, of any religious faith, of any race in [GPE], and I urge [ORG] to pass it without delay. We need to come together as one [GPE] to rebuild our churches, restore hope, and show the forces of hatred they cannot win, just as we need to come together as one [GPE] to say we are a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws. If you want to be in our country, you should be here lawfully. We will protect our people. We will enforce our laws. We will secure our future. And we will do it together.

And of course, to [PERSON] and [PERSON], who show no lack of energy in pressing your cause with the President. When [PERSON] mentioned there are now [CARDINAL] members of this caucus in [ORG], I was sitting next to [PERSON], and I knew what she was thinking: That is [CARDINAL] too few. And I was thinking it, too, based on your record. I think the thing that has been overlooked in this whole endeavor of trying to give more sensitivity to issues of special concern to women and trying to give women more opportunities to serve is that we live in an age where every public figure says, as if it were just a cliche, that the most important resource in any human endeavor in the private sector or the public sector is our people. And yet we cavalierly go on, in example after example after example, not giving all our people the chance to live up to the fullest of their God-given capacities and make the greatest service they can to the rest of us to promote the general welfare. I have done what I could to correct that, partly based on the example of my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, and partly because I have known so many of you personally, and partly because it is manifest that we have to find a way to reach across all the lines in our society and lift up everyone to the position of his or her highest and best use and potential. In that connection, I would like to thank the newly confirmed Ambassador to the [FAC], [PERSON], for her willingness to serve. I have been proud to work with you on a lot of issues. Most of them have been mentioned tonightthe family and medical leave law, which has changed more lives than almost any bill that we have passed around here in a long time. Everywhere I go around the country now, people still come up to me and tell me personal stories of how that law changed their lives. The [PERSON]-Kennedy bill, the minimum wage, the child care, the adoption tax credit, increased child support enforcement, the family violence initiativesall these things have made a difference. The hand of this caucus was felt heavily in the recent balanced budget, with the single biggest aid to education increase since [DATE], the biggest increase in aid to children's health since [ORG] in [DATE], and the children's tax credit. So, the country is in your debt. And I do believe that the bipartisan nature of this caucus has made a profound difference. I know that we are joined [TIME] by the [NORP] leader, [PERSON], and I believe Speaker [PERSON] wanted to be here and had to be in [GPE] [TIME]. I know Mr. [PERSON] would agree with me that all of us have been impressed by how you are able to stay together, work together, and, in [PERSON]'s terms, get down to business no matter how crazy things get in this occasionally loony town. And for that, too, we are all in your debt, for you set an example that everyone else should follow. I'd like to talk [TIME] about health issues. [PERSON] mentioned them and has worked on them so hard, and others have mentioned them. The budget not only provided for [MONEY] to extend health coverage to [CARDINAL] children who do not have it, thus giving greater peace of mind to the parents who are raising them, both as parents and also when they are away at work, it did a lot more for the health of women. It expanded [ORG] to cover bone mass measurement for women at risk of osteoporosis. Funding for osteoporosis research has now reached [MONEY] at [ORG]. It expanded [ORG] to cover [DATE] mammograms for all women over [DATE] and eliminated the copayments to make these examinations more affordable. These were important things, and we have more to do. We have to continue our focus on women's health. Since I took office, funding for breast cancer research, prevention, and treatment has almost doubled, and we have discovered [CARDINAL] breast cancer genes, holding great promise for the development of new prevention strategies, something that is profoundly important to all of us who have ever dealt with this in our families. We are unlocking the mysteries of the genetic code and continuing to discover new ways to diagnose and treat genetic disorders. But we know that these breakthroughs also bring with them the need for new protections. Studies show the leading reason women do not take advantage of new genetic breast cancer tests is because they fear they will be discriminated in health plans if the tests come out the wrong way. This is wrong, and it ought to be illegal. So I want to work with you to get [ORG] to pass bipartisan legislation that will ban all health plans, group and individual, from denying coverage or raising premiums on the basis of genetic tests. After all, if we can get everybody to take the tests, if they know what they are up against, in the end we will prevent more severe illness, we will reduce cost to the health care system. And we should not punish individuals for doing something that we know is not only in their own interest but is in the interest of society. Also, legislation should prohibit all health plans from disclosing genetic information that could be misused by other insurers. It ought to protect researchers' ability to make the best use of this important tool. So, again, let me applaud those, especially Representative [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON], for their leadership. Genetic discrimination legislation deserves action now. Let me also say that many of you in this room have contributed to our efforts to support legislation to protect women who have had mastectomies. They should not be forced out of the hospital before they are ready because of pressure from a health plan. It is unacceptable that [ORG] has not yet held a hearing on the DeLauro-Dingell-Roukema [TIME] mastectomy patient protection bill, and we need to keep pushing for that. And finally, we need to keep breaking down the doors and breaking through the glass ceilings and acting to bring women the full measure of economic and legal equity to which they are entitled. This caucus and our administration, under the leadership of [PERSON], continues to work to counter the effects of discrimination and long-developed networks which hinder the success of women- and minority-owned businesses. I am proud of the fact that the [ORG] in [DATE] has tripled the number of loans to women businesses, and I thank you for your support of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, which has successfully increased the percentage of women- and minority-owned construction firms. I am pleased to say that this has now passed both [ORG], and I hope you will keep up the fight so that it actually reaches my desk. [DATE] after its creation, [ORG] commands the respect that you have always deserved. You now have a record you can be proud of. You work in a way that you can be proud of. You can feel the respect here in this audience [TIME] of all the people who have come to pay tribute. [TIME] is a night for celebration. We celebrate an initiative taken in [DATE], a celebration of [DATE] of hard work, of the many initiatives that you have accomplished. But most importantly, I am here to celebrate the energy, the intelligence, the character, and the old-fashioned patriotic devotion to the task at hand that will bring you even more brilliant achievements in [DATE]. Thank you, and God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthedigitaldivideandexchangewithreporters", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Good [TIME]. I just thought we ought to come out here in the brisk [TIME] sunshine and wake up together. I want to thank the representatives here from all parts of the communications industry, from the foundation world, from various civil rights and other civic groups for being here, and coming in and giving me a chance to make this statement, because I had intended to go to Secretary [PERSON]'s conference [DATE] on bridging the digital divide, and because I am going to [GPE], I could not do that. So they came in [TIME], and we had a visit. I want to thank them for being here and for their commitment and for all those who are not here but who are at the conference. This conference is about closing the digital divide. And we have worked hard on that for [DATE] in very specific contexts. Under the Vice President's leadership, we have worked to make sure that eventually a digital divide will not deprive business of the technology-savvy workers they need and will not hurt our educational systems [DATE]. We started with the first [ORG] in [GPE], back in [DATE], when only 3 percent of our classrooms were wired and [PERCENT] of our schools were. And we have been working ever since. Now we know that, through the public-private partnerships that have been established all over [GPE], through the Telecommunications Act and the E-rate, which the [ORG] set to make sure our poorest schools could afford to be connected, we are now up [PERCENT] of the schools, from [PERCENT], and [PERCENT] of the classrooms, from [PERCENT], since [DATE]. And I think that is pretty good. I am very pleased by that, and we are on our way to meeting our goal sometime [DATE] of having all of our schools wired and, soon after that, all of our classrooms wired. I want to thank the Vice President and all the people in various industries who have supported us and helped us in this regard. But as Secretary [PERSON]'s most recent Falling Through the Net report shows, there is still a lot more to do. We must connect all of our citizens to the Internet not just in schools and libraries but in homes, small businesses, and community centers. And we must help all [NORP] gain the skills they need to make the most of the connection. So [TIME], as they go back to their meeting, I want to announce a series of new plans and partnerships that will expand on both these efforts to use the combined forces of public, private, and nonprofit sectors, finally to slam shut the digital divide. First, I have decided to lead a prominent delegation, including top CEO's, on a new markets tour [DATE] to focus specifically on the digital divide out in [GPE]. As we have done on our previous tours, we will visit communities that have not fully participated in our Nation's economic growth. And yet, in the communities we will also see how partnerships between the public and private sectors can unleash the power of the Internet to link children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to enhance safety, and foster economic development. Second, I am signing an executive memorandum to ensure that closing the digital divide will be a vital goal not just for Secretary [PERSON] and for us here in [ORG] but throughout [ORG]. For example, I am directing Secretary [PERSON] to work with the private sector to develop a national strategy for connecting all [NORP] to the Internet and directing Secretaries [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON] to expand our growing network of community technology centers. I just ask you all to think about this [CARDINAL] thing. What do you believe the economic impact would be if Internet access and usage were as dense in [GPE] as telephone access and usage? I think it is clear that we need to keep working until we achieve this goal. Third, with the help of many other groups, [ORG] is launching an initiative to empower the entire civil rights community through an expanding civilrights.org website, through leadership forums and even [DATE] freedom riders who will bring high-tech training to the doorsteps of nonprofit organizations. As [ORG] has said, the digital divide is a key civil rights issue of [DATE]. That is why our civil rights organizations must be ready, wired, and able to lead the change. Fourth, [ORG] is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software, and Internet industries, as well as [ORG] and several other large private foundations, to create [ORG], an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities. For the first time, we will have [CARDINAL]-stop shop for tracking our progress in every community and for learning exactly what is worked and what has not . Now, these are the steps we will take immediately. I want to thank all the leaders who are here [DATE] who are making these initiatives possible and all of those who are going to announce specific things that they and their companies and organizations are doing at the conference. I thank them for the other major commitments they will make, because there is no single, big silver bullet here, but we know we have to have a national commitment to closing the digital divide. I also want to send out an invitation to all of your counterparts around the country who are not able to be with us [DATE] but who should join with us in this great national endeavor. Together we have the power to determine exactly what we want the Internet to become. And what we want it to do is to be an instrument of empowerment, education, enlightenment, and economic advance and community building all across [GPE], regardless of the race, the income, the geography of our citizens. And thanks to these people, we are going to be closer to achieving that goal. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheemergencyplanforaidsrelief", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you all for coming. I am honored you all are here. I am so grateful that many from the diplomatic corps are here. This is [DATE] for [GPE]. It is [DATE] of great consequence. It is [DATE] in which we have an opportunity to work with others to shape the future of our globe. We have a chance to achieve peace. We have a chance to achieve a more compassionate world for every citizen. [GPE] believes deeply that everybody has worth, everybody matters, everybody was created by the Almighty, and we are going to act on that belief, and we will act on that passion. You know, the world looks at us and say, They are strong. And we are. We are strong militarily, but we have got a greater strength than that. We have got a strength in the universality of human rights and the human condition. It is in our country's history. It is ingrained in our soul. And [DATE] we are going to describe how we are going to act, not just talk, but act, on the basis of our firm beliefs. I want to thank [PERSON]; he is the new chairman of the board of [ORG]. He is also the Secretary of [ORG], doing a great job for our administration. I want to thank so very much the Ambassadors from [GPE] and [GPE] for standing up here with us [DATE]. I appreciate the other ambassadors from the continent of Africa and the Caribbean for being here. With us as well is [PERSON], a [GPE] Senator, majority leader, passionate advocate of good health care for every citizen on the globe, a man with whom this administration will work, along with [PERSON], from [GPE], to make sure that the proposal becomes real. That means funded. There is no doubt in my mind that when you have got the majority leader and a distinguished Senator like Senator [PERSON] teaming up together, that this will get done. It is just a matter of time. I am honored that [PERSON] is here [PERSON] is here, who is the [ORG] administrator of [ORG]. I want to thank the [GPE] Surgeon General [PERSON] is here with us. [PERSON], thank you for coming. [PERSON] is [ORG] administrator. Dr. [PERSON] of the [ORG] is with us. [PERSON] is here with us. There are a lot of docs here [DATE]. [PERSON] of [ORG]. Thank you all for coming [DATE]. [PERSON] is the deputy commissioner of [ORG]. And of course, a man who is on my staff who is going to make an enormous difference here and abroad as a direct adviser to the President, and that is Dr. [PERSON], who is the director of [ORG]. He is about as fine a human being as you will ever know. He cares deeply, and his care has had he is got a lot of influence, let me put it to you this way, because of his convictions. As I mentioned, we are a strong nation, but we are also a blessed nation, and it is important for our citizens to recognize it. Richness is [CARDINAL] thing; recognizing that we are blessed gives a different perspective, I think. I think it enhances the fact that we have a responsibility. If you are blessed, there is a responsibility to recognize your blessings in a compassionate way. Blessings are a [CARDINAL]-way street. We have got to understand in this country that if you value life and say every life is equal, that includes a suffering child on the continent of Africa. If you are worried about freedom, that is just not freedom for your neighbor in [GPE]; that is freedom for people around the globe. It is a universal principle. As I said in my State of the Union, freedom is not [GPE]'s gift to the world; freedom is God's gift to humanity. Freedom means freedom from a lot of things. And [DATE], on the continent of Africa, freedom means freedom from the fear of a deadly pandemic. That is what we think in [GPE], and we are going to act on that belief. Our founding belief in human dignity should be how we conduct ourselves around the world and will be how we conduct ourselves around the world. I want you all to remember, and our fellow citizens to remember, that this is nothing new for our country. Human dignity has been a part of our history for a long time. We fed the hungry after World War I. This country carried out the [PERSON] plan and the [GPE] airlift. [DATE] we provide [PERCENT] of all the international food aid. We are acting on our compassion. It is nothing new for our country. But there is a pandemic which we must address now, before it is too late. And that is why I took this message to our fellow citizens, that now is the time for this country to step up our efforts to save lives. After all, on the continent of Africa, [CARDINAL] people have the AIDS virus [CARDINAL] people. [CARDINAL] children under [DATE] have the AIDS virus. [CARDINAL] people require immediate drug treatment. Yet, [PERCENT] of people receive drug treatment. I mean, there is a significant world problem that [GPE] can do something about. We can be involved. [PERSON] mentioned the images, the horrible images, that take place in Africa. It is important for our fellow citizens, as they listen to the dialog on this initiative, to understand that there are mass burials and unmarked graves on the continent of Africa. So many people are dying that the graves are unmarked. The pandemic is creating such havoc that there are mass burials, that there are wards of children that are dying because of AIDS, not a ward, not some wards, but wards after wards full of dying children because of AIDS, that there are [CARDINAL] of orphans, lonely children, because their mom or dad has died children left, in some cases, to fend for themselves. Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many folks do not seek treatment, and that is a reality. It is as if the AIDS pandemic just continues to feed upon itself over and over and over again, because of hopelessness. This country needs to provide some hope, because this disease can be prevented and it can be treated. That is important for our fellow citizens to know. Anti-retroviral drugs are now dramatically more affordable in many nations, and these drugs are used to extend the lives of those with HIV. In other words, these drugs are really affordable. And when the treatment has come to Africa, it is also important for our citizens to understand the effect of that treatment. It is called the [PERSON] effect. When [CARDINAL] patient is rescued by medicine, as if back from the dead, many others with AIDS seek testing and treatment, because it is the first sign of hope they have ever seen. We have the opportunity to bring that hope to [CARDINAL]. It is an opportunity for this Nation to affect [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of lives. And so that is why I have laid out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I called it in my State of the Union a work of mercy, and that is what I believe it is. With approval of [ORG], we will devote [MONEY] to the fight AIDS abroad over [DATE], beginning with [CARDINAL] in [DATE]. I have been asked whether or not we are committed to [ORG]. Well, first of all, I would not put [PERSON] as the head of it if we were not . And more importantly, he would not have joined if we were not . And so we are still committed to [ORG] to fight disease. This program in no way diminishes our commitment to the fund. We will continue bilateral AIDS programs in [CARDINAL] countries. We have already got bilateral relations with [CARDINAL] countries with whom we are working on AIDS, and we will continue that program. But this plan that I have laid out in front of the [ORG], and will work with Members of the [ORG] and the [ORG] on, will dramatically focus our efforts. You notice I did not say, focus our efforts, I said, dramatically focus our efforts. And that is important for the [NORP] people to understand, because we want to bring a comprehensive system. It is more than money that we bring; we bring expertise and compassion and love and the desire to develop a comprehensive system, work with people in Africa to do so, for diagnosis and treatment and prevention. We are determined to turn the tide against AIDS. And we are going to start in [CARDINAL] [NORP] and [NORP] countries, where the disease is most heavily concentrated. We whip it in those [CARDINAL] or 14 we will show what is possible in other countries. We are going to be involved with the fund. We will continue to have bilateral aid. We want to have intense focus where the need is most severe and show the world what is possible not just show our fellow citizens or show the folks on the continent of Africa, but the world needs to see what we can do together. The model has been applied with great success in [GPE]. Anybody who knows the issue of AIDS on the African Continent appreciates the efforts of [GPE]. And we feel like that it can be duplicated, and that is the mission, the goal. Even though we are on [CARDINAL] countries initially with this major focus, we understand there is suffering elsewhere. And we want to expand beyond. We want to encourage others to join us as well. The funding will initially go toward expanding existing hospitals and, of course, drawing on the knowledge and the expertise of local physicians. That makes sense. You have got a doc in place, we want to encourage that doc to be able to continue his or her healing. We will build satellite facilities that can serve more people. Of course, we will provide antiretroviral drugs and as well work with folks on the ground for education and care. It is important for our citizens to know that the infrastructure is it is hard for many [NORP] to imagine the lack of infrastructure that we are working with on the continent of Africa. So we use motorcycles, trucks, bicycles. We use nurses and local healers to go to the farthest villages and farms to test for the disease and to deliver medications that will save lives. It does not matter how the medications get there; what matters is they do get there. Facilities across Africa and the Caribbean will have now the medicine. And our fellow citizens must understand that the reason they do is because of your generosity, the taxpayers of the country. I hope when our citizens absorb that knowledge the massive attempt to save lives that they feel proud of their country and proud of the compassion of [GPE]. We are going to work with other governments, of course, private groups there is all kinds of faith-based programs involved on the continent of Africa, and we welcome that, of course. And we encourage that. And we thank you for that. A fellow named Father [PERSON] is here. Where are you, Father? Right there, yes. I thought you were Father [PERSON] for [TIME]. He is in [GPE], works in [GPE]. He is obviously followed his faith. He leads an organization that provides testing and treatment in [GPE]. He is helped [CARDINAL] of people [DATE]. He ought to be giving this speech, not me, because he knows what it must feel like to play a significant role in saving lives. And that is what we are here to talk about [DATE], how best to save lives. And here is what the experts believe that will be accomplished through the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief: that in [DATE], we will prevent [CARDINAL] new infections; that we will treat [CARDINAL] people with life-extending drugs. We will provide humane care, of course, for those who suffer and, as importantly, for the orphans. To me, that is just the beginning. But it is a pretty good start. Most important thing is we are providing hope, which is immeasurable. How can you possibly measure the benefits of hope? There is no we cannot quantify that. But it certainly can be qualified by saying a hopeful society is a heck of a lot better society than what they found on the continent [DATE]. This project is urgent, and as we move forward on this program we will continue to call upon other nations to join. [GPE] does not mind leading, and we believe others have a responsibility as well, that we are not the only blessed nation. There are many blessed nations. And we hope they join us. And as well we have got a lot of work to do here in [GPE]. It is important for our fellow citizens never to think that [CARDINAL] initiative or a major initiative in Africa does not mean we are going to forget the [CARDINAL] 000 people living in [GPE] [DATE] who carry the HIV virus. Of course we will never do that. It is important for our citizens to understand that there is [CARDINAL] new infections [DATE] in this country. It is an issue. It is an issue we must continue to deal with. The AIDS diagnosis still obviously brings tremendous grief and worries in parts of our society. And so the budget I have submitted and worked with [ORG] on will be a request for [MONEY] for domestic HIV prevention and care and treatment; it is a [PERCENT] increase over [DATE]. It is a [MONEY] increase for AIDS research. It is [MONEY] more to support [ORG]. This is a program which provides funding to purchase AIDS-related medicines for those without health coverage. And we are going to help those abroad, and we will help those at home as well. We must also move quickly to increase the number of people who are tested for HIV. How can you treat if you do not test? How can you help if you do not know? And so [ORG] recently has approved a new HIV test, which can provide results in [TIME], with a [PERCENT] accuracy. So [DATE] I have got an announcement to make, and it is this: That [ORG], after a lot of careful review, has waived regulations so that the test will soon be more readily available to doctors and public health facilities throughout the country. As I have said, it is going to be [DATE] for our country. I am a person who believes that there is no obstacle put in our path that we cannot overcome; I truly believe that. I love what our country stands for. I love the strength of [GPE]. The strength of [GPE] really is the lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens. As we move forward into [DATE], there is no doubt we can help the people on the African Continent, while we help our own folks at home with the deadly disease. There is no doubt we can arrest the pandemic. There is no doubt we can bring hope in all parts of the world, not only in Africa but in neighborhoods in our own country where people wonder what the [NORP] Dream means. There is no doubt in my mind we can make the world more peaceful. [DATE]'s initiative is one it is a step toward showing the world the great compassion of a great country. Thanks for coming, and God bless.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthegraduationceremonytheschoolforcapitolpageboys", "text": "Ladies and gentlemen: [PERSON] once said that [ORG] requires the constitution of an athlete, the patience of a mother, and the endurance of an early [NORP]. Personally, I think he may have overstated the requirements of the Presidency. But from very long and close observation of [DATE], it seems to me that President [PERSON] may have been describing the requirements for congressional page. So, whether your experience on the [ORG] has been long or brief, each of you in this page class [TIME] has been through a very rigorous and a very demanding test. And I want you to know--each of you to know--that I am extremely proud of you. From this point on you will turn upward along many different paths. All of you are exceptional young men with exceptional training. I am sure that in your choices of professions or other pursuits many of you will achieve exceptional success. Whatever your pursuit, however, I hope that the experience you have had at the heart of our representative democratic system will always be a part of your life. Even if you do not choose a career of public service, I hope as private citizens you will live your lives with a high and an active sense of public duty and responsibility. This is a time of change in [GPE]. All of us are awakening to the fact that [GPE] [DATE] is far different from the land into which my generation or your generation was born. The answers, the attitudes, and the approaches of [DATE], or [DATE], or even [DATE], are not now adequate to meet the new obligations or the new opportunities of [DATE]. As one who shares with you a very abiding respect and affection for the [ORG], I am especially gratified and pleased by the response that [ORG] itself has made [DATE] and [DATE] toward meeting the change of our changing times. [ORG] has done much to silence the critics and the cynics who have belabored it and who have attempted to downgrade it. You can all be proud that you served during a season when the [ORG] of [GPE] was strengthened and revitalized as a functioning, responsive, and conscientiously responsible branch of our system of government. And I am pleased that at their own direction they are now engaging in a considerable amount of introspection and study on how they can make the [ORG] stronger and better and more effective. As this is a changing land, so [GPE] stands as a part of the changing world. There are some who would have mankind believe that the only choices of these times are choices between political philosophies. Actually, I do not believe that this is the case. In a real sense, the choice facing men in every nation [DATE], old or young, large and small, is a choice between moving into the modern world with all of its unlimited potential or turning back toward the restrictive world that is dominated by the dogma and the doctrine of [DATE]. So, in your lifetimes, and in the lifetimes of a majority of the nations on earth, the total of human knowledge has doubled twice. The growth of human knowledge has made obsolete many of the causes of friction and contention and division among nations. Certainly the advance of human knowledge has made war itself obsolete and impossible as a means of resolving differences between large or small nations. Above all, the growth of human knowledge has rendered obsolete and archaic the doctrine on which the dogma of communism was constructed. Man [DATE] has in his capacity the potential of ending human misery or ending human life. We can really, for the first time, see the promise and the prospect of eliminating hunger and poverty, illness, bias, and prejudice in our own land and, we would hope, all around the world. So, this is the work that we want to do. And this is the work which your generation will do. And that is why I have said over, and over, and over again that we of [GPE] invite all peoples--East and West--to pull back their curtains, and to tear down their walls, and to come out of the darkness of dogma and walk all together in the bright light of human knowledge and human freedom toward the peace that mankind must make together, and must keep together, on this earth. I have seen many classes of [ORG] pages graduate throughout [DATE]. I would say that the class of which you are members faces the brightest and the most thrilling and the most hopeful prospects of any. For never before have young men like yourselves had so sure and so strong a prospect of being a part of the constructive building of a sane and a sensible and a rational world. Whatever profession you choose as your own, I hope you will never forget that the ultimate success of our system rests upon the contributions that every citizen makes to public service. And I would hope that as [DATE] and [DATE] go by that you would, too, engage in a little introspection and ask yourselves, upon occasions at least: What did I do [DATE] to make my country better, to make it stronger, to make my Government more efficient and more useful? And whether as the elected or the elector you will have a great opportunity to be leaders of your times in fostering the responsible and the responsive politics that is needed at every level--local and [ORG], as well as national and international ? You have been privileged to know some of the great leaders of these times in the legislative halls. And I hope that when your time comes you will keep faith by being leaders then in the cause of peace and freedom for the world, and for progress for all of humankind. I went to sleep [TIME] after reading a letter from a mother who was the mother of [CARDINAL] child, and that boy was now [DATE]. And she had just gotten a letter from him and he said in [DATE] he would be on his way to [PERSON]. And she said, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I hesitate to take your time to write this letter, but I did not want to see my boy go away unless and until I could have your assurance that our Government and our country needs that boy and needs him where he is going. He had lost his father. He was an only child. It was a difficult letter to dictate an answer to, but I had to write it [TIME]. And I told her that our liberty and our freedom was so precious, and liberty and freedom was in danger. And we had to call upon those who were capable and equipped to help us protect it. And all of us in our own way were doing the very best we could to preserve freedom, and that I did think it was necessary. The mother had said in her letter that if t felt that, that she would not , under any circumstances, object, although she did have to admit that while she did not want him out of the service, and she did not want him not to face up to his duty, she had to admit that she did not look with any favor to his going to that place at this time. So, those of you who in a short time will be in the service of your country in [CARDINAL] capacity or another, know how blessed you are to live in a system that was inherited by you as the result of the sacrifice of many [CARDINAL] of young men like yourselves. I believe that as you leave your present work that you will have gained from the halls of the [ORG] a sense of duty and a sense of responsibility that will always make the job of serving your country a pleasant one for you. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthejohnfkennedymemorialparklewistonmaine", "text": "Congressman [PERSON], all the nice public servants on the platform with me, and all of you private officials in the audience: I want to thank each of you, as Mrs. [PERSON] did, for this wonderful welcome and for the privilege of coming back to [GPE] again. When Senator [PERSON] talked about the last speech he made in this park, he told me that that evening while he was waiting on Senator [PERSON] to come here that you people waited [TIME] in [CARDINAL] weather. And although I was not here, I am grateful and understanding of the loyalty and the appreciation you had for that great man whom I succeeded and for whom this park was named. We have tried to carry forward his program, put it on the statute books, and execute it as he would have had us do. [DATE] we have traveled throughout the northeastern part of [GPE] and New England and we have talked about the problems of our people. We talked about pollution in Lake Erie in [GPE] [DATE]. We talked about the problems of our cities where [PERCENT] of all of our people are going to be living in just a matter of a few years, in [GPE]. [TIME] we dedicated a [FAC] hospital and talked about medical care, and the treatment of our bodies, and what we are going to do to save lives, and how we got rid of polio, and how we are going to get rid of cancer, and how we are going to stop heart disease--one of the greatest killers in this country. [TIME] we talked to the young people over at [ORG] about their rights, about civil rights, about constitutional rights. But we also talked about the responsibilities that go with those rights and the understanding that goes with them. [TIME] we were at [GPE], and we talked about the thing that is on most of your minds--our men in [GPE], and how we can bring peace to the world and bring honor to ourselves. I am going to talk about another subject here in [GPE] [TIME], because I am so happy to be back in [GPE]. [DATE], Congressman [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], and a number of other public officials have been with me. They are [NORP] and they are [NORP]. But we have not been talking party matters. We have been talking people matters; problems of people. We do not want to just talk about problems all the time. We want to talk about our successes, too. And I am going to do that [TIME]. [DATE] I stood on the steps of the city hall in [GPE] and I quoted from a message that Governor [PERSON] once sent to the [GPE] legislature. Governor [PERSON] said: A government has something more to do than govern and levy taxes to pay the Governor .... Government must also encourage good, point out improvements, open roads of prosperity, and infuse life into all the right enterprises. I promised the citizens of [GPE] [TIME] that we would try to follow that course if we were selected for this place of leadership. And I have come back [TIME] to report that we have lived up to that promise. Your Government--and I think it is very important that each of you always remembers this is your Government, not my Government-this is your Government and it has been infusing life into [CARDINAL] right enterprise after another. And we have just only begun. And I think there is no better example of this than the promising new [GPE] project that we call the [ORG] hydroelectric project. We are going to put [MONEY] into this project, and every single one of those dollars will be a good, sound investment in the future of a stable [GPE] and in the future of all [GPE]. I have [CARDINAL] brilliant young men on my staff from [GPE]: [PERSON] of [GPE] and [PERSON], my Associate Press Secretary, from [GPE]. They are both good lawyers and good citizens. But we were talking [TIME] and [CARDINAL] of them said, You know, Mr. President, so many people have been listening so long to the old voices that constantly talk about big government, that they have not caught up with the fact [GPE] is a very big country. Our population increased by [CARDINAL] people alone [DATE]. [DATE] from now we will have [CARDINAL] [NORP]. So we cannot have a stagecoach government in the era of orbiting astronauts. Government has to keep up with the times, and it has to stay ahead of the problems. For too long we have lagged behind and now we are trying to catch up. I came here [TIME] to pledge to you good people--who are [NORP] first, but select the best government you know how--I came here to pledge you that as long as I lead this country we are going to keep up and catch up. But I came here to say something else. Building a Great Society is not the job of a President alone. It is not the responsibility of the leaders of the [ORG]--some of whom are here with us [TIME]--alone. It cannot be done in [GPE] alone. It has to be the goal of every man and woman, every boy and girl. Every one of you has to pitch in and improve the corner of the country that you live in. We can pass laws to bring justice to all our people, whatever their color. We can spend money for housing, education, and training. But until we have a domestic good-neighbor policy on every block, in every city, on every roadway, there is going to be racial strife in [GPE]. We can start new programs to try to clean up the ghettoes of our cities, but until the people who live in our suburbs are color blind, there will continue to be discrimination in [GPE]. We can establish training programs for young people who need a second chance, but until law-abiding citizens give them their second chance, there is going to be delinquency in [GPE]. So if I could write just [CARDINAL] letter to every [NORP] citizen [TIME], I would make it brief, but I would try to make it directly to the point. And I would say something like this: My fellow [NORP], democracy depends on whether you are willing to conduct yourself as if the destiny of many others were in your hands, as if the future and the character of our Nation were to be decided by what you are and by what you do. Live [DATE] with the knowledge that [GPE] is the sum total of all the decisions that you and people like you are making [TIME]. I would write that letter because I believe that what [GPE] needs more than it needs anything else right now is a strong dose of self-discipline. We need it to carry through and to support our men who are in the rice paddies of [GPE] [TIME]. We need it to bring racial peace and social justice to all our citizens in [GPE]. We need it to bring education to the mind and health to the bodies of all of our boys and girls in this country [TIME]. And we need it to maintain the strong economy that gives all of our people good jobs at good wages [TIME]. Because never forget that no matter how many harassing, frustrating problems you may have, the strong economy is the underpinning of [GPE]'s material strength. Let me illustrate what I mean. People are talking a lot about inflation [DATE]. These same people used to talk a lot about unidentified flying objects. Well, now, what is inflation? Where is it going? Where did it come from? I do not know the answers. But I do think that we should try to put the problem of inflation into perspective--and not just in terms of [DATE] when prices were very low but few people had many dollars to buy much with. I mean the perspective that comes from looking at both sides of the prosperity coin --looking at the rising prices without forgetting the rising standard of living. There is poverty in [GPE]. We talk a lot about it [DATE]--and we are doing a lot about it. There is want and there is some hunger--there is more of each than any of us would like to have. But I think most of you people that I am looking at here [TIME] in [GPE], like most of my fellow [NORP] that I have seen in [CARDINAL] [GPE], are [TIME] enjoying the best standard of living that you have ever known. Now it may be in [DATE] some of you were doing better. It may be in [DATE] some of you were doing better. It may be in [DATE] some of you were doing better. But I think the majority of us are doing better now than we have ever done before. Now prices have gone up. They have gone up [PERCENT] since [DATE]. And they will probably go up again. During that same time, though, wages have gone up, too. And they are going up some more. They have gone up not [PERCENT] as the prices have, but the wages have gone up [PERCENT] and most of you can buy more [TIME] than you could with your paycheck [DATE]. In [DATE] the average wage--I try to make this as understandable as I can--the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much in the retail stores as it would when I came to [GPE] in [DATE]. I want to repeat that because I want all of you to listen to it. In [DATE], [DATE] of our Lord [TIME], the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much at retail as it would when I first came to [GPE] in [DATE]. You could buy more bread, and more butter, and more milk, and more molasses, and more bacon with [TIME] of your earnings [DATE] than you could in [DATE]. And that is also true of steaks, and potatoes, and tomatoes, and liver--if you ever eat it. It is a fact that [NORP] are eating better food at a lower real cost than they have ever eaten before. After you get through paying your taxes--to all the Presidents and Governors and I do not know whether Senators and Congressmen think they have anything to do with it or not--but after you get through paying your taxes, your family is spending [PERCENT] of its income on food, [PERCENT] [TIME], [DATE], compared to [PERCENT] of its income that it was paying [DATE]. So, I repeat--prices have gone up, and they are going to go up some more. We are going to do our best to have stabilization, but they have gone up and they will go up some more--but so has your standard of living gone up. And it is going up some more, too. We have a goal, we have an objective, we have a future for [GPE]. We want to leave this world better than we found it. We have advantages that our fathers and our grandfathers did not have. And we want our children to have things that we do not have ourselves. So, prices have gone up and your standard of living has gone up, too. I hope you will keep that in perspective. You know, I think that may have been what President [PERSON]'s friend meant when he saw President [PERSON] during the [DATE] campaign. You remember President [PERSON] asked him how he was voting. And his friend said, [NORP]. How come? President [PERSON] asked. Is the third term bothering you? .... No, the friend answered, that is not it at all. It is just that I voted [NORP] the first time you ran --this fellow lived in [GPE], not in [GPE], but in Maine-- and I voted [NORP] the second time you ran --that was [DATE], you know-- And I am going to vote [NORP] again, because I seem to have never had it so good! Now this is not to say that we should or we will ignore the threat that is made to our stabilization program and that comes with inflation. But keeping things in perspective will not chase the threat away. I want you to know that, as your President, [DATE] that I open my office I am going to be concerned about rising prices and will try to do as much as I intelligently can about them. But I am as deeply concerned with finding the right way to deal with inflation. And that brings me back to my central point. [TIME] at [ORG] I said along with rights we have responsibilities. [TIME] I want to leave this point: self-discipline. The ideal way to keep the economy healthy without inflation is restraint--restraint on the part of those whose decisions have a real impact on prices. And I am looking into a lot of faces of people who make decisions that can probably have more impact on prices than I can. For [DATE] now I have urged business and labor in many, many conferences I have had at [ORG] to bargain responsibly to reach decisions that will not trigger inflation. And I am proud to report to you that many businessmen and many labor leaders have responded with restraint and with self-discipline to their President's pleas. I am sad to report to you that not all of them have, and as a result we are faced [TIME] with a real danger to the prosperity which you have enjoyed for [DATE]. I would like for all [NORP] to know, those who can hear it and those who can read, unless there is restraint now, unless there is voluntary self-discipline by management and labor, then your Government will be compelled by sheer necessity to act in order to protect all of the people. For in a democracy, the interest of all the people is, and should be, always overriding. And it is Government's duty and it is your president's duty, and he will exercise that duty by trying to reason-- come reason together --to protect that interest. But if, after we reason and after we appeal for self-discipline, after we ask for restraint, there are still general excesses, then I pledge you [TIME] we are going to protect your interests. Now that sums up about all I have to say on the inflation problem. This will end my speaking for [DATE]--at least [DATE]. I have told you the general subjects we have discussed. I just want to conclude by talking about one that we have not discussed. We have been talking about problems. But I want to talk about successes. I want to talk about [DATE] in [GPE] when we have [CARDINAL] people working, working full [TIME] [DATE], some of them drawing good overtime, working at an average factory wage in excess of $[MONEY] per week-the highest in the history of this [ORG]-more people working, getting more pay, than at any time in the history of this [ORG]. We have the best education and health programs that any government has ever inaugurated. Our citizens are eating more. They are wearing more. Their children are going to better schools. They are driving better automobiles and more of them--some people even have [CARDINAL]. They are living in better homes, although all of them do not have good homes. And except for our problems in [GPE], we have so much to be thankful for. So when you go home [TIME] after having listened to those whose principal job [DATE] has been complaining, to those who got up on the wrong side of the bed and have been martyrs all day long, feeling that nobody loved them and they had been mistreated, just think about what other country you would like to trade your citizenship in for. Just think about what other flag in the world represents as much to you as that one does. Just think of what boy and girl that you know who has more constitutional rights, more liberty, more freedom, more educational opportunity, more care of their body and their health, more opportunity for recreation, more opportunity to make individual decisions and be independent of everybody than you have here in [GPE]. I have never felt that our people were unreasonably demanding. I think the average [NORP] does not ask much, does not expect much, does not have to have much. He wants a church where he can worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. He wants a home where he and his wife can raise their family in comfort. He wants a job where he can earn enough to meet his responsibilities as a parent. He wants to be able to provide health care for his growing family and security for his old age. And he may want to go to a park or a seashore once in a while, or even a movie, or to sit and listen to television. But outside of that, that is about all he asks for. And most of us have that and we ought to be thankful for it. So if I could leave [CARDINAL] thought with you, finally. I have gotten great strength from visiting with you and looking into your faces and giving you my views. I have learned something from you, too, you people in the [CARDINAL] [GPE] that I have visited. I can go back and listen to the complainers-if there be any in [GPE]--the commentators, I can hear their individual viewpoints. But I will have enough strength to make my judgments and my decisions, because every man that is ever been President of [GPE] wants to make the right decision. No man who has ever been President, whether it was [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], or [PERSON]--every single man that has ever been President, wanted to do what is right. Their great problem is knowing what is right because most of the decisions that come to a President are balanced just like this. The easy ones are settled by the Congressmen, the Senators, and Governors. [DATE] or [DATE], when we settled the airlines strike the first time, before the machinists had had their vote on it and had a chance to express themselves, I picked up some of the leading journals of this country which really have a good deal of information on a good many subjects. [CARDINAL] of the editorials said that I was a dictator, and I had arrogance of power, and I twisted arms, and I had brought about an agreement. That made me sad, because I do not like for people to say ugly things about me and I do not want to be a dictator. And then, [DATE] they did not ratify the contract. They turned it down and [DATE] went by. Some of the writers had to ride a train from [GPE] to [GPE] instead of being able to go by airplane. So then they said, not that he was a dictator, but they said, Why does not he show some leadership? So then I was talking to [PERSON] about it. I said, I am between the devil and the deep blue sea. I do not want to be a dictator; I do want to have some leadership. Now how do I go about it? He said it reminded him of the story about the fellow and the donkey. He said, A man was walking along with a donkey. Someone said, 'Why would a man want to lead a donkey? Why does not he ride it?' Said he got on the donkey and the little boy he had with him was walking along beside him. Someone said, 'Why did that old, big man get on a donkey and let that little boy walk?' So the fellow said, 'OK, ' and put the little boy on the donkey. As they went on down the road a little bit, [CARDINAL] of these complainers saw the little donkey coming along with the man and the boy both on it and they said, 'Why do those [CARDINAL] big men ride that poor little donkey?' And they went on down a little bit further and finally someone said, 'That is an outrage! Why do not - they carry the donkey?' Now dissent, different viewpoints, different objectives are the strength of [GPE]. We do not all see everything alike or we would all belong to the same church, we would all wear the same clothes, we would all drive the same automobile, and we would all want the Same Wife. It is this difference and this right to express it that makes this the most powerful, the most wealthy, the most stable nation in all the world. But while we are exercising all these rights we have, all these liberties we cherish, all these privileges that we claim, let us not ever lose completely our perspective. Let us not start feeling so sorry for ourselves that we fail to be thankful and that we fail to realize really how many blessings we have. Thank you, and good [TIME].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalhispanicfoundationforthearts", "text": "Well, first of all, let me say thank you for the welcome. I thank the members of [ORG] who are here and other Members of [ORG] and the people from our administration who are here. I want to thank [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And I want to congratulate your honorees, [PERSON] and [ORG], for [DATE] of service. I want to say a special word of appreciation to all the [NORP] who have been part of our administration, including [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and all the others. Let me say, I am sorry I am not in proper attire [TIME]. But [PERSON] called me [TIME], and I only had [CARDINAL] other things I was supposed to do, and so he said I had to show. And I want you to know I am here in spite of the fact that [PERSON] called me. And I will tell you why. If I have to hear [PERSON] say [CARDINAL] more time, That is the best looking man I have ever seen, I think I will die. So, right before I was here, I went over to [FAC]. And there is a magnificent event at [FAC] that [PERSON] is having about her book on human rights activists, and artists from all over our country and human rights heroes from all over the world are over there [TIME]. And so, I went from there to a book party for my friend [PERSON]. And I am on my way over here, and everybody wanted to know where I was going. And this [ORG] television reporter said, [PERSON], that is the best looking man I ever saw in my life. So, I said, Well, what can I tell you? I have been to war for [DATE] now, and I do not look very good anymore. He will never forgive me for embarrassing him like that. I want to say something seriously. [PERSON], I appreciate what you have done so much with this foundation. And I want to say, I made fun of [PERSON] [TIME], but I want you to know that becoming a friend of his has been one of the real joys of being [SPEAKER]. He has been so kind to my wife and to me, to our family. He is been to [FAC] many times, and he is always been there for a good cause. And I hope you will forgive me for pulling your leg [TIME], [PERSON], but I will never forget you for being our friend. Thank you very much. I want to thank [ORG] for giving young people a chance. From the silver screen to the [FAC] stage, kids with talent and dreams need a chance. That is what we have tried to do for [DATE] now for all [GPE]'s children. And the Vice [SPEAKER] and I owe those of you who have done so much to help us do that a profound debt of gratitude, and I thank you. [TIME] I came mostly just to do that, just to say thank you, for all you do for the arts, for all you do for the [NORP] community, and for all you have done to help [GPE] move forward in [DATE]. We now have the lowest [NORP] unemployment rate we have ever recorded, the lowest [NORP] poverty rate in [DATE], [CARDINAL] new homeowners in [DATE]. The earned-income tax credit has been doubled, and it is lifted over [CARDINAL] [NORP] out of poverty. The minimum wage helped [CARDINAL] [NORP] workers, and it is time to raise it again and help more. The Hispanic Education Action Plan to encourage [NORP] youth to stay in school and go to college, along with our scholarship initiatives and other things, have contributed to the fact that the college-going rate among [NORP] young people is up [PERCENT] in [DATE]. And-listen to this-a report which was issued [DATE] said there has been a [PERCENT] increase in the number of [NORP] students taking advanced placement courses in high school to prepare for college. Under the [ORG] [SPEAKER]'s leadership, we have reduced the naturalization backlog at [ORG]. And under [PERSON] leadership, loans to [NORP] entrepreneurs by the [ORG] have increased by [PERCENT]. We have all been enriched by your work. And I know that because of your work, we will have more great singers, more great writers, more great actors and actresses. I know we have got a long way to go, too, because still [NORP] characters are [PERCENT] of those that appear on prime-time television. I just left [PERSON], and I told her that I enjoyed watching her as a nun on her television series. And we were laughing about it. And I think that you will see, if you keep working, though, more and more of our movies and our television shows and our [FAC] shows reflecting the rich diversity of [GPE]. And that is the last point I want to make. I have said on many occasions, and I will just say [CARDINAL] more time [TIME], that if I could have [CARDINAL] wish for [GPE], believe it or not, it would not be for a continued unbroken economic prosperity. It would be that somehow we would find the wisdom to live together as brothers and sisters, to truly be one [GPE] across all the lines that divide us. And to-just sort of a little picture of how fast [GPE] has changed; you may see the advertisements [DATE] for-they are on television now-for [PERSON] new movie about the integration of [ORG] over in [GPE], [GPE], and its football team, which occurred-what-[DATE], not such a long time ago once you have reached my age, anyway. Now, [DATE], that high school is in a school district which has students from [CARDINAL] different racial and ethnic groups, parents speaking [CARDINAL] different native languages. It is the most diverse school district in [GPE]. And I think it is sort of fitting that this movie, coming out in [DATE], talks about something that to most of these kids is ancient history, that we hope they will never forget. But it is sobering to look at the profile of them and realize that they are both the great opportunity and the great challenge of the future: Can we figure out a way to give them all a world-class education, with all their diversity? Can we figure out a way to make sure that every single child, every family, every faith in [GPE] is profoundly proud of its roots, understands them, and yet believes deep in the core of being that our common humanity is even more important than our unique characteristics? These are very big questions. Not so long ago, a number of you in this room came to [FAC] for a showing of Mi Familia, the movie. Remember, you saw it; you were there. And so I was thinking about that [TIME] and feeling sort of nostalgic. And I think the central question that all of us have to ask ourselves, both within and beyond our borders now, is who is in our family anyway? There is an astonishing new book out, been out [DATE], by a man named [PERSON], called Non Zero, kind of a weird title unless you are familiar with game theory. But in game theory, a [CARDINAL]-sum game is one where, in order for [CARDINAL] person to win, somebody has to lose. A non-zero-sum game is a game in which you can win, and the person you are playing with can win, as well. And the argument of the book is that, notwithstanding all the terrible things that happened in [DATE] the abuses of science by the [NORP], the abuses of organization by the [NORP], all the things that continue to be done in the name of religious or political purity-essentially, as societies grow more and more connected, and we become more interdependent, one with the other, we are forced to find more and more non-zero-sum solutions. That is, ways in which we can all win. And that is basically the message I have been trying to preach for [DATE] here, that everybody counts; everybody deserves a chance; we all do better when we help each other. We have to have an expanding idea of who is in our family. And we in [GPE], because we are so blessed, have particular responsibilities to people not only within our borders who have been left behind but beyond our borders who otherwise will never catch up if we do not do our part, because we are all part of the same human family and because, actually, life is more and more a non-zero-sum game, so that the better they do, the better we will do. Now, I believe, because of the history and culture, because of the pain and the promise of the [NORP] community in [GPE], you are uniquely qualified to make sure [GPE] learns this lesson now. And so that is the last thing I'd like to say from the heart. You have made being [SPEAKER] [DATE] a joy. It has been an honor for me to work with so many of you. If our country is better off because of anything I did, I am grateful. But all the best stuff is still out there if we can learn to preserve what is special about us and our clan, our tribe, and our faith, and do it while affirming our common humanity. Do that for [GPE], and the best is still out there. Thank you, and God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Thank you, [PERSON], and all of you. Thank you very much, [PERSON], and thank all of you. My heavens, [CARDINAL] different [NORP], I am told, represented here by all of you. [PERSON], I cannot begin to thank you, not only for your friendship and loyal support but your service to the Government, to the people, I would put it that way, and also for your outstanding commitment to small business and your own accomplishments in that field. I also want to acknowledge [PERSON]'s wife, [PERSON], who is the Chairman of [ORG]; my old friend [PERSON] here, chairman of [ORG]. [PERSON] from [ORG] gave up an awful lot to move over there to fight this drug scourge, and I am very proud of her. Reverend [PERSON], we all know [PERSON]. He ought to be praying more and talking less out there on the campaign -- -- I need that, I will tell you. But somebody once gave me a little rug, and it said, What would we do without friends? I am grateful that [PERSON] and so many others out here are true and loyal friends. When the going is tough, they are hanging in there. I want to salute [PERSON], the chairman of [ORG]. I was very grateful to Reverend [PERSON] for that invocation, for his leadership in education, for his commitment and faith. Thank you, sir, for coming and for doing that. Of course, I cannot say too much about [PERSON]. I love it when we talk about genuine health care reform for this country. He summarized it in his remarks there, giving me the credit. But he is out there on the cutting edge. When a paper like [ORG], which has not been overly friendly to me [DATE] -- -- points out that we have got a sound, or the best of the health care reform programs out there, why, I am very grateful to [PERSON]. He is tireless in taking the message across the country, and he is leading this, the largest Government bureau, with such distinction and honor. I tell you, we are lucky to have him in the Government. [PERSON] is not clapping too hard. Maybe she wants him back; I do not know. But nevertheless. May I salute [PERSON], distinguished Member of [ORG]. I do not see him, but I know he is here. Where is [PERSON]? Well, he is not here. All right, he is late. He is to be here; [PERSON], a Member of [ORG] [ORG], with us here [DATE], too. I want to single out a warrior. Some of you know her just by seeing her on television. Some of you know her for seeing her at my side as I climb on the helicopter or Air Force One or go to take on some political debate. And I am talking about [PERSON]'s able deputy, [PERSON], who is standing right over here. [PERSON], I do not want this to come out wrong, but you talk about tough women. I mean, she is strong, and in a wonderful way. She takes it and can dish it out just as well. It is tough out there in that press arena. But boy, she is doing a superb job for me and I think for the country because she gets out our position on fundamental issues that are important to the [ORG]. Let me just talk for [TIME]. I am off to [GPE] in [TIME] and then to [GPE]. So I want to just talk a little bit about the concerns that we share about the future of this great country, about the choice that we have in shaping that future. I will spare you a stemwinding political oration, but I will just point out that we have got a great task before us, and the differences are clear. With the end of the cold war that Reverend [PERSON] very generously referred to, now we have got to turn our attention to winning the new global economic competition. The other side is telling us everything that is wrong about the economy, and I will accept my share of the blame. But we are caught up in something worldwide. And any fair-minded observer knows that it is not just [GPE] that is had difficult economic times. It is [GPE]. It is [GPE]. It is [GPE]. It is [GPE] now. A lot of countries in this, and we have the strongest economy of all of them. It is my objective to make it even stronger. I call that winning the peace, for only then will we keep the promise of opportunity that is the birthright of every [NORP]. I am proud of the fact that our kids go to bed at [TIME] without that same fear of nuclear weapons that their predecessors had. This is, I think, a significant accomplishment, and I salute everyone in our administration that worked to help end that nuclear nightmare. But now we have got to do the same thing, apply that same leadership, and lift this country up. You know, the Governor, Governor [PERSON], and I offer very different choices. They are really based on very different philosophies, different experience. He is spent most of his life in government. He believes that government, kind of a [GPE] elite, should take the lead in shaping the economy. He uses the word investing : investing your money, that is taxpayers' money, more wisely than you can as entrepreneurs and individuals. Well, that is not the way I see it at all. Like so many of you, I have spent [PERCENT] of my adult life in business and [PERCENT] in government. Not with the sparkling success that some in this room have had as business people, but nevertheless, I understand it. I built a business from the ground up. I met a payroll, created jobs, and worked for a living. I happen to think that that is a good qualification for being [SPEAKER] of [GPE], because I believe it is a prospering small business or large business environment that is going to do more to help people. Put it this way, a job in the private sector is going to do more to help people than Government programs can. I learned in that private sector what many of you not only have learned but have mastered: what makes an economy grow. It is not central planning, quote, investing, unquote, the taxpayers' money. It is not the people who take your taxes and spend them. It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real. And I am very grateful to what [PERSON] does in taking this message of small business out around this country. That understanding is really at the heart of what [PERSON] again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we are going to do now to be the lead. We are the only remaining military superpower. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. I want to see us become an export superpower as well. To do this, we have got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities. I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That is why I am helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program [DATE] down in [GPE]. I will just touch on a couple of points: Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business [PERCENT]; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many work [TIME], too many people [TIME], and we are trying to change that. Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most. So to the business people here, we are trying to streamline so you will not have to be second-guessed back here in [GPE] by some bureaucratic establishment. And that is why we have put an end to the [ORG] regulations that turn redtape into pink slips. We just put out a moratorium on them. We are going to go forward with safety and health; obviously we have to do that. But we have got a moratorium, a blanket on new regulations, recognizing that there is too much control and regulation on the back of the small entrepreneur and the small-business person. We really do want to do what [PERSON] was talking about, and that is to make health insurance available to everyone. We want to make health care more accessible and more affordable for everyone. That is why we are all -- have our shoulders to the wheel, fighting for health care reform without burdening small businesses with expensive new mandates and more payroll taxes. Our program is good. It keeps the quality of [NORP] health care where it belongs, number [CARDINAL] in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we are going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we are going to reduce the costs. We are doing something about these crazy malpractice suits and also doing something about lifting the regulatory burden and streamlining the operating processes of our health care system. So we have got a good program there, and I hope that it'll get the kind of support in the very next [ORG] that we need to have it enacted into law. I want to reward the risktakers who bring capital and jobs to our inner cities; I touched on that. But it is very interesting to me that when we went to [GPE] in the wake of the South Central problems, all the civic leaders there were saying we must have enterprise zones. It is an idea whose time has come. We ought to try it at the Federal level. So we are fighting hard to bring the enterprise zones into reality. On issue after issue, you see the very sharp differences between my opponent and me, because he really does want a Government. He is already proposed more taxes, more spending, more regulations. He is already proposed programs that would result in the latter, in the last item, and tax plans and spending plans that would tax at the outset [MONEY] more in taxes and [MONEY] more in spending. It is going to kill off a lot of small business. So we want to free up, instead, the genius of [NORP] enterprise and initiative. This is going to be one of the clearest distinctions as people begin to really make up their minds on this election. Let me be clear: I am not anti-Government. Government must never shirk its responsibilities. The fine men and women honored here [DATE] who I have been proud to have at my side for [DATE] are a testament to the good work that Government can do. We believe it is Government's role to create opportunity, though, and not stifle it, and to clear the path for individual accomplishment, not to block it; to facilitate, not to dictate. Together, we believe that there is no room in our country, and I want to repeat this here, for discrimination of any kind whatsoever. As long as I am [SPEAKER], I am going to do absolutely everything I can in my power to drive bigotry and anti-Semitism and racism from our great land. You know, I hope you know that I have strong feelings about this. [PERSON] and [PERSON] and I were talking. I am not sure the [NORP] people know how strongly I feel about this. That is one of the reasons I hope we get these debates on. We have proposed [CARDINAL] debates with the Governor. Let him step up now and debate. We have accepted his formula for [CARDINAL] of them, and so, we will have an opportunity there without any filters, without any [DATE] morning quarterbacks telling you what you thought you heard, to take the case directly to the [NORP] people. I have tried in my public life -- like supporting fair housing when I was a Member of [ORG] from [GPE] and fighting for I think decent civil rights legislation, whether it is the ADA bill or an antidiscriminatory civil rights bill. I think we got, and others here have mentioned this very generously, an excellent record of appointing officials on the content of their character and their competence to positions of high authority in the Government. I am proud of what both [PERSON] and [PERSON] talked about, to have appointed a higher percentage of blacks and women in the history of the Presidency to important positions. Some are here with us [DATE]: [PERSON] at [ORG], who is now going on to new pursuits. I mentioned [PERSON], who served with such distinction in several capacities. Some are nonpolitical. I think it is a wonderful thing that [PERSON] is the Chairman of [ORG]. I do not know anything about his politics, and I could not care less. I know something about his character, though. I know something about his ability, though. I know something of how it is when he is making tough, tough decisions regarding the life of somebody else's son and daughter, and that is all I need to know in selecting the best Chairman of [ORG]. [PERSON], we all know her, how she served with great distinction in this administration; and a most beloved figure, [PERSON]. I mentioned [PERSON], of course. I mentioned [PERSON] for the [ORG]. But we have got others, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], all women in high-level positions. I am proud of [PERSON] over at [ORG]. You talk abut a tough assignment, there is a decent man and a man of honor, fulfilling an extraordinarily tough assignment over at [ORG]. My old friend [PERSON] is head of the [ORG]. Let me tell you something: I am not going to let the political diatribes going on out there and attacks coming out of some radical groups diminish the pride I take in having appointed [PERSON] to [ORG]. So let others try to smear a decent man. I am standing with him. He is going to be a great Justice. You watch. You just wait. He is just beginning. He is going to be outstanding. So we are here to salute all of you -- I came over to do that -- and to thank you, those in Government, for serving and serving with integrity. I will tell you something: Our administration has been a clean administration. You look back over your shoulders. We have not had scandals because we have honorable men and women who sacrifice to serve their country. I am proud of each and every one of you. And in terms of those others who are out in the private sector employing people, creating opportunity, living the [NORP] dream, I salute you as well. We want to facilitate what you are doing, not get Government in the way and make it tougher. So this is the message we will be taking to the [NORP] people, and I believe we are going to get this job done. It has not been [DATE] for [PERSON] and me; I will have to confess that. Indeed, I have been around the political track for a long time, and I have never seen quite the anger and the ugliness in the political process, the willingness to twist and distort and make things ugly. But it is worth it; you know it. It is worth it because we have accomplished a lot for this country. We have accomplished a lot on the world scene as well. Now I want to finish the job, finish the job by bringing opportunity and hope to all [NORP], and I am very grateful to each and every one of you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthencaafootballchampionuniversitytennesseevolunteers", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. Well, chancellor and Coach [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] this is the most disgusting pander I have ever seen. You know, Coach [PERSON] came up [TIME], and he and [PERSON] practiced all this [CARDINAL] times. We are going to be cited by [ORG] for this event. Let me tell you you know, I am not running for anything. I can tell you the whole story about this this [GPE]-Arkansas deal. Everything he said is true. And for all of you who are covering this who are not from [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] [GPE], let me the game was an unbelievable game, and [GPE] was ahead at the end. And there was [TIME] to go, and we seemed to have an insurmountable lead. And our quarterback was trying to kill the clock, a little of the clock. And the [GPE] line broke through the [GPE] offensive line and tackled him behind the line. And he fell, not with his free hand but with the hand on the ball, which squirted out into the arms of [GPE]. And the rest is history. Who is responsible for that over there? Raise your hand, there. Give him a hand over there. Bring that guy up here. Get him up here. Come on. And what you really do not what [PERSON] could not tell you, because he is not like me; I am not running for anything is that I was actually watching this game as this foreign policy crisis was unfolding. And I was talking on the phone, injecting things, and they thought, you know, I was being tougher on what was happening on the phone, and I was really just reacting to the ballgame. But to be fair, to be perfectly fair to [GPE], I think that you had [QUANTITY] still to go Coach [PERSON]. [CARDINAL]. [SPEAKER]. for a touchdown, right? [CARDINAL]. So it was not like he fumbled on the goal line. And they rolled down there like there was nobody there. And they won the game, and they went on to the national championship. And I paid off my bet, and The Vice President. I will get you some ribs. [SPEAKER]. and we have had a lot of laughs about it. But I do want to say, you know, I was the first President from my home [GPE] ever elected. I owe a lot to [GPE]; if it had not been for the Vice President joining the ticket, I might not have won the first time, almost certainly would not have won the second time, because we made all the record we made together. And so I feel deeply indebted. And all I can say is, we are even now. Actually, I was very impressed. I like teams, and people, who do not quit, who never say die, and who stick together. I like the fact that this team had a lot of stars, at different times during the year, but won as a team. You had [PERSON] caught a, what, a 76- and a [CARDINAL]-yard touchdown pass in the Fiesta Bowl, but he would not have been there to catch those passes if this guy had not broken through the line, somebody else had not kicked a field goal, and if all the guys in the line who never get their names called on television did not show up for every play and play like crazy. And I think it is important. And I think it is a real tribute to these young men, and to their fine coach. And I think it should be obvious to anybody who knows anything about college football, and anything about this coach, anything about this program, that this is a program, and a team, founded not just on strength and speed and talent but also on thinking and effort and courage and good values. And in that sense, in winning the national championship and in winning it the way they did, in a highly competitive season, they reflected credit on the entire [GPE]. And every every person in [GPE] should be proud of them. I certainly am, and I wish you well in getting back [DATE]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthephilharmonicclubturinitaly", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], [PERSON] Fellow Citizens: You show your welcome in many delightful ways and in no more delightful way than that in which you have shown it in this room. The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which Senor [PERSON] has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of [NORP] effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home-a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an [NORP] city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war. Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We direct and others execute. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that hold tight. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of [GPE] or the glory of [GPE] shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great [PERSON], and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in [GPE] since, how impossible the great achievements of [GPE] in [DATE], would have been without the work of [PERSON]. Ever since I was a boy [CARDINAL] of my treasured portraits has been a portrait of [PERSON]; because I had read about him, of the way in which his mind took in the nation, the national scope of it, of the strong determined patriotic endeavor that never allowed obstacles to dismay him, and of the way he always stood at the side of the King and planned the great things which the King was enabled to accomplish. And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at [GPE] as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is [CARDINAL] reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest. I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to [GPE] to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations. And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes. We have the same ideals; and this war has done this inestimable service: It has brought nations into close vital contact, so that they feel the pulses that are in each other, so that they know the purposes by which each is animated. We know in [GPE] a great deal about [GPE], because we have so many [NORP] fellow citizens. When Baron [PERSON] was arguing [DATE] for the extension of the sovereignty of [GPE] over [NORP] populations, I said, I am sorry we can not let you have [GPE], which, I understand, is the greatest [NORP] city in the world. I am told that there are more [NORP] in [GPE] than in any city in [GPE], and I am proud to be [SPEAKER] of a Nation which contains so large an element of the [NORP] race, because, as a student of literature, I know the genius that has originated in this great nation, the genius of thought and of poetry and of philosophy and of music, and I am happy to be a part of a Nation which is enriched and made better by the introduction of such elements of genius and of inspiration. May I not again thank the representative of this great city and the representative of the Government for the welcome they have given me, and say again, for I can not say it too often, [PERSON]?", "discourse_type": 0}

Anyone that has not gotten his cuff links or tickets to [FAC], please see [PERSON]. Well, ladies and gentlemen, members of the [ORG] and staff and all of you who are here, I do not think [FAC] has ever seen exactly this kind of meeting here before. And I think [DATE] we saw an extraordinary example of cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of government, and I want all of you Members of the [ORG] to know how deeply grateful I am for what you did [DATE]. During [DATE] we have worked well together, and I think we have made a little history. Thanks to you, we have made it clear that spending can be controlled and that our system works. The voice of the people can be heard here in the [GPE], and in so doing, we have restored their confidence of our people in their government and in the institutions of this Government. I know that what we did was only the first step, but I have confidence that in [DATE] we will continue to put country ahead of partisanship. Yes, we have a big job ahead of us putting tax cuts into effect that are really the other [CARDINAL] of returning [GPE]'s prosperity. I believe the reduction in the tax rates, as I know I have said to many of you, is essential to restoring the spirit of enterprise. You know, [DATE] there was an economist at [ORG], now deceased, [PERSON]. And he said once that if a visitor from Mars came to Earth, he would conclude that our tax policy had been created to make private enterprise unworkable. And, you know, maybe what he was talking about, sometimes in a business or a sports team or an army, will outperform its competitor even though the material assets of the [CARDINAL] seem to be roughly equal. Now, some academicians have commented-well, they have referred to this as the x factor in human affairs, a confidence or a spirit that makes men and women dream and dare and take greater risks. Well, for too long a time our tax structure has stifled that x factor and that spirit of confidence and daring in our economic doings here in our land. Those who have the means to invest have sought tax shelters instead. And workers have been discouraged from saving or even trying to increase their earnings by increasing their productivity. I think the people have told us they want to see [GPE] return to the can-do spirit that made this country an industrial and economic giant. Would I be wrong in suggesting that all of us here [DATE] feel a kind of special closeness? It is a feeling, I think, born of standing together for something we believed in. And I appreciate the courage it took for some of you to take that stand. I hope that we can maintain this bond established so far in [DATE] to come. And again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheresignationalanbkruegerchairmanthecouncileconomicadvisersandthe", "text": "Good [TIME], all of you. It is now been [DATE] since an economic crisis and a punishing recession came together to cost far too many [NORP] their jobs and their homes and the sense of security that they had built up over time. And by the time I took office, my team and I were facing bubbles that had burst, markets that had cratered, bank after bank on the verge of collapse. And the heartbeat of [NORP] manufacturing, our auto industry, was flatlining. And all this meant that [CARDINAL] of [NORP] were losing their jobs [DATE]. So this was a scary time. And nobody had any idea where the bottom would be. [DATE], our businesses have created [CARDINAL] new jobs over [DATE]. The [NORP] auto industry has come roaring back. We are producing more of our own energy; we are consuming less that we import from other countries. Our deficits are shrinking rapidly. The cost of health care is slowing. The housing market is rebounding. People's retirement savings are growing. The wealth that was lost from that recession has now been recovered. All of this progress is a testament to the grit and resolve of the [NORP] people, most of all. But it is also due in some measurable way to the incredible dedication of the men and women who helped to engineer [GPE]'s response. And [CARDINAL] of those people are standing next to me, [CARDINAL] very smart economists: [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [DATE] I can announce that [PERSON] is heading back to teach his beloved students at [PERSON]'s alma mater, [ORG]. When they get together, all they can talk about is [ORG], and they are all very proud, and those of us who did not go to [ORG] have to put up with it. And I am proud to say that [PERSON] has agreed to replace [PERSON] as the Chairman of my [ORG]. Now, during the crisis, [PERSON] stepped in initially to help engineer our response as Assistant Secretary and chief economist at [ORG]. He was so good that we then had to beg him to come back, extend his tour, to serve as the Chairman of my [ORG], where he is been the driving force behind actions that we have taken to help restart the flow of lending to small businesses and create new jobs and arm workers with the skills they need to fill them, to reduce income inequality, to rebuild our aging infrastructure, and to bring down our deficits in a responsible way. And [PERSON] is driven by the basic bargain at the heart of our economy: the idea that hard work should be rewarded. He is motivated by the principle that no one who works full time in the greatest nation on Earth should have to raise their families in poverty or below poverty levels. His commitment to a rising, thriving middle class shines through in his often passionate presentations andat least for an economist, they are passionate and in the policies that he is pushed, and I know this will continue to be a focus of his research. [PERSON]'s wife and son are here [DATE], and I know that they are all looking forward to having [PERSON] back. And now that [PERSON] has some free time, he can return to another burning passion of his: rockonomics, the economics of rock and roll. This is something that [PERSON] actually cares about; seriously, on [DATE], he is giving a speech at [ORG]. He is got a T-shirt under his suit with a big tongue sticking out. Do not show it. So [PERSON] has become one of my most trusted advisers. He is become a wonderful friend. I am sad to see him go. But I know that he will continue to do outstanding work, and fortunately, he will still be available for us to consult with him periodically, because he is a constant font of good ideas about how we can further help the [NORP] people. So thank you very much, [PERSON], for all the good work that you have done. Now, I am also proud to nominate another outstanding economist to take his place. [PERSON] is one of the most brilliant economic minds of his generation. Do not take my word for it: You can talk to other economists who know a lot more than I do about it. He is won the respect and admiration from his peers across the political spectrum. His Ph.D. thesis adviser, [PERSON], chaired [ORG] under [PERSON]. Nobel Prize Winner [PERSON], on the other side of the economic spectrum, hired [PERSON] to work for the [ORG] under President [PERSON]. After leaving President [PERSON]'s [ORG], [PERSON] finished his Ph.D. in economics, quickly acquired a reputation as a world-class scholar and researcher. But public service kept calling, and [PERSON]'s kept answering that call because he believes deeply in it. So from working at [ORG] on issues of inequality and international finance to developing new proposals to strengthen our health and retirement programs, he helped to shape some of our most important economic policy debates. And when I asked him to join my team in [DATE], even though his baby daughterthat's right you were this big, had just been bornhe agreed to serve once again. And over [DATE], I have come to trust not only his head, but also his heart, because [PERSON] never forgets who it is that we are fighting for: middle class families, folks who are working hard to climb their way into the middle class, the next generation. And when the stakes are highest, there is no one I'd rather turn to for straightforward, unvarnished advice that helps me to do my job. He understands all sides of an argument, not just [CARDINAL] side of it. He is worked tirelessly on just about every major economic challenge of [DATE], from averting a second depression to fighting for tax cuts that help [CARDINAL] of working families make ends meet, to creating new incentives for businesses to hire, to reducing our deficits in a balanced way that benefits the middle class. And so [PERSON], [PERSON]'s wife, who is an accomplished writer herself, has put up with a lot of [TIME] with [PERSON] away. [PERSON] and [PERSON], who are here, they have made a lot of sacrifices so that their husband and dad could be here working for the [NORP] people. So I appreciate you guys for sharing daddy just a little bit longer. And the reason it is important is because, while we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid a new foundation for growth, our work is nowhere near done. Even though the economy is growing, too many middle class families still feel like they are working harder and harder and cannot get ahead. Inequality is still growing in our society. Too many young people are not sure whether they will be able to match the living standards of their parents. We have too many kids in poverty in this country still. There are some basic steps that we can take to strengthen the position of working people in this country, to help our economy grow faster, to make sure that it is more competitive. And some of that requires political will. Some of it requires an abiding passion for making sure everybody in this country has a fair shot. But it also requires good economists. I know it is called a dismal science, but I do not find it that dismal. I think it is actually pretty interesting. [PERSON] and [PERSON] appreciate that. So sometimes, the rest of my staff thinks, oh, [PERSON] is getting together with his economists, and they are going to have a wonkfest for [TIME]. But this stuff matters. It is not just numbers on a page. It makes a difference in terms of whether or not people get a chance at life and also, how do we optimize opportunity and make sure that itwe do not have a contradiction between an efficient, growing, free market economy, and one in which everybody gets a fair shot and where we are caring for the vulnerable and the disabled and folks in our society who need help. So a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, that rewards hard work and responsibility, that is our north star. [PERSON] shares that focus. I know [PERSON] shares that passion. In [PERSON]'s new role as the Chairman of [ORG], he will be working with some of our country's leading economists, including [PERSON], who has joined us. And I am relying on them to provide analysis and recommendations with just one thing in mind: What is going to do the most good for the most people in this country, not what is best for a political party, not what is best for a special interest. I do not have another election. It is not what is best for mewhat's best for our middle class, and everybody who is working hard to get there. That is what the [NORP] people deserve. So I would urge the [ORG] to swiftly confirm [PERSON]. And I want to again thank [PERSON] for his outstanding service. I want to thank [PERSON] and his family for continuing to serve the country they love. And for all the economists in the room, thank you for the occasionally underappreciated work that you do. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthesigningtheasiandevelopmentbankact", "text": "This is a moment in which history and hope meet and move on from here as partners. [DATE], on [DATE], I asked for the creation of the [NORP] development plan to seek economic advance and social justice for all of Asia. I pledged the full support of [GPE] to that task. [DATE] we have begun to redeem that pledge. The act I sign [TIME] authorizes [GPE] to ratify the charter of [ORG]. Seldom have nations joined together in a collective venture that is so endowed with promise. For that reason this moment is a very special one for so many people: First, for the [NORP] leaders, who conceived and organized the bank and who are so ably represented here [DATE] by the Ambassadors from their countries. For the people of those [NORP] nations which have signed the charter, and whose Ambassadors have come [TIME] to bespeak again their vision and their generosity. For my great friend, a true [NORP], [PERSON], whose energy and tact have been as indispensable as his experience and wisdom. And to [ORG] and the members of both parties who have acted to invest in this enterprise not only the resources but the faith of the [CARDINAL] people whom they represent. This act is an economic Magna Carta for the diverse lands of Asia. Its charter links [CARDINAL] countries in a union against the involuntary economic servitude imposed on the people of Asia by time and circumstance and by neighbor and nature. There is also a deeper meaning. This [MONEY] bank is a symbol that the [CARDINAL] have met, not as [PERSON] predicted, at God's great Judgment Seat, but at the place of man's shared needs. It is no longer possible to be a mere observer at that place. It is not possibleand it is not rightto neglect a people's hopes because the ocean is 'vast, or their culture is alien, or their language may be strange, or their race different, or their skin another color. Asia just must no longer sit at the second table of [DATE] concern. The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined. The political order of continents is too involved with one another. The threat of common disaster is too real for all human beings to say of Asia, or any other continent, Yours . . . is another sphere. I believe that those who make that case are no less patriotic and no less sincere than those who believe that we cannot shorten the length of our reach into the world. But I believe equally as firmly that those people are wrong. And while I expect they will continue to make their argument of isolationism versus globalismfor we all are determined to preserve their right to speak up in this landI hope they, too, expect me to try to keep on making my case for realism. And what is that case? It is simply that there is no rest from the trials of freedom, there is no recalling what the pace of change has done to the map of this big world, there is no reducing our responsibilities while the challenges of progress will not permit us to name the site for our duel or the weapons that we use. It is that we cannot turn from the place of shared needs and expect either peace or progress to follow us. So [DATE] we have come here to the historic [FAC] of [FAC] and gathered at this place to start a journey together. [ORG] is the first step of what I conceive to be a very long journey. We are taking another [DATE] by announcing that we have pledged [CARDINAL] of the [MONEY] that is needed to construct the large Mekong River project, the Nam Ngum tributary project in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] other countries, [GPE], the [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE], are joining us in that effort. For [GPE] it is our first major commitment under our promise to expand economic and social development in Southeast Asia. The [GPE] project is [ORG] highest priority undertaking and, like [ORG], it represents a major accomplishment in joint cooperation in the world. The first phase of the project will include a dam and power station with an installed capacity up to [QUANTITY]. Additional generators up to [QUANTITY] can be installed as they are needed. An international transmission line, with a link across the Mekong River, will connect the power station with the capital of [GPE] and northeast [GPE]. This is just [CARDINAL] example of how the fruits of technologyand the ingenuity of cooperation-can bring new life to whole new regions of the world. More, yes, much more, awaits our response. Schools and hospitals can be built. Rivers can be tamed. New crops and new breeds of livestock can be developed. There are no bounds to the possibilities, if there are no limits to our dreams. It has been said that no statue was ever erected to the memory of a man or woman who thought it was best to let well enough alone. So it is with the nations that we represent here [DATE]. We seek no statues to our memory. We seek [CARDINAL] real monument, a monument with peace and progress for its base and justice for its pinnacle. Togetheryour lands and minewe will build it. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthestatedinnerhonoringprimeministerromanoprodiitaly", "text": "Mr. Prime Minister, [DATE] we accomplished a great deal. [TIME] we celebrate the ties that bind us. Those ties begin with the discoveries of [PERSON] and [PERSON], whose busts adorn the Blue Room next door. When the Founders created [ORG], they looked to [GPE] for inspiration. [PERSON] was likened to [PERSON], the [NORP] hero who abandoned his plow to rescue his country by popular demand. I might say, they were the last [CARDINAL] people to head our countries only by popular demand. Poets and philosophers of [ORG] were read and rejuvenated as our new Republic looked to the past to plan our future. In the writings of ancient [NORP] thinkers like [PERSON] and [PERSON], [GPE]'s Founders saw the promise of democratic representative government. Every aspect of our new Republic paid tribute to the simple grandeur of [GPE]: from our architecture to words like senate and capitol. Indeed, after our Constitutional Convention, [PERSON] was asked what our Founders had produced. His simple reply was, A Republic, sir, if you can keep it. Towns sprang up with the names from the ancient [NORP] world, names like [GPE], [GPE], or the Vice President's hometown, [GPE]. Artists portrayed [GPE]'s leaders wearing togas, as the bust of [PERSON] in the hall demonstrates. Thankfully, that is a tradition we have left to [DATE]. In [DATE], our Republic turned into a bustling nation, thanks in no small measure to [NORP]. Ancient [GPE] was replaced by young [GPE] in the [NORP] imagination. And democracy was given new life by heroes like [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [GPE]'s growing cities attracted [CARDINAL] of [NORP], eager to build a new life in a new world. They worked hard. They prospered. [DATE] [NORP], or [NORP], are leaders in every enterprise conducted in our Nation. And as we all know, it is impossible to walk more than a few blocks in any [NORP] city without hearing the words caffe latte. The people here in this room [TIME] are the link between our [CARDINAL] countries, between [CARDINAL] cultures that have nourished each other since [GPE] was just an idea. From our highest courts to our finest tables, from our playing fields to our silver screen, from one side of the aisle in [ORG] to the other, [NORP] have graced our Nation with their intellect, their industry, their good will, and above all, a contagious love of life. Mr. Prime Minister, you have accomplished so much in your time in office. You have presided over a string of economic successes. And [NORP] especially admire your perseverance in leading [GPE] toward [NORP] monetary union. Without [GPE], Europe is not Europe. And without Europe, the world would be a poorer, less free, and much duller place. [GPE] has been a force for peace and security in its region, on the Continent, around the world, in [GPE], in [GPE], and in [GPE], where we are working hard together to bring about a peaceful resolution. [GPE] is proud to know you as a partner and an ally, and we are grateful for your provision of our military bases, sent to help maintain Europe's hard-won peace. Mr. Prime Minister, we take pride in our strong friendship. We know it will continue to grow stronger as we enter [DATE], a word that brings us, once again, back to [GPE]. For just as the Pax Romana spread far and wide through the ancient world, we hope and work for the peace of [DATE] that will allow more people than ever before to live their dreams in security. If we can achieve a peace of [DATE], then the ancient dream of [GPE] to explore new places can be lived by more people than ever-new places in outer space, in biotechnology and medical research, in the hearts and minds of people around the world who still look to [GPE] and [GPE] for confirmation that a good society can be created from many parts. E pluribus unum, the motto of [GPE], a principle cherished by [NORP] and [NORP]: Out of many, [CARDINAL]. Mr. Prime Minister, let us make it so. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister and Mrs. [PERSON] and the people of [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

We are honored here in [FAC] to be joined [DATE] by distinguished Members of the [ORG] and the [ORG]: Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], [CARDINAL] of [PERSON] Senators, Senator [PERSON]. Senator [PERSON] called me [TIME]. He is in [GPE] [DATE] with the First Lady at a health care hearing. And he said he had an excused absence from the Attorney General. The [SPEAKER]and Congressman [PERSON] are here, and we are delighted to see all of them. I also would say we are delighted to be joined by Mr. Justice [PERSON] and Mrs. [PERSON]. Thank you very much for coming. Let me say that it is a great honor for me to be able to be here at this ceremony [DATE] with [PERSON], her family, and a few of her many friends. I'd like to say a special word of thanks to [PERSON], who has served ably and honorably as Acting Attorney General since the Inauguration. I think we owe him a round of applause. [Applause] Somehow I do not think any of my other proposals will pass the [ORG] by the same vote margin- -that [PERSON]'s confirmation did. I especially want to thank Senator [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON] and the members of [ORG] for waiving the normal waiting period between hearings and the confirmation vote, making this event possible [DATE] and making it possible for us to proceed immediately with the urgent tasks at hand. But more than anything else, I think it is clear that [PERSON] made her own swift confirmation possible, showing the [ORG] and all who followed the hearings the qualities of leadership and integrity, intelligence, and humanity that those gathered in this room have recognized for a very long time. You shared with us the life-shaping stories of your family and career that formed your deep sense of fairness and your unwavering drive to help others to do better. You showed us that your career in public service, working on the front lines in your community, fighting crime, understanding the impact on victims and on neighborhoods, mending the gritty social fabric of a vibrant but troubled urban area, is excellent preparation for carrying forward the banner of justice for all the [NORP] people. You will help to guide [ORG] to assist [ORG] and local law enforcement in ways that really count. You demonstrated that you will be a formidable advocate for the vulnerable people in our society and especially for our children. Most of all, you proved to the [ORG] that you are a strong and an independent person who will give me your best legal judgment whether or not it is what I want to hear. It is an experience I have already had, I am glad to say. That is the condition upon which you accepted my nomination and the only kind of Attorney General that I would want serving in this [ORG]. As [PERSON] begins her work at [ORG], she will enter a building that symbolizes our Nation's commitment to justice, to equality, to the enforcement of our laws. On the side of that building, carved above [CARDINAL] of the portals, is the inscription, The halls of justice are a hallowed place. With [PERSON] serving as our Nation's Attorney General, those words will have great meaning for all [NORP].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheuniversityillinoischampaignurbanaillinois", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. Thank you very much. Well, I was just sitting here thinking [CARDINAL] things. First, when the Vice President got really warmed up- [laughter]-I thought to myself, first, it will become slightly obvious to this audience that he and I come from a little further south in [GPE]. [Laughter] And then I was thinking, when he really got going, I wish I had people walking the aisles passing the plate. It was amazing. [Laughter] Anyway, the second thing I thought in the midst of this wonderful event was that I wish that I could take [ORG] with me for [DATE] or [CARDINAL] wherever I go. [Applause] Thank you. Audience members. We love you, [PERSON]! [SPEAKER]. Thank you. I want to say to Chancellor [PERSON] and President [PERSON] and Mayor [PERSON], Mayor [PERSON], Congressman [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], and Senator [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON], and Mr. Vice President, I am delighted to be here. I have spent a lot of time in [GPE] in [DATE], and this State has been very good to me in many ways. The Vice President has been here a lot, and [PERSON] came and got a honorary degree and was able to speak here. And I have heard from also our families, friends what a wonderful place this is. I do not know how, with all my roaming across [GPE], I have never lit down here before, but I am sure glad I got here [DATE]. And I thank you for making me feel so welcome. If you heard the State of the Union [TIME] or just listened to the Vice President here [DATE] you know that-you know there is a reason we are here, because you represent, both all of you individually and this great institution, what we are trying to build for the future of [GPE]. [TIME] I talked about all the changes that have occurred just in [DATE]. We have had [CARDINAL] foot in [DATE] for quite some time. The generation living [DATE] has lived through more changes in more different areas in a shorter time than virtually any generation in the history of this country. And when the Vice President and I took office, we were committed to trying to make [GPE] work again, to try to fix the things that just were not working for ordinary people, and then to free us up to sort of imagine the future and take the steps that were necessary to get us to the future we want to build. That is really what I talked about [TIME]: How can we strengthen this country for [DATE]? What do we have to do? Now, I do not want to go over everything that was said, and besides that, I cannot do as well as the Vice President. He must have gotten [TIME] sleep than I did [TIME]. [Laughter] He was terrific. But I want to talk to you about [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] things that I think we should be thinking about for [DATE]. Let me begin with a bit of history, and your chancellor mentioned it earlier, or [SPEAKER] did. Shortly before-shortly after [PERSON] was elected President, Congressman [PERSON], from [GPE], asked his colleagues to help him create a system of land grant colleges. It was in the middle of the Civil War, and frankly, most of them thought he was nuts. You know, people were worried about the survival of the [ORG]. But [PERSON] was always worrying about other things, even in the middle of the Civil War. At [TIME], when I work in [FAC], I go to an office that I have had restored to the way it was in [DATE]. And I remember that that room was [PERSON] waiting room during the Civil War. And all during the Civil War, at [TIME], he kept a time apart to meet with ordinary citizens. If you wanted a job in a post office in [GPE] in [DATE], if you came at [DATE], at [TIME], you could walk up to the room that I go into every night, and sit there, and [PERSON] would see you; [SPEAKER] would see you and listen to you tell why you wanted a post office job. And when he was asked why he did this, he said, I have to remember that people are concerned about other things, and I want this war to be over so all of us can go back to thinking about things like that. So he always thought about what life would be like when the war was over. And he was open to this. In [DATE], [PERSON]'s bill passed, and President [PERSON] signed it into law. It became one of the wisest investments our Nation ever made, and [ORG], here, was one of the original land grant colleges under that Morrill Act. It is played a dramatic role in helping to shape our Nation. You heard and you were cheering about all the Nobel Prize winners and all that. The Vice President pointed out that it was here that the transistor was invented; [PERSON], class of [DATE], co-invented the microchip. [ORG], headed by [PERSON], launched a [MONEY] browser industry. [GPE] and other land grant colleges have literally led our way into the information age. And it all stemmed from something somebody did in [DATE] that no one could have imagined would [DATE] have led to all you see around you. I think [PERSON] would have liked [ORG]. [Laughter] But he could not have imagined it. So that is what we have been trying to do. And you heard the Vice President say that basically our view was-the first thing we had to do was we had to get rid of the deficit, but we had to do it in a way that would enable us to invest in our future. We had to shrink the Government, but we had to do it in a way that would allow us to be more active in the areas that were important to our future, that would help to bring us together and widen the circle of opportunity. And the strategy is working. Now, as you look ahead, I'd just like to mention [CARDINAL] things [DATE] that I think the University can have a major impact on, [CARDINAL] directly and one indirectly. First, we should look to [DATE] to try to speed the pace of scientific and technological advances in ways that benefit all of us. So I proposed [TIME] a huge increase in medical research, an increase in [ORG], a doubling of [ORG], because I believe we have enormous opportunities there, and you should be a part of that. I think it is highly likely that many of you who will be having children in [DATE] will have children that will live into [DATE] because of the work that will be done in places like [ORG]. The second thing that I think we should think about is we should reaffirm our commitment to the exploration of outer space. I talked a little about the international space station [TIME] and about Senator [PERSON] at [DATE] going back into space. It is so thrilling, and I know all of you are happy about that. But we are learning a lot from our work in space about how our bodies work here on Earth and about how our environment works here on Earth and how it might be better preserved. And so I ask all of you to continue to support the work we are doing there. And finally, I'd ask you to support, as the Vice President said, this next generation Internet. I mean, can you really believe that [DATE] there were [CARDINAL] webpages on the Internet; that the Internet was the private preserve of physicists [DATE], and now, most [DATE] know more about it than their parents? [Laughter] I mean, that gives you some sense of the speed of change. So we are trying to develop the next generation Internet, and [PERSON] is helping us, and if it works, it will work [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] 000 times faster than the present one does. I do not know how we can absorb any more speed in information, but we have to be able to. We have to maintain public support across party lines and regional lines and age lines and race lines and all kinds of lines for investments in the future. We always have to be trying to shape the future, and we need your help to do that. Now, the second thing that I want to emphasize is that I want all of you to support the proposition that we have to make, in [DATE], a college education as universal as a high school education is [DATE]. Now, why do I say that? Already it is perfectly clear from looking at all the census figures that any young person who has at least 2 years of college or more is highly likely to get a job with growing income prospects and high stability and the prospect of positive change in the future. Now, a young person with [DATE] of college is highly likely to be in a job where income increases do not keep up with inflation, subject to changes which may be unstable and not positive. We have to create a network of lifetime learning. We have to, first of all, make our elementary and secondary education as excellent as our higher education is [DATE] so more people will be prepared to go to college. But then we literally-we have got to make sure that college is open to all. Now, as the Congressman said, [DATE] was [DATE] for education in [DATE], and I believe, clearly, [DATE] since the GI bill was passed. If you listen to all the things that were done-and I will just litanize them for you-I think you can make a compelling case that the doors of college have been opened to everybody who will work for it. Now, listen to this: [CARDINAL] new Pell grant scholarships and the maximum amount increased; [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] new work-study positions; [CARDINAL] [ORG] slots for people who do community service work and earn money to go to college. As Senator [PERSON] said, she cosponsored the bill to make interest on student loans tax deductible again; there are IRA's now that you can invest in and then withdraw from, tax-free, if the money is used for education. [DATE] of college, virtually all [NORP] are eligible for a [MONEY] tax cut to pay for tuition in [DATE] of college, the [ORG] scholarship; and then another tax credit for [DATE] of college, for graduate school, and for further job training-a lifetime learning credit. Now, this is an amazing thing. But what I want to say to you is, all of you who are here, I came here to ask, as a great university, in whatever service groups you are in, in whatever family or neighborhood or church networks you have, you need to get this message out to people who are coming on behind you. We need every child in this country to know that if he or she works hard and learns what they are supposed to learn, they can all go to college now. And we need them there for our future in [DATE]. Now, the last thing I want to ask your help on in [DATE], because we are going to have a big dialog about it, is something that all of you students probably never think about, and that is [ORG] and your retirement. I do not know about you, but when I was your age, I never thought about it. [Laughter] I thought I would live forever, always young. And what Senator [PERSON]-Braun said is true: The older you get, the faster time goes. I never will forget, once, [DATE], I saw a man who was [DATE] at an airport meeting his brother, getting ready to go to his sister's funeral. And I said, What are you thinking about? And he said, Oh, I am thinking about when we were [DATE], how we used to play together. He said, You know, [PERSON], it does not take long to live a life. I say that to say that even the young must care for the future, even the young must think about their obligations to generations yet unborn; that [GPE] must work as a seamless web of community, always doing what is best for [DATE] and [DATE]. Now, what is that got to do with [ORG]? There are polls that say that young people in [DATE] think it is more likely that they will see UFO's than that they will ever collect [ORG]. [Laughter] And all of you know that the [ORG] system is supposed to be in trouble. Now, what does that mean? It is not in trouble [DATE]; nobody [DATE] has got any problems drawing their money. In fact, [DATE] we collect more money in [ORG] taxes [DATE], quite a bit more, than we pay out. The problem is that when the baby boomers retire-starting with me, I am the oldest of the baby boomers-people my age and down about 18 years younger, we are the largest group of [NORP] that have ever lived, except the group that started first grade [DATE]-second grade, or third grade, whatever it is, something in grade school-because we have got more children in schools now, public schools, than we had during the baby boom generation for the first time. But we are going to have [DATE] where there will be a huge number of people on [ORG] in [DATE], compared to the people who are paying in. That is the issue. Now, the question is, what is the best way to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers in ways that do not either rob those people who need it of their secure retirement or impose intolerable burdens on our children, who, in turn, will be burdened in raising our grandchildren? I do not know anybody in my generation who believes that we ought to just take it out on you and put our feet up when we turn [DATE] and turn away from the obligations we have to contribute to the further growth and vitality of people who are younger than we are. So the question is, what is the fairest way to change this? What is best for people who are on [ORG] now? What is best for the baby boomers? What is best for young people in [DATE] [DATE] just starting to pay into the system? What is best for the kids that are in high school now who have not even started? We are going to spend [DATE] having forums all across the country, completely nonpartisan, trying to bring people in and debate it. And then [DATE], I am going to convene the leaders of [ORG], and we are going to try to craft historic bipartisan legislation to reform [ORG], to save it for [DATE], to make sure it is there not just for the baby boomers but for everybody in this audience and all your children, too, so we will have a system that works, so that people who work hard and do their part will know they will have elemental retirement security and that we can do it without bankrupting the country. I think we can do it. I know we can do it. But it is going to take your good-faith involvement-people of all ages. And since what we do may affect how you proceed throughout your entire worklife, we have got to have people involved in [DATE], in [DATE]. The young people of this country have got to be involved in this debate. It will affect you as much as anybody else. But if we do it, it will be just sort of like balancing the budget. You know how people said, Oh, you will never get that budget balanced. You will never do that. That is just something politicians talk about. It is a huge thing to do. Why? We spend less money on debt; we invest more money in our future; we have a stronger economy. The same thing will be true of [ORG]. Once we make the adjustments necessary to fix it, the increase in confidence, the increase in savings, the increase in belief in the future of this country as we go forward together will be absolutely astonishing. And we need you to be a part of it. The last thing I want to ask about-the Vice President touched this briefly, and he knows more about it than I do-but we need young people in this country, particularly young people in our university system, to convince the rest of [GPE] that we must and we can address the challenge of climate change and global warming. Now, I can tell you, I have been working on the economics of energy efficiencies for [DATE] now in various guises. I am convinced that the technology is out there right now to do what we need to do to do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in factories, in power generation systems, in homes and office buildings. And we are getting very, very close in automobiles. We can get there. But listen, this is your future; this is your life; this is the world your children and your grandchildren will have to live in, in [DATE]. This is crazy for us not to do this. We do not have to take the economy down; we will lift the economy up. And you have to take the lead in helping us meet this challenge. Scientific research, universal access to university education, reforming [ORG] for [DATE], dealing with the challenge of climate change: those are [CARDINAL] of the things that are out there. Keep your eyes on the future. Believe in this country. Believe in yourself. Reach out across the lines that divide us. Do not let people-do not ever let people who are divisive or pessimistic convince you that there is anything this country cannot do. I can look at you and tell you that this country can do anything we put our minds to. Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheussnimitzcommissioningceremonynorfolkvirginia", "text": "Thank you very much, Mr. [PERSON]. Distinguished Members of the [ORG], Secretary [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON], Captain [PERSON], Mrs. [PERSON], distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: At the outset, let me thank the Secretary of [ORG] for his more than generous comments, and let me simply reiterate the theme that he set forth. We are strong, we will continue to be strong, we will keep our commitments, and we will remain a great country. As each of us looks upon this great ship, a single thought must seize our minds: Only [GPE] can make a machine like this. There is nothing like her in the world [DATE]. We have witnessed the magic moment when an intricate mass of steel and cable and sophisticated marvels of engineering suddenly become a living thing with a unique personality. No matter how many commissionings you take part in, breaking the pennant and setting the first watch involves a special reward for all of us who love the sea and [ORG]. I thank you very much, Captain [PERSON], and all of the ship's company for the privilege of being here. The Nimitz is now a [GPE] Ship. I congratulate all who helped build her and all who man her, as well as their loved ones who-as many of you know better than I will do a lot of waiting for the sake of our country and of freedom everywhere. Their allegiance and their service to the country is also in the very best tradition of this great [ORG]. We all regret that Mrs. [PERSON], [GPE], cannot share [TIME] with all of us, but I am happy that Mrs. [PERSON] and other members of the admiral's family are here. It is also gratifying to have Admiral [PERSON] here, for without these [CARDINAL] farsighted submariners, Fleet Admiral [PERSON] and Admiral [PERSON], we would have no nuclear [ORG]. Few of us remember that it was Admiral [PERSON], as he was completing his career as Chief of Naval Operations in [DATE], who recommended to the then Secretary of the [ORG] that [ORG] and the new [ORG] get together to design and to build a nuclear propulsion plant for a submarine. Admiral [PERSON] took it from there. I see this great ship as a double symbol of [DATE]'s challenging times. She is first of all a symbol of [GPE], of our immense resources in materials and skilled manpower, of our inexhaustible energy, of the inventive and productive genius of our free, competitive economic system, and of our massive but controlled military strength. Wherever the United States Ship Nimitz shows her flag, she will be seen as we see her now, a solid symbol of [GPE] strength, [GPE] resolve made in [GPE] and manned by [NORP]. She is a movable part and parcel of our country, a self-contained city at sea plying the international waters of the world in defense of our national interests. Whether her mission is one of defense, diplomacy, or humanity, the Nimitz will command awe and admiration from some, caution and circumspection from others, and respect from all. There is no need for me to dwell on the importance of aircraft carriers in [DATE]'s and [DATE]'s defense planning though as an old carrier man myself, I might like that role. During [DATE], I think it is worthy to note, we have seen the most convincing demonstration of their readiness and their flexibility in the successful execution of national policy. Without the [CARDINAL] aircraft carriers which served as the nucleus of our forces operating off South Vietnam, without the skill and the heroic performance of [ORG] and naval aviation and support personnel, without the [ORG] helicopter crews who operated from the carrier decks, we could not have rescued all of the remaining [NORP] citizens and [CARDINAL] of endangered [NORP] from [GPE] within [TIME]. And I congratulate, on behalf of all of you, the work that was done on that occasion. The Nimitz joins the fleet at an auspicious moment when our determination to strengthen our tics with allies across both great oceans and to work for peace and stability around the world requires clear demonstration. Along with our other forces worldwide, the Nimitz will make critically important contributions in our continuing quest for a peaceful planet, a planet whose surface is [PERCENT] [PERCENT] ocean. As I see the United States Ship Nimitz as a symbol of the vast power, the protective or productive skill and economic strength of [GPE], so will others around the world. To all, this great ship is visible evidence of our commitment to friends and allies and our capability to maintain those commitments. But for [NORP], especially, she is also a symbol of the man whose name she bears. The grandson of a seafaring [NORP] immigrant, who grew up in the great State of [GPE] and never lost his pride in his native [GPE], [PERSON] started from the smoke of Pearl Harbor and carried the fight to the enemy. His superb leadership and the valor of [CARDINAL] [NORP] fighting men culminated on the deck of the [GPE] [GPE] [DATE], as he signed the [NORP] surrender as commander in chief of the largest naval armada ever assembled. Looking back on a period of my own life, one of the things of which I am the proudest is that I can say, I served under Admiral [PERSON] in the Pacific. As a lowly lieutenant on the [GPE] Monterey, a carrier you could probably stow on the hangar deck of the Nimitz, I saw very little of fleet admirals during World War II. But every watch officer could recognize the crisp CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific] dispatches that Admiral [PERSON] obviously had written in his own hand. [CARDINAL] biographer who did not know him or who, I should say, did know him Professor [PERSON] of [ORG], summed up Admiral [PERSON]' qualities in simple words that well serve as a model for anyone who aspires to leadership in any line of endeavor. And I quote from Professor [PERSON]: He surrounded himself with the ablest men he could find and sought their advice, but he made his own decisions. He was a keen strategist who never forgot that he was dealing with human beings, on both sides of the conflict. He was aggressive in war without hate, audacious while never failing to weigh the risks. Admiral [PERSON], of all the great [NORP] commanders of World War II, was one of the most self-effacing and, certainly, one of the most effective. He possessed great stamina, an abundance of common sense, and such immense inner strength that he felt no need to strut or to shout. Born near what [DATE] we would call the poverty level, he worked hard, he studied hard, and was a long, long time getting ahead. He spent his whole life training to serve his country in commanding men at sea, and when he was needed, he was prepared. He learned by his mistakes and was tolerant of others, but he was always in command. Those who had the good fortune to know Admiral [PERSON] will say his fundamental honesty, intellectual honesty and integrity, enabled him to keep a steady course toward his ultimate objective without yielding to the tremendous pressures of his vast responsibilities. He did the job he was prepared to do, did it superbly, hung up his sword and filled [DATE] with quiet service to his country and to the cause of peace. Repeatedly urged to write his wartime memoirs, Admiral [PERSON] just as repeatedly refused. To do so, he explained, would compel him either to hurt the reputations of some fine shipmates or tell some whopping lies. His own philosophy, in his own words, has long been a personal inspiration to me. Typically, he credited it to his seafaring grandfather. The sea, like life itself is a stern taskmaster, he recalled. The best way to get along with either is to learn all you can, then do your best, and do not worry especially about things over which you have no control. So, this great ship is a symbol of a great sea commander and a great [NORP], one whose common virtues magnified by the stern demands of duty turned defeat into victory and made the broad Pacific again worthy of its name. It is my determination to keep it that way, the way all oceans and all continents ought to be. But Fleet Admiral [PERSON] and this fine ship both tell us that controlled strength is the sure guarantor of peace. Let us all and particularly those who serve in [GPE] Ship Nimitz, now and hereafter-rededicate ourselves to this principle and to unstinting service to our country and to its people.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehousestrategysessionimprovinghispanicstudentachievement", "text": "Thank you very much, and good [TIME]. I have received a good report on what you have done so far, and I want to get right into our program, but I would like to make a few remarks first. I'd like to thank Governor [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON] and Congressman [PERSON] and [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON] for joining us, along with our other panel members. And I'd like to thank Congressman [PERSON], [PERSON] for being here. I think Congressman [PERSON] from [GPE] is on the way. And I want to welcome Mayor [PERSON] from [GPE], and especially Lieutenant Governor of [GPE] [PERSON], who is here. And I'd like to thank [PERSON] and [PERSON] from [ORG] for the work they have done on this, along with all the others who have worked so hard. This is very important to me. One of the things that I have learned traveling [GPE] is just how diverse [NORP] America is, something that a lot of [NORP] do not really know yet. I think there is a common core of values around family and community and work and faith, but [NORP] America is growing more diverse [DATE] with different challenges and, unfortunately, still different opportunities. There are still a lot of gaps that we all want to close. Most of them are narrowing, but we have still got a lot of work to do. [DATE] the First Lady hosted the firstever [ORG]. And [DATE] we are following up on that Conference by setting forth specific goals and an agenda for closing the student achievement gap over [DATE] in ways that we can all be held accountable for. The first step to closing that gap is to believe, as I do, that high expectations are for all students. I believe intelligence is equally distributed throughout the world, but opportunity is not. And the same is true within our own country. For [DATE] now, we have pushed hard for higher standards, for more choice, for greater accountability, and for more support for children and teachers and parents and schools who need it. We have hired [CARDINAL], 000 new, highly trained teachers now, on the way to our goal of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] more teachers to lower class sizes in the early grades. We have connected [CARDINAL] of our classrooms to the Internet; that is up from [PERCENT] in [DATE], when we started in northern [GPE], the Vice President and I did, with our first NetDay. We have made it possible for [PERCENT] of our schools in very low income areas to have [CARDINAL] Internet connection because of the E-rate program that the Vice President and I fought very hard for in the Telecommunications Act in [DATE]. And we have more than doubled college aid in [DATE], the biggest expansion since the GI bill [DATE]. In all these areas, I actually believe we have more to do. We also, as all of you know, put in place a Hispanic Education Action Plan that includes, [DATE], a [MONEY] increase for programs to improve [NORP] student outcomes. And I want to double that investment. This strategy of investing more and demanding more is working. Test scores are up across the country; more students than ever are going to college. If we just keep it up, we will really take this country and all its children where we want to go. Unfortunately, that progress is threatened by the education bill that [ORG] passed [DATE] or that the [ORG] passed [DATE]. I think it demands too little accountability, and I know it puts in too few resources. It, in my judgment, underinvests in everything from after-school programs, which we have taken from [MONEY] to [MONEY] in [DATE]. And if that bill were to come to my desk, I would have to veto it. But I hope we can work with [ORG] on a bipartisan education bill. We have had some success in [DATE], and I am confident we will [DATE]. I'd like to talk [TIME] about what many of you already know, which is that [NORP] students are sharing in this academic success, but still too many are lagging behind in ways that I find deeply troubling. [DATE] I am releasing a study by [ORG], which shows that the average educational level of native-born [NORP] has increased substantially over [DATE], and the gap between [NORP] and whites has declined. Compared to [DATE], [NORP] students are scoring higher on math tests; greater percentages are completing high school, graduating from college, and getting advanced degrees. However, there is some bad news in this report, because the need for education is growing even faster. For example, since [DATE], the percentage of [NORP] with [DATE] of college has increased but only by [PERCENT]. Over [DATE], the number of jobs requiring [DATE] of college will more than double. The study shows that [NORP], who represent [PERCENT] of our work force, hold down [PERCENT] of the jobs in information technology, jobs that pay much more than average in the area where jobs are growing most rapidly. Every [NORP] should be concerned about that gap. When the fastest growing demographic group in our country is underrepresented in the fastest growing employment sector, it means less opportunity and a violation of the values that we all share. It also means that, sooner or later, our economy will have a shortage of highly skilled workers where we really need them. [CARDINAL] other finding in the report bears mentioning because it will inform the debate we are going to have [DATE]. The problem is not that [NORP] are not choosing careers in key industries like information technology. In fact, according to the report, [NORP] who graduate from college enter the information technology industry at about the same rate as [NORP] and earn about as much. The problem, therefore, quite simply, is that not enough [NORP] are getting college degrees. That can be remedied only by raising the educational achievements of [NORP] students in schools, beginning in preschool years, continuing into adulthood, and by making sure that no person is ever denied access to college because of cost. We know that the achievement levels can be raised. The question is whether we have the will to do what we know works. If we are going to set high expectations of students, we must have high expectations of ourselves to do what it takes to make sure all of our students can make the grade. We know that we can make college more accessible. That is what the [ORG] scholarships do, [ORG], the lifetime learning tax credit. But I think we ought to do more. I have got a proposal before [ORG] to give up to $10, [MONEY] of tuition tax-deductible status [DATE] and to do it at a [PERCENT] income tax rate, even for people in the [PERCENT] income tax bracket, which is a very, very important proposal. And it could make it possible for even more of our young people to go to college and for more of our families to afford it. So [DATE], we know what we have to do, and we know we can do it. And what I think is always helpful is to translate what we wish to do into specific goals. So I think we ought to adopt [CARDINAL] specific goals to close the [NORP] student achievement gap over [DATE]. First, let us make sure that in [DATE], young [NORP] children are enrolled in quality early childhood programs at the same rate as other [NORP]. Second, let us make sure that in [DATE], every [NORP] student graduating from high school will have demonstrable proficiency in English. Third, let us make sure that in [DATE], there is no gap in test scores and other assessments between [NORP] students and their peers. Fourth, let us make sure in [DATE], [PERCENT] of [NORP] students complete high school. And fifth, let us make sure that over [DATE], the percentage of [NORP] students who earn college degrees will double what it is [DATE]. Now, these goals are specific and ambitious but clearly achievable. If we are serious, we have to do something about meeting them. [TIME] the Secretary of Education released the first of what will be [DATE] reports measuring progress in [NORP] student achievement. We also need an entity outside electoral politics to keep a national spotlight on these goals, because they should be the [ORG]'s goals, without regard to party. [DATE] I am happy to announce the creation of such an entity: [ORG], a partnership among a wide variety of [NORP] organizations, including [ORG] and [ORG], and corporate and non-profit groups, from the [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG] to [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG]. The alliance will be, as they say, in your face. [Laughter] It is designed to remind the [ORG] of these goals and to spur commitments, specific ones, at every level of government and the private sector to help to meet them. I am happy that a number of organizations have already committed to taking specific steps to help achieve the goals. [ORG] will publicize the goals in public service announcements to run on its [ORG]. The educational software firm [ORG] is teaming up with [ORG] to provide special software and Internet access for computers in [ORG] neighborhood centers in [NORP] communities. Many other organizations, from [ORG] to [ORG], also are contributing. Closing this achievement gap is a challenge that may seem daunting now, but it will seem inevitable once we do it. And when we do it, if we work hard, stay together, and stay focused on the goal, [GPE] will be a better, stronger place in [DATE]. Thank you very much. I'd like now to introduce Governor [PERSON] of [GPE], who increased his State's investment in education by [MONEY] and doubled funds to build and modernize schools in [DATE] in office. In more ways than I can count right now, since he is been Governor, [GPE] has been on the forefront of change in our Nation. And I wish every State would follow [GPE]'s lead.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstownhallmeetingandquestionandanswersessionlosangelescalifornia", "text": "AboutSearch [SPEAKER]. Thank you so much. It is good to be here. It is good to be here. Although I was hoping that the Governor was going to take a little longer on his remarks, because I was standing outside soaking in some rays. Nothing like [GPE] weather. I am greatly honored to be joined here by one of the great innovators of State government, somebody who has been leading [GPE] through some very difficult times, and somebody who has turned out to be just an outstanding partner with our administration. I am grateful for him; I am grateful for the first lady of [GPE]. Please give it up for [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Thank you. Another outstanding public official, somebody who is fighting [DATE] on behalf of the working people of [GPE] and has a vision for the future for this great city, please give a huge round of applause to your mayor, [PERSON]. Somebody who is always been ahead of his time and has covered the waterfront in public service and has excelled in each thing that he is done, please, a big round of applause for your attorney general, [PERSON]. Some other friends who are here, [ORG] Auditor [PERSON] where is [PERSON]? Right here. Speaker of the [ORG], a great supporter of [PERSON] from the start, [PERSON]; [ORG] President pro tem [PERSON] is here. State Senator [PERSON] is here. Assemblyman [PERSON] is here. Your [CARDINAL] wonderful [GPE] Senators are not here, but I want you to applaud them anyway, because they work for us each and every day, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Congresswoman [PERSON] is not here, but she is your Congresswoman, so give her a big round of applause. And last person I want to mention well, [CARDINAL] other people I want to mention I believe that my Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], is here in the house. I also want to make this point. We are in a facility named after [CARDINAL] of the finest labor leaders in this region's history and in this country's history, [PERSON]. And [PERSON]'s widow is a great friend of mine, a great supporter, a great labor leader in her own right. Please give it up for [PERSON]. [PERSON] was one of our earliest supporters at a time when nobody gave us a chance. She said, Si se puede. We could do it. And we are grateful to her. Thank you so much. It is always nice to get out of [GPE] at least for a little bit and to come to places like this. The climate is nicer. So is the conversation sometimes. So I am looking forward to taking your questions and hearing about your concerns. And I look forward to telling you about the work my administration is doing to address some of those concerns. But the [CARDINAL] thing I do not need to tell you is that these are challenging times. I do not need to tell you this because you are living it [DATE]. [DATE] and [DATE], this State lost [CARDINAL] jobs; [CARDINAL] out of every [CARDINAL] [NORP] is now out of work. Housing prices here have fallen [PERCENT] in [DATE], and you have got one of the highest foreclosure rates in the Nation. So your public servants are working double overtime to address these critical issues. And I know how tough times are in [GPE], in [GPE], but also all across the country. Here is what I want you to remember, though: We are going to meet these challenges; we will come out on the other side stronger and a more prosperous nation. That I can guarantee you. I cannot tell you how long it will take, what obstacles we will face along the way, but I promise you this: There will be brighter days ahead. Because of the Recovery Act that I signed into law [DATE] and that your [CARDINAL] outstanding Senators, [PERSON] and [PERSON], worked so hard to pass we are making major investments to create jobs right here in [GPE] rebuilding infrastructure, weatherizing homes, and putting more police on the streets, supporting community health centers. Altogether, we expect to create or save [CARDINAL], 000 jobs in this State over [DATE]. But we also know that we cannot create as many jobs as we want or rebuild our economy the way we hope without addressing the problem at the heart of this economic crisis, and that is our housing crisis. We know that fixing that crisis, breaking that cycle of falling home values and rising foreclosures, is one of the keys to fixing our economy. And that is why we have launched a housing plan that will help [CARDINAL] of responsible homeowners save money by refinancing or modifying their mortgages. Our plan included important steps to help lower interest rates. And [DATE], [CARDINAL] of [NORP], people who never thought they'd be able to lower their [DATE] payments, are now able to take advantage of these rates, which are the lowest that they have been in [DATE]. Already, we are seeing a burst of refinancing. Refinancing applications jumped [PERCENT] [DATE] to more than double the rate we had [DATE], saving the average homeowner [MONEY] a month, the equivalent of a generous tax cut. That is money in their pocket, money you can use right now to pay your bills or pay off your debts or save up for a rainy day, to save for retirement or that college education for your child. And [DATE] we launched a new web site called makinghomeaffordable.gov, to help borrowers determine whether they are eligible for our plan and to help them calculate how much money the plan could save them on their mortgage, on their [DATE] payments. And keep in mind, this is in addition to the [MONEY] [MONEY] tax credit for first-time homebuyers that is in our recovery plan. And if you buy your home your first home any time between now and [DATE], you can claim that credit [DATE], on your [DATE] tax return, and receive that money in [DATE]. So if you have not filed your taxes yet, but you are thinking about buying a house you can request a [DATE] extension until [DATE] and claim the credit before then. Or if you have already filed your taxes or you wish to do so before [DATE], you can just amend your form [DATE] after you have bought your home and get your money then. Look, the idea here is very simple: If you buy a home [DATE], you should be able to get your tax credit [DATE]. That is when you need it most. That is how we will help people start spending again. That is how we will help raise home values, stabilize our housing market, create new jobs again. That is our plan. That is what we are going to do right here in [GPE]. Now, I am also pleased to announce that [DATE] [GPE] will be receiving [MONEY] from [ORG] to provide additional help to communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. So these funds will be used to buy up and rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed homes and resell those homes with affordable mortgages and to provide mortgage assistance and rehabilitation loans for low-income and middle-income families. That is how we will help people here in [GPE] live their dream of homeownership and how we will start transforming abandoned streets lined with empty houses back into thriving neighborhoods. Now, we know that it is not enough to address challenges like housing and infrastructure and job creation just in the short term. None of this will make a difference unless we build an economy that offers prosperity in the long run. We cannot go back to a bubble-and-burst economy based on reckless speculation and spending beyond our means, where a relative few do spectacularly well while the middle class loses ground. We cannot go back to a culture on Wall Street that says it is okay to bend or break the rules and a culture in [GPE] that says it is okay to look the other way. We cannot go back to that. We cannot allow what happened at [ORG] to ever happen again in this country. I know a lot of people are outraged about this; I am outraged too. The idea that some of the very people who drove our economy into the ground could accept bonuses with [CARDINAL] hand while they are taking taxpayer money with the other goes against our most basic sense of what is fair and what is right. I am committed, as President, to ensuring that we have the tools to prevent the kinds of abuses that sent [ORG] spiraling in the first place, so we never again put our financial system at that kind of risk, and we are not held hostage by companies that are, quote, unquote, too big to fail. We also want to do this because it serves the most important goal we have [DATE], which is to rebuild our economy in a way that is consistent with our values, an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility, not high-flying financial schemes; an economy that is built on a strong foundation, not one that is propelled by an overheated housing market or everybody maxing out on their credit cards. We need to bring about a recovery that endures. You remember remember that ad where it used to say, We earn money the old-fashioned way; we earn it. Right? We make money the old-fashioned way; we earn it. That is what we have to do. We have to get back to the principle of hard work and innovation and dedication. And that is exactly the purpose of the budget I am submitting to [ORG]. It is a budget that makes hard choices about where to save and where to spend. Because of the massive deficit we inherited and the cost of this financial crisis, we are going through our books, line by line, so that we can cut our deficit in [CARDINAL] by [DATE] and reduce it by [MONEY] over [DATE]. Now, I know that the Governor is having to make these same tough choices. There are going to be initiatives here that talk about the need for everybody to chip in, everybody to give a little something up in order to get our fiscal house in order. We are going to have to do that same thing at the Federal level. Mayor [PERSON] has got to do the same thing with respect to city budgets. These are tough times. What we will not do, though, is cut investments that will lead to real growth and real prosperity over the long term, investments that will make a difference in the lives of this generation and future generations. So because we know that spiraling health care costs are crushing families and dragging down the entire economy, and because we know it represents one of the fastest growing parts of our budget, we have made a historic commitment to health care reform in this budget, reform that brings us closer to [DATE] when health care is affordable and accessible for every single [NORP]. That is something we have got to shoot for. It is time. It is time. It is time. We know and we have got [CARDINAL] principals right here in the front row we know that we know and they know that countries that out-educate us [DATE] will outcompete us [DATE]. And that is why my budget invests in a complete and competitive education for every [NORP], in early childhood education programs that work, in high standards and accountability for our schools, in finally putting the dream of a college degree or technical training within reach for anybody who wants it. Because we know that enhancing [GPE]'s competitiveness will require reducing our dependence on foreign oil and building a clean energy economy, this budget will spark the transformation we need to create green jobs and launch renewable energy companies right here in [GPE]. It makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy and invests in technologies like wind power and solar power and fuel-efficient cars and trucks and high-speed rail powered by batteries like the one I saw in [GPE] [TIME] all of which will help us combat climate change. That is got to be a priority. That is what this budget does. Now, here is what this budget does not do. It does not raise taxes on any family making [MONEY], 000 a year, by [MONEY]. In fact, [PERCENT] of all working families will receive a tax cut as a result of our recovery plan. Now, there are those who say these plans are too ambitious, that anything we should be trying to do is just focused on the banking crisis, that we should be trying to do less not more. In fact, somebody was saying the other [DATE], I think, that I should not be on [PERSON]. I cannot handle that and the economy at the same time. Listen, here is what I say. I say our challenges are too big to ignore. The cost of our health care is too high to ignore. Our dependence on oil is too dangerous to ignore. Our education deficit is too wide to ignore. To kick these problems down the road for [DATE] or [DATE], that would be to continue the same irresponsibility that led us to this point in the first place. And I did not run for President to pass on our problems to the next generation. I ran for President to solve these problems for the next generation and for the next President. So I that is what you want. I know some folks on [GPE] and on Wall Street are saying we should just focus on their problems, and I understand the thinking behind that. It would be nice if I could just pick and choose what problems to face, when to face them. So I could say, well, no, I do not want to deal with war in [GPE] right now, and I'd prefer not having to deal with climate change right now. And if you could just hold on even though you do not have health care, just please wait, because I have got other things to do. But that is not how things work. That is not how it works for you. You do not get to choose between paying your mortgage bills or your medical bills. You do not get to choose between paying your kids' tuition and saving enough for retirement. You have got to take all those problems on at the same time, and you need a government that will do the same. That is what leadership is about; that is what the debate on this budget is all about about whether we are willing to do what it needs to be done to get our economy moving and put people back to work and put us on the road to shared and lasting priorities. That is what I am going to do. That is what I am going to focus on. We are going to get it done with your help. I need you all. Okay. All right. This is the fun part of the program. Everybody have a seat. This is the fun part of the program. Now, first of all, we have not prescreened anybody. So if you do not like me, go ahead and just say, you know, You are a bum. That is okay. Hold on, hold on [TIME]. Just hold on. Just a couple of rules. First of all, we are going to go girl, boy, girl, boy. I am not going to be able to get to every question, so, people, raise your hands. I will try to get as many as possible; we will try to go around the room. There are people with microphones in the audience this young lady, for example an example. So wait until she gets there so everybody can hear your question. And the only other thing is, since we have a lot of people and not that much time, if everybody could try to keep their question relatively short that will be helpful. Okay? And stand when I have called on you. You do not need to stand before I have called on you, but stand when I have called on you. Q. My name is [PERSON]. [SPEAKER]. Hey, [PERSON]. Q. Hi. First, I want to say I am very glad and thankful that you are our President. And [DATE] I told my friend [PERSON] that [PERSON] will be President, and he said, no, not in my lifetime there will not be a black President. And I said, Just wait [DATE]. And when you won I said, I told you so. [SPEAKER]. See there. Always satisfying to say, I told you so. Q. And he was very happy. But he was very happy for me to tell him so. [SPEAKER]. Good. Q. So my question is, you talk about health care, which usually means insurance after you are sick. What about making our lifestyle healthier? Like we have corn syrup, we have trans fats, in all that food those things are illegal in Europe. And I know people that go to Europe and they overeat, but they lose weight because our their foods do not have all the hormones and the additives. And also, you know that [PERSON] put legislation into that limited the dumping of mercury into the rivers, and then you-know-who came into office and took that legislation away, and now the [SPEAKER]. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Q. are out of control. [SPEAKER]. Okay. Let me answer your first question. Q. Are you going to put that legislation [SPEAKER]. Okay. First of all, if you burn that many calories asking a question you know, I mean, she is fired up. So you will be able to eat whatever you want. Q. No, not trans fats [SPEAKER]. Anyway, all right, let me answer your question. And that did you just hit hand the mike to somebody else. This is actually a serious question. You are exactly right that if we are going to reform our health care system, what we cannot do is simply add more people to a hugely inefficient system that is costing us more and more each and every year, because eventually it will bankrupt families, it will bankrupt State governments, and it will bankrupt the country. So the only way that we can initiate true health care reform is if we control costs. And one of the most important ways for us to control costs is to deal with the issue of prevention, which means making sure that we have proper nutrition programs in our schools, making sure that we have got effective physical education programs for our children. It means making sure that everybody has access to a primary care doctor and that they are getting regular checkups, that we are avoiding preventable diseases like diabetes that are helping to shoot our medical costs through the roof. So that is going to be a huge component of whatever health care reform package that I sign, is a major push towards prevention. There is some other areas where we can do some important cost savings as well. Information technology the Recovery Act provides [MONEY] just putting our medical records online so . Okay, hold on [TIME]. If we have got a replacement mike that would be helpful, because this one's going in and out a little bit. You got one? Well, no, but you need that for your guys. There we go. Let us okay, that is good. But these if everybody's data medical data is in digital form with important privacy protections, we can reduce medical errors, we can make sure that doctors and nurses, pharmacists are all communicating more effectively. We will have, actually, better quality in hospitals, and we will also be driving down costs. So there are a whole host of measures that we put down payments on, on the recovery package, but we have got to get our budget passed in order to actually make it happen. [CARDINAL] last point I will make; something that has not been getting a lot of attention. We signed a renewal of [ORG] that added [CARDINAL] of children, including children of legal immigrants, into the mix. That is an important tool to prevent long-term diseases that can cost us a lot of money. All right, the gentleman right here. The gentleman right here with the beard. Q. No, I am unable to stand up. I believe that I am entitled to an exception of that rule under the [ORG]. Event staff member. Oh, I am so sorry. Q. I forgive you. [SPEAKER]. Go ahead. Q. Okay. [SPEAKER]. Introduce yourself. Q. I am [PERSON], and [SPEAKER], thank God for you. Sir, my question regards the true renaissance that is happening with people with disabilities. They are an emerging population, [CARDINAL] of people with more potential in capacity, more mobile, more educated, more healthy, more empowered technology, but still trapped in very, very old social models that see them in terms of tragedy and charity and need and care. And the modern population of people with disabilities simply does not fit that model. And as your plan succeeds and you generate these jobs, and as baby boomers retire, we are going to need every single person of capacity to work that we can. And that must include many, many, many thousands, if not [CARDINAL], of people with disabilities. So I see you nodding your head, so my first question is, do you subscribe to what I am saying, and next of all, can you talk about how your disability agenda will release this emerging potential that is currently wasted and untapped? [SPEAKER]. Well, you are exactly right, that we need everybody. And every program that we have has to be thinking on the front end, how do we make sure that it is inclusive and building into it our ability to draw on the capacities of persons with disabilities. That is true on the education front where our recovery package increases funding for children with disabilities. It is true in terms of how [PERSON], our Secretary of [ORG], will be thinking about our training programs, to make sure that we are not excluding from training for high-tech jobs the new jobs of the future persons with disability. It means enforcing the ADA and fighting back on some of court opinions that have tried to narrow, in ways that I think are inappropriate, the original intent of that legislation. So one of the things that I think is important is to make sure, as you pointed out, that we do not see this as an afterthought, a segregated program, but we are infusing every department, every agency, every act that we take with a mindfulness about the importance of persons with disabilities, their skills, their talents, their capacity. That I think is the approach that my administration is going to take, and we hope that by taking that approach that attitude will infuse State and local governments that are also receiving [ORG] money. Okay? This young lady right here has had her hand up for a while. Q. Hello, [SPEAKER] [SPEAKER]. Do not worry, I am going to get around. Hold on [TIME], I am going around. Go ahead. Q. Hello. [SPEAKER]. Hi. Q. My name is [PERSON]. [SPEAKER]. Hey, [PERSON]. Q. And first of all, I would just like to say, as a mixed-race individual, it is so fantastic to finally have a role model and a leader that I can actually identify with, so thank you. [SPEAKER]. Well, that is nice. Thank you. Q. They are have not been a whole lot, growing up. So, okay, so my question is specific to [GPE]. As you know, we have one of the highest costs of living in the [GPE] here. A household income that is considered middle or upper class in any other [GPE] would not go very far here. However, the tax laws and the recent economic stimulus address household income on a national level and do not take into account the cost of living by State, as far as I know. [GPE] now has, as you mentioned before, a higher unemployment rate than the national average; we make up [CARDINAL] of Nation's foreclosures. So what I want to know is, what can be done to address [GPE]'s unique and unique situation and stimulate the economy here in [GPE], and like you mentioned, just be prosperous into the future, keeping in mind, again, household incomes. And we are not really apples-to-apples with other [GPE], but we are taxed as if we are. [SPEAKER]. Well, look, I mean, obviously, there is differentiation between [GPE] both in terms of cost of living, but also in terms of salaries. And generally, those are taken into account through the deductions that are available through the Tax Code. I would say that the biggest problem, though, is probably not in our Tax Code is not the difference between how [NORP] are treated and people in [GPE] are treated. The bigger difference actually has to do with how people inside [GPE] are treated by the Tax Code. So if you are a multimillionaire who get most of your income from dividends and capital gains, then you are typically paying [PERCENT] of your income in taxes at the Federal level. But if you are a secretary making $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year in wages, then you are paying a higher rate. Now, so the secretary is paying a higher rate than [PERSON] as a percentage of their income. That is the inequity that I think is most destructive, because what it is done is, over [DATE] the average working family has seen their median income flatline; their wages and income have not gone up. On the other hand, people who were at the very top of the income scale, and I am now included in that category, we have seen all the benefits of economic growth when things were going well. And I actually think that contributes to a cycle of bubble and bust. And if we have a situation in which middle class people are earning a decent living, where we have got bottom-up economic growth, then I think that is good for everybody. I think ultimately that is good for businesses. I think it is good for rich folks, because when the economy rises, everybody does well. And you do not get as many distortions as you have gotten in this sort of bubble-and-bust cycle that we have had. Now, there are some things in [GPE] that we are doing that focus on particular needs here. We just talked Governor [PERSON] and Mayor [PERSON] here in [GPE], for example, there is an enormous opportunity to deal with traffic and transit and transportation in a way that will relieve congestion, make this economy more efficient, more productive. But the needs of [GPE] in terms of transportation dollars are going to be different from the needs of somebody in a predominantly rural [GPE]. And one of the things that we want to do in terms of how transportation dollars flow is to start emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of people live in suburbs or in cities in metropolitan regions, and how can we do a better job in planning and coordinating regionally so that you are not in your car for [TIME] a day. There are things that we can do that end up being specific to the situation of the economy in [GPE], but generally, [GPE] oftentimes gets hit worse when recessions come, but you also rise up faster when the economy starts to recover. So I am confident [GPE] will continue to be on the cutting edge of our economy. All right, it is a guy's turn, so ladies, put your hands down. It is a guy's turn. This gentleman right here, right here. Q. [SPEAKER], I really do not have a question, but I'd like to offer up to you a young lady by the name of [PERSON] who hosted you in [GPE] as possibly your domestic policy adviser for children and families. [SPEAKER]. Oh, okay. All right. Q. And my name is [PERSON]. [SPEAKER]. Okay, [PERSON]. All right, well, we will does she know that you were just doing that? Q. No. Oh, no. [SPEAKER]. That is a shame. She is going to be all embarrassed. All right, since that was not really a question, I am going to call on another guy. Gentleman back there in the cap, right there. Let us get a microphone. Right there. [ORG] Q. Thank you. [SPEAKER]. What is your name? Q. My name is [PERSON]. I immigrated here from [GPE], and [DATE], I was very excited when you had that wonderful reception in [GPE]. Now, former Vice President [PERSON] used to say deficits do not matter. But since you inherited his mess, the national debt has been growing and growing and no ending in sight. I am very happy you are in [ORG], but for the first time I am worried about this country, the stability and the future. My question: How is there a chance that we may follow in the footsteps of [GPE] and [DATE] just simply be broke? That is the question. [SPEAKER]. No. Q. Thank you. [SPEAKER]. No. But, you know, there is a chance that we leave such a mountain of debt to the next generation that it makes them poor over the long term, because we are having to borrow from foreign countries, make interest payments to other countries, and that over time standards of living here are lower than they should be relative to other countries. So we have got to get control of our deficit. Now, you are right, I inherited a [MONEY] deficit. And we saw the national debt double during the previous administration, which is why when I hear generally, I am a I try to be a bipartisan guy, but when I hear some folks from the other party in [ORG] start howling about the deficits, I am starting to think, well, where have you been? What have you been doing? I mean, you would've thought a good time to do something about deficits was when the economy was going good, right? You would have thought that is when you would have been saving away a little bit. If you had inherited a surplus, you would have thought that maybe, you know, we will maintain that. So I do not put much stock in some of those political attacks. But what is true is that the path we are on right now is unsustainable. So here is what we have to do. Our most immediate and urgent task is to put people back to work and get the economy rolling again. That is the thing we have to do right now. And that means that for [DATE], we are going to have to tolerate much higher deficits than I am comfortable with, not just for the recovery package, but the money that we have had to put in to deal with the financial crisis. The fact that people are out of work means they are needing unemployment insurance, they need additional there are greater needs for food stamps. All sorts of pressures and strains are placed on [ORG] government and local governments during a deep recession like this one. So we have got to suffer some big deficits while we move into recovery. The worst thing we could do is not worry about recovery, slash government spending at the same time as businesses are slashing their spending and consumers are slashing their spending. That creates a downward spiral that could make things even worse. But as soon as we start seeing a recovery and my hope is, is that over [DATE], we will have started moving again, building back up then what we have to do is build in a pathway for reducing our deficits. We have already, in this budget, slated that in [DATE] we are going to reduce nondiscretionary nondefense discretionary spending. Everything other than defense spending and entitlements like [ORG] and [ORG], we are going to reduce those to the lowest level relative to GDP of any time since [DATE]. I have also said that we are going to end the Iraq war, which is going to save us money during that period of time. We are going to have to reform [ORG], and that is part of the overall health care reform that we were talking about earlier. If we can get control of health care costs as a whole, then we can start bending the curve of costs for [ORG] and [ORG]. So we are already making some tough choices, reducing the deficit by [MONEY], but we are going to have to do more. And the biggest thing we are going to have to do is take on [ORG] and [ORG] health care costs. That is going to be the most important thing that we can do over the long term. All right. Okay. It is a woman's turn. This young lady back there, go ahead. Education Reform at the Local Level Q. Hello, [SPEAKER], my name is [PERSON]. And this question is on behalf of my sister, who is a public school teacher for [ORG], and on behalf of all the children, which is [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] children the second-largest school district in the Nation we need help. Even with the best leadership that we have currently with the district, with [ORG] President [PERSON] and the new superintendent, [PERSON], you know, we do not the [ORG] does not have the money, and we are having to lay off [CARDINAL] of teachers, you know, it is scary for our children. You know, even with the stimulus packet, in [DATE], I think, we are going to be in a deficit of [MONEY]. Where are we going to get that money? [SPEAKER]. Well, this is why before we came on, the Governor and I were talking. And the fact is, is that we are massively ramping up education spending at the Federal level, on a whole variety of fronts. But historically most education funding is done at the [ORG] level, at the local level. So we may be able to take education funding at the [ORG] level from [PERCENT] to [PERCENT], for example, but the lion's share is still going to be coming locally. And that is why it is so important for everybody to be engaged in the various initiatives that are going to be coming up, to make sure that what you just articulated, the need to invest in our kids, that that is reflected in terms of [ORG] budgets. Now, [CARDINAL] thing I have got to say, though and I think I speak for every public official here you cannot have something for nothing. You cannot have something for nothing. I was in [ORG], and we had done this event when we signed stem cell research, and a woman who was in the audience, she came up to me and she shook my hand and she said, Oh, President [PERSON], I am very excited, but you just had this health care forum please, please, I hope your plan is free health care for all. And I said, Listen, nothing is free. Nothing is free. So the reason I make that point is you cannot ask local elected officials to raise teachers' salaries and cut taxes and balance the budget and increase roads. At some point you have got to make some choices. So if you want a high quality education and [GPE] historically had the best education system in the country then somebody has got to pay for it. Now, the obligation of local officials and this is the same is true on [ORG] our obligation is to make sure that every dime of money is being spent wisely, every dime of money is being spent wisely. And when it comes to education and I am speaking to teachers here and educators let me say this I want to do some truth-telling here. Uh-oh. I love teachers. There is no profession that is more important than teaching. My sister is a teacher, but and I am a huge supporter of the teachers' unions. They were some of my first supporters. But let me tell you, you cannot just be talking more money, more money, without also talking about how are we going to reform and make the system better. There is got to be a reform agenda in exchange for the money. There is got to be a reform agenda in exchange for the money. So do not just say, give us more money or smaller classrooms, but you are not willing to consider, for example, how are we going to do better assessments. Or how are going to work to improve teacher performance, and if a teacher is not improving, how do we get them to choose a different career, right? I mean, there is got to be some serious conversation about that. Now, before I get off the topic of the education, let me do a little more truth-telling. Parents, you cannot complain about the schools and complain about the teachers, but when your child comes home, they are playing video games and not doing homework, and you do not have time to go to your teacher and parent teacher-parent meeting. Our parents have to instill a sense of excellence and a thirst for knowledge. And the truth of the matter is, even as overcrowded as schools may be, as poor the computer equipment may be, if you took a bunch of kids right now from [GPE] or [GPE] and you put them in these classrooms, from their perspective these would be unbelievable schools. I mean, they do not have better facilities, but they are out-performing us in math and science. Why is that? Well, part of it is, is that we as parents are not insisting and demanding on the kind of higher performance from our kids. So everybody has got to be more accountable in order to improve our education system. All right. It is a man's turn. I am going to turn back here this guy in the green shirt, right here. Everybody likes you, man. What, is he on like Gossip Girl or something? I do not I did not recognize him, but maybe he is is he a movie star? Who is got a mike? Go ahead. [PERSON] Q. Not a movie star, just [CARDINAL] of your volunteers. [SPEAKER]. There you go. Q. And they are all around here. And in my book, that is even more powerful. I guess that is the fundamental question I have is, there is such a passion in this country, and you inspired such a passion for us to do things that we never had before in the name of volunteerism, in the name of making you become our President like and thank you to everyone that was involved with that. My question is, clearly this is not something you can do alone in terms of changing our country. How can we best partner with you, how can we be most effective, moving forward, to change this country? [SPEAKER]. Well, the first thing, I think, is patience. No, I am serious about this, because, look, there was a lot of excitement during the campaign, and we were talking about the importance of bringing about change. We are moving systematically to bring about change. But change is hard. Change does not happen [TIME]. And the change we bring has to be matched by a sense of responsibility, because if you try to just change things [TIME] and you have not thought everything through, you could have some real problems. So for example, I closed [FAC]. That was the right thing to do. But I made the but in making that decision I said we are going to take [DATE] to figure out how are we going to deal with the folks who are detained there, some of whom really are dangerous folks, who if we just release them could do us harm. I believe that we are going to be able to effectively balance our national security needs with our civil liberties concerns, but it is not something that happens [TIME]. We have got to do it systematically. On the economy, this financial crisis that we have had is the largest since the Great Depression. I understand how mad everybody is about this [ORG] bonus business. I understand that. As I said before, I am mad. And even though I did not draw up these [ORG] contracts, [ORG] did not it is my responsibility to fix the system. But fixing the system requires us understanding that if banks are not solvent, if they are not lending, then businesses are not going to be able to invest; we are not going to be able to create jobs. And we can be as mad as we want, but the fact of the matter is, we have got to work through this huge mess that was made in the financial system. It is going to cost some money. It is not going to be pretty; people are going to be frustrated. And we are going to get it done. So on a whole range of these fronts, the first thing we need from the [NORP] people is a sense that we are going to get it done, but it is going to take a little bit of time. The second thing is keep paying attention to the debates that are taking place right now, so when we have a big budget debate I want everybody who was paying so much attention during the election to be as interested what is going on in terms of education spending, what is going on in terms of higher health care spending, are the investments we are planning to make on energy, are they right ones? Because, again, we are going to have some tough choices to make. I cannot just keep on I cannot print money. And so if we are going to make a serious investment in clean energy, well, that requires that we phase out dirty energy. And that requires that we stop subsidizing certain things and instead subsidize other things. Somebody is not going to be happy about that because they have been getting the subsidies, so they will start running ads on television saying this is a terrible energy plan. And you have got to pay attention and educate your coworkers and educate your friends and your family. And we are not my administration also here is [CARDINAL] last claim I want to make, a guarantee. We are not always going to be right, and I do not want everybody disappointed if we make a mistake here or there. The important point is, are we moving in the right direction; are we, generally speaking, consistent with our campaign promises; are we reflecting the values of hard-working middle class [NORP] who are trying to see [ORG] work for them? And that is [CARDINAL] thing I can assure you of, is that [DATE], you are going to be able to look back and you are going to say, You know what A, the guy worked hard on what he said he was going to work hard on during the campaign, and he may not have gotten everything perfect, but we are moving in the right direction. That is what we have that is what we are going to be focused on over [DATE]. All right, I have only got time for a couple more questions. All right. I have got to I am trying to look. I am going to go way up there. Way up there. Yes, that young it is a young lady's turn right there. Right there. [ORG] Q. Hi, President [PERSON]. My name is [PERSON], and I am a recent college graduate. My mom is a teacher and my dad is a disabled carpenter, so needless to say, I have accrued a significant amount of student loan debt. And I want to know what your administration is going to do for young people like me who are educated, who are new to the workforce, who would be ready to enter the housing market, ready to invest in small business, ready to take lower paying jobs like teaching, but cannot because we are burdened with an excess of student loans? [SPEAKER]. Right, well, it is a great question. It is a great question. Here is what we are going to be doing going forward, so let me start there. In our current budget, we are calling for mandatory increases in Pell grant programs to keep up with inflation, improvements in the Perkins loan program. We are going to cut out the middle men, banks that are making huge profits on student loans, just make those loans that are federally guaranteed directly to the students. That will save us [MONEY] that will allow us to expand student loan assistance and grant assistance to more people. So we have got a significant increase in student loan support slated in this budget. Now, I recognize, though, if you have already graduated then that may not that will be cold comfort for you. And one of the things that we are trying to figure out is are there ways that we can lower interest rates or principal on some of the existing student loans that are out there by consolidation or other tools. We have not announced an official program on that front, but we do believe that there are going to be some things that we can do. This is an example, by the way, of where the banking reforms that we are talking about are so important. We just announced some changes, for example, in the ability of the student loan market, the secondary market of securitized student loans to be purchased in such a way that we can reduce the interest rates on student loans for everybody. But if we do not help the banks it is going to be hard for us in order to lower some of these student loan rates. So a lot of these things are intertwined, and we have got to make sure that we deal with that. The last point I want to make I expect that over [DATE], maybe even [DATE], we are going to be in a position to sign a national service bill coming from the [ORG] and the [ORG], and as part of this, what we are going to be doing is expanding programs like [ORG] and [ORG] and other mechanisms, other avenues where you can make a decision as a young person to teach for [DATE] or to serve in [ORG] or to serve in [ORG] or volunteer in some fashion in your communities and help finance your education in the process. And I think there are young people all across [GPE], all across [GPE], who are interested in that opportunity, and I want to give that opportunity to you. All right. Okay, this is the last question. You know, I am going to on the last question I think I hold on [TIME], I think I want to call on I want to call on a young person, a student. But it is got to be a guy it is a guy. No, no, you are not that young, you sit down. That guy right there. The young guy in the T-shirt, or in the tie in the tie. This young man right here. That guy right there. All right, you have got to stand up, though. You look good in that tie. Education Reform Q. Hi, my name is [PERSON]. President [PERSON], our school is in big trouble because of budget cuts are [CARDINAL] of our teachers already have been fired, to get pink slips. And the whole school, my class, we made this. [SPEAKER]. Oh, you made are those letters for me? Q. Yes. [SPEAKER]. What is your name? Q. [PERSON]. [SPEAKER]. [PERSON] How old are you, [PERSON]? Q. [CARDINAL]. [SPEAKER]. [CARDINAL]. So what grade are you in? Q. Third grade. [SPEAKER]. Third grade. Do you like school? Q. Yes. [SPEAKER]. Yes, you do? Is that your mom next to you? Q. Yes. [SPEAKER]. Yes. She looks very nice. Well, let me as I said before, [PERSON], we are going to do everything we can to protect our teachers. We already passed a law in [GPE] that is going to give more money to the [ORG] to help keep teachers in their jobs. And [CARDINAL] of the things that we did not talk about earlier, we are also going to be putting more money into school construction, because there are a lot of overcrowded schools and overcrowded classrooms that do not are not wired for the Internet effectively. And we are going to make sure that we invest in that as well, because I want you to get a first-class education. What do you want to be when you grow up, have you decided yet? Q. Yes. [SPEAKER]. What would you like to be? Q. A cop. [SPEAKER]. A cop. That is what I am talking about, all right. Well, I can tell that you will be an outstanding police officer. Your mom is proud of you. We are all proud of you. Give [PERSON] a big round of applause. Thank you, everybody. God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksunity98dinner1", "text": "Thank you. I know you need a stretch, but it is going on too long. Let me just say the most important words I can say: Thank you. Thank you for your support for me and for our administration and for our candidates for [ORG] and [ORG] and for the whole concept of this Unity campaign. Thank you, Representative [PERSON] and Leader [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON] and [PERSON], all dedicated [NORP], all dedicated [NORP]. Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for the wonderful work that you have done in so many ways, and everything that we have done together in [DATE]. In [DATE], when the [NORP] people were good enough to give the Vice President and me another term and made me the first [NORP] President in [DATE], since [PERSON] in [DATE], to be reelected, we picked up some seats in the [ORG]. And if we had picked up a few more, we would have won the [ORG]. There was, I think, [CARDINAL] overwhelming reason: In [DATE], even though we had the issues and the direction, we were outspent in the [CARDINAL] closest districts [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. But we did begin this [ORG] concept a little too late, but it still did very well. All of our contributors liked it because all [CARDINAL] committees were not asking at the same time to give money or raise it. But it was the right thing to do, because we could work on helping particular candidates, targeting particular [GPE], going after particular constituencies, getting our turnout up. [DATE] we are trying to go sooner and do more. And I cannot say enough for what I believe is the vision of the leaders of the [ORG], the [ORG], and [ORG] for doing this early and doing it together and in good faith with a good heart. The Vice President and I and the First Lady and [PERSON], we are all committed to making this work. The Vice President gave that wonderful portrait of what is happened [DATE] through chapter [CARDINAL]. Chapter [CARDINAL] is, we win if we do the right things; if we do the right things, we win. [PERSON] came up with this great motto for the millennial celebration we are going to have on New Year's Eve [DATE] and between now and then: Honor the past; imagine the future. And we started out [DATE] honoring the past by announcing grants by private citizens to help us save the Star-Spangled Banner. It is hard to think of anything that embodies our past more. And then [PERSON] went to [PERSON]* home in [GPE] to talk about saving that and then to [PERSON] home, then to [PERSON] revolutionary headquarters, then to [GPE] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the women's movement, all honoring the past. But we have also had a lot of interesting lectures at [ORG] imagining the future. [PERSON], the great physicist from [GPE], [GPE], came and spoke in a very heroic way, because he suffers from [PERSON] disease, about what we would learn about the larger world in the future. We had poets for the first time in a long time, a genuine poetry reading in [FAC] with our poet laureates and ordinary citizens, including children, thinking about their future. [PERSON] said that never, at least-I quit looking at the Civil War because I am not sure before that political trends are indicative. But since the Civil War, the party of the President in the President's second term has always lost some seats at midterm. But there is a reason for that which we have determined to erase-and these records are made to be changed-and that is, that generally there is the sense that no matter how well liked the President might be, the term is [CARDINAL] over, so what else is new? Well, when I was reelected, the Vice President and I sat down one day, and I told our people, I said, Look, I want us to drive the agenda of this country until the last hour of [DATE] of my term in [DATE]. That is what we signed on for. That is what we owe the [NORP] people. That is the right thing to do. And if you look at what is happening [DATE], our party-I love what [PERSON] said about, when he was the majority leader, how he met with the minority leader and how we tried to work together. Because this election fundamentally is not about [ORG]. It is about the [NORP] people, and it is about our agenda, which puts progress over partisanship and people over power and unity over division. We believe this country has big challenges. We believe, first, you do not sit on a lead in a global economy and society like the one we are living in. You know, the temptation is, after all the tough years we had, Things are going so well now; why do not we just relax, kick back, and enjoy it? All you have to do is pick up the paper [DATE] to know that it is a reasonably dynamic world we are living in. If someone had told you [DATE] that [GPE] would have [DATE] of [PERCENT] growth a year during which time the stock market there would lose [CARDINAL] its value, would you have believed that? Is there a person in this room that really thought that would happen? If there is, I'd like to clean out what little I have got left in my bank account and let you be my investment adviser from now on. Now, they are a very great country, and they are going to come back. I do not mean that in a negative way. I am trying to point out that nothing stays the same. The way people work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world is changing at a breathtaking pace. Nobody is smart enough to understand it all and figure out all of its ramifications. But I know this: When people have the good fortune of good times, they should take their treasure and their confidence and think about [DATE] and deal with the long-term challenges of the country. There are [CARDINAL] big issues that I think will sweep across the country [DATE] and carry us home if our party will advance them. Number one, we waited [DATE] to get out of the red. Let us do not run out and spend this surplus on a tax cut or a spending program until we save the [ORG] system for [DATE] so that the baby boomers do not bankrupt their kids and their ability to raise their grandchildren when we retire. [CARDINAL], managed care, on balance, has been a good thing for [GPE] because we could not sustain inflation in health care costs at [CARDINAL] times the rate of inflation in the economy. That was an unsustainable trend that developed in [DATE]. But it is just a device, and it must not be allowed to block quality care. Therefore, we should have a Patients' Bill of Rights that puts quality care back at the center of the health care debate. People should have access to the medical care they need; decisions should be made by doctors, not by accountants; people should not be turned away from emergency rooms or specialists if they need them; and their privacy should not be violated in the medical arena. That is what this Patients' Bill of Rights is all about. It is a first step toward reconciling the imperative of having better management in the health care system with keeping health care uppermost in the health care system. And a lot of you are in the health care business. [CARDINAL] of the reasons we need legislation is, it is simply unfair to all the good people out there in health care [DATE] that are already complying with the requirements of the Patients' Bill of Rights because they think it is the morally right thing to do. It is unfair for them to be at an economic disadvantage with those who do not . So we need a Patients' Bill of Rights. [CARDINAL], we have succeeded in [DATE] in opening the doors of college to just about everybody in [GPE]. The [ORG] scholarship makes [DATE] of college virtually free to most [NORP]. It certainly makes community college virtually free to most [NORP]. We now have tax credits for [DATE] and for graduate school. The interest deductibility on student loans is back. We have dramatically increased scholarships and work-study positions. We had [CARDINAL] young people go through [ORG]. [CARDINAL] of you told me you had a child going to [GPE] in the [ORG] program, and I thank you for that. But no one believes that we still even after all this, we still cannot say that we have the best elementary and secondary education in the world for all [NORP]. We have an agenda for smaller classes, more teachers, more welltrained teachers, modernized schools, hooking up all the classrooms to the Internet, more after-school programs, more [DATE] school programs for kids in difficult areas with troubled lives-things that we know work-higher standards, greater accountability, more charter schools, more school choice. We have got an agenda, and we think it ought to be supported. So we have a better schools agenda. Number [CARDINAL], after [DATE], I take it no one seriously questions the fact that the climate is genuinely changing. [DATE] on record have occurred in [DATE]. [DATE] in history have occurred in [DATE]. [DATE] was [DATE] on record; [DATE] [DATE] has been hotter than [DATE]. This is not a joke. We still have [PERCENT] of our water that is not safe for swimming, in spite of all the work since the Clean Water Act passed. We still have problems with safe drinking water in some places. We still have too many toxic waste dumps in some places. If there is [CARDINAL] thing [GPE] has learned since [DATE], it is that we improve the quality of life and the strength of the economy when we clean up the environment in the right way. So this old-fashioned, antienvironmental rhetoric does not hold much water. We have got to face the environmental challenges of [DATE] and [DATE] and do them in a way that promotes new markets, new technologies, new jobs, but a cleaner environment and a growing economy. So those, I think, are the [CARDINAL] great national issues: save [ORG], pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, improve the public schools, clean up the environment and improve the economy. There are lots of local issues. In a lot of places our farmers are in trouble. A lot of urban areas, where we have a good empowerment agenda, still have not felt the economic recovery. But [ORG] first, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the school agenda, the environmental agenda, those things will help us to move forward. And if we can get the [ORG] to face our clear international economic responsibilities, which take an awful lot of my time [DATE], then obviously that is something that the new [ORG] will not have to do. And I am still hoping and praying that we will face up to our responsibilities as [NORP] and do [ORG] and these other things we have to do. But that is an agenda we can win on. You win elections with a message, with candidates, and with the means for the candidate to get the message to the people. That is what the [ORG] campaign is all about. I believe that I have gone to more of these events than any person in [GPE] in [DATE]. Therefore, the happiest citizen in [GPE] was me when the [PERSON]-Meehan campaign finance reform bill passed the [ORG] [DATE]. And we [NORP] have been almost unanimous in support of real campaign finance reform. The other party's leadership has been unanimous against it, although we have had some of their great renegades. We got [CARDINAL], I think, bolted and voted with us [DATE], and I applaud them. But until we get that done, we have got the candidates; we have got the message; you are giving us the means to get the message out; and you are going to have a lot to celebrate [DATE].

When his platoon was forced from its position by a numerically superior enemy force, and his platoon leader wounded, Sergeant [PERSON] assumed command, regrouped the remnants of his unit, and led them in repeated assaults to regain the position. Within [QUANTITY] of his objective he received a leg wound from grenade fragments, but refused assistance and continued the attack. Although forced to withdraw [CARDINAL] times, each time he regrouped his remaining men and renewed the assault. Moving forward at the head of his small group in the fifth attempt, he was struck by an exploding grenade, knocked to the ground and seriously wounded in both legs. Still refusing assistance, he advanced by crawling, rising to his knees to fire, and urging his men to follow. While thus directing the final assault he was wounded a third time, by small arms fire. Persistently continuing to crawl forward he directed his men in a final and successful attack which regained the vital objective. His intrepid leadership and determination led to the destruction of [CARDINAL] of the enemy and withdrawal of the remainder, and was a vital factor in stopping the enemy attack. Sergeant [PERSON]'s indomitable courage, consummate valor and outstanding leadership reflect the highest credit upon himself, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the [ORG] and [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], authorized by Act of [ORG] approved [DATE] has awarded in the name of The [ORG] the Medal of Honor to [PERSON] , [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an armed enemy of [ORG] near [GPE], [GPE], on [DATE]. Sergeant [PERSON], an assistant squad leader of [ORG], was participating in an attack against a fanatical hostile force occupying well-fortified positions on rugged commanding terrain, when his squad's advance was halted within [QUANTITY] by a withering barrage of automatic weapons and small arms fire from [CARDINAL] emplacements directly to the front and right and left flanks, together with grenades which the enemy rolled down the hill toward the advancing troops. Fully aware of the odds against him, Sergeant [PERSON] leaped to his feet, dashed [QUANTITY] up the fire-swept slope, and after lobbing grenades into the first foxhole with deadly accuracy, ran around the left flank, silenced an automatic weapon with [CARDINAL] grenades and continued his whirlwind assault to the top of the peak, wiping out [CARDINAL] more foxholes and then, reaching the right flank, he tossed grenades into the remaining emplacement, destroying the gun and annihilating its crew. Sergeant [PERSON]' intrepid actions exacted a toll of [CARDINAL] enemy dead and, as a result of his incredible display of valor, the defense of the opposition was broken, the enemy routed, and the strategic strong point secured. His unflinching courage under fire and inspirational devotion to duty reflect highest credit on himself and uphold the honored traditions of the military service.", "discourse_type": 0}

At that time he said, and I want to quote his words, we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. That very simple statement still expresses the purposes of this wonderful program, though the social security system has grown vastly larger since [DATE]. [DATE], as we meet here, [CARDINAL] [NORP] find social security benefit checks in their mailboxes [DATE]. This represents [MONEY] a month, [MONEY] a year, providing a much more secure life for our citizens and contributing a great deal of economic soundness to our economic system. [CARDINAL] of other [NORP] at their jobs [DATE] are building up future benefits and looking forward to [DATE] when they will qualify. [PERSON] called the original Social Security Act, and I quote, a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete. That is true [DATE] as it was [DATE] when President [PERSON] stated it. We are working steadily with the enlightened Members of the [ORG] and the [ORG] and the [ORG] here with me [TIME] to build and to strengthen the social security system. Legislation has already passed [ORG]--it is now pending in the [ORG]--which will provide increased [DATE] benefits to retired persons, to widows, to orphans, and to the disabled. [DATE], for the first time, health insurance protection for persons of [DATE] will become a part of [GPE]'s social security system. I believe that most [NORP] are looking forward with me to the day when these great measures are signed into law. In this country we all believe that every man wants dignity and a decent life, and not a dole. We believe that every man wants a fair chance, and not charity. We believe that older [NORP] have earned and deserve peace of mind, not pain and panic, when misfortune strikes. The social security system, and the historic legislation that is now pending in the [ORG], are our testaments to those beliefs. So, Mr. [PERSON], it gives me a great deal of pleasure to meet with you [DATE] and to present to you the [CARDINAL] recipient of social security benefits, your first social security check. I necessarily cut some of the observations I intended to make [TIME] when I saw Senator [PERSON], and the distinguished Senator from [GPE], Mr. [PERSON], and [PERSON], and the Secretary, and some of the others here, because I do not want to delay them a moment. And I want them to return to the [FAC] now and go back to their labors and continue to build this system and pass medical care.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksuponreturningfromchina", "text": "Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Let me just say I am proud of [GPE]'s congressional delegation and grateful for their help and support and for the way they represent their [GPE] in [GPE]. And on behalf of [PERSON] and myself, and from the bottom of our hearts, thank you all for your very warm welcome. It is been [DATE] [DATE], and now our long journey is nearly over. I was interested to read [CARDINAL] report on whether the meetings were a success or not [TIME]. It seems that [ORG], the [NORP] news agency, says that I was a failure at trying to eat a pigeon egg with my chopsticks. And as usual, [ORG] was wrong. It was not a pigeon egg; it was a quail egg. And I got it on the second stab. But we traveled [QUANTITY] to [GPE], [GPE], and finally, [GPE] the cities of [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]. We saw the wonders of that country and the fine antiquities of the old civilization. But I think the best moment was [TIME]-or I should say, [TIME]. Now, I had it all in mind that I was going to talk about coming through the darkness and then finally seeing the lights of the coast of [GPE] down below -and the coastline there, and that we knew that we were seeing [GPE] again, and we were home. Well, there was a cloud cover all the way over the Pacific Ocean. So, the lights that we saw were the lights of [GPE], and believe me, we knew we were home, and it was just fine. There is a poem that was popular when I was a boy. It was a poem about the [NORP] soldiers returning from the trenches in the First World War. They admired the grandeur and the oldness of Europe, but their hearts longed for the newness of their own country. And upon their return, in that poem they said: So it is home again and home again, [GPE] for me. My heart is turning home again and there I long to be. The blessed land of room enough beyond the ocean bars, Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. Well, it is good to be back in our blessed land. We went to [GPE] to advance the prospects for stability and peace throughout the world. And we went to illustrate, by our presence, our sincere desire for good relations. We went to meet again with the [NORP] and review our concerns and our differences. And we went to [GPE] to further define our own [CARDINAL] countries' relationshipand, by defining it, advance it. And I feel that we have progress to report. I had long and thoughtful meetings with the [NORP] leadership, comprehensive meetings. We each listened carefully to what the other had to say. We discussed and agreed to cooperate more closely in the areas of trade, investment, technology, and exchanges of scientific and managerial expertise. We concluded an important agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We agreed that in this imperfect world, peace in its most perfect form cannot always be reachedbut it must always be our goal. And we, the people of [GPE] and [GPE], must make our best efforts to bring greater harmony between our [CARDINAL] countries. It is a good thing for the world when those who are not allies remain open to each other. And it is good to remember that competitors sometimes have mutual interests, and those interests can make them friends. I told the [NORP] leaders, as I told the students at [ORG] [DATE], that we must continue to acknowledge our differences, for a friendship based on fiction will not long withstand the rigors of the world. But we agreed that there is much to be gained from mutual respect. And there is much to be gained on both sides from expanded opportunities in trade and commerce and cultural relations. I was heartened by some of the things that we saw. The [NORP] have begun opening up their economy, allowing more farmers and workers to keep and sell on their own some of the fruits of their labor. The first injection of free market spirit has already enlivened the [NORP] economy. I believe it has also made a contribution to human happiness in [GPE] and opened the way to a more just society. [DATE], before we left, we sat in a [NORP] home at [CARDINAL] of the now-called townshipsthey were once called communes-the farm communes where they raise the foodstuffs for all of [GPE], but now there is a difference. They owe a portion of what they produce to the government, but then over and above that they can produce on their own and sell in a free marketplace. And in this home, it was most interesting. This young couple, their little son, his mother and father living with them, and he was telling us all the thingsand he built that home himself, and a very fine job it wasand then told us of how they are saving and what they are saving to buy next. It could have been in any home in [GPE], talking about the problems of making ends meet and that they were saving for this or that for their future. And I was also impressednot only by them but by all of the [NORP] that we metby their curiosity about us. Many of the [NORP] people still do not understand how our democracy works or what impels us as a people. So, I did something unusual. I tried to explain what [GPE] is and who we areto explain to them our faith in God and our love, our true love, for freedom. They will never understand us until they understand that. It was a breathtaking experience and in some ways, I think, a ground-breaking experience. But for us now, it is very fitting that we return home here to [GPE] [CARDINAL] of our [GPE] that is equidistant to Asia and [GPE], a westward facing State, and a State, may I say, from which we have received strong support. When I was in [GPE], I explained to the [NORP] that our attempt to build up our defenses, after [DATE] of almost constant neglect, is an attempt to preserve the peace and preserve freedom in the world. No one has helped us more in our efforts to rebuild our strength than the members of your [NORP] congressional delegation. And I thank them, as always, for their efforts and their good sense. It is been good to talk to you and to see you and to be welcomed by you. Every time I come to [GPE] I think of [PERSON], and I always threaten to recite The Shooting of Dan McGrew which I can do, believe it or not. But I will not subject you to it or those tired and bedraggled persons over theremy friends in the press. They have been working very hard [DATE] to bring you at home the look and sound of [GPE]; and they are tired, so we'd like to give them a chance to rest. Maybe at the next press conference I will recite it. But it is wonderful to be here, and I thank you again for your very warm greetings. We will take them with us [DATE] when we meet here in [GPE] with a great man of peacePope [PERSON], who is also on his way to Asia, to [GPE]. His continuing mission of peace is a service to all humanity, and I look forward to seeing and having [TIME] with him again, as we had once before in [GPE]. But again, God bless you all. It is just wonderful to be here, to see you all again. And all I can say, as far as [PERSON] and I are concerned, we will be back.", "discourse_type": 0}

The Sun always shines in [GPE]. They came here in the snows of [DATE] over a trail marked with the blood of their rag-bound feet. The iron forge that gave this place its name had been destroyed by the [NORP] when General [PERSON] and his ragged [ORG] encamped here exhausted, outnumbered, and short of everything except faith. We gather here [DATE], the 200th anniversary of our independence, to commemorate their sacrifices even before we celebrate the glorious Declaration. [NORP] will remember the name of [FAC] as long as the spirit of sacrifice lives within their hearts. Here the vein of iron in our national character was forged. In [DATE] the colonial [NORP] was far more free and far more prosperous than his [NORP] cousin. [NORP] regarded us with some envy as appropriate subjects to share their grinding tax burdens. After [FAC] and [FAC], the [NORP] generals were impressed with our marksmanship and fighting spirit, but they still dismissed [GPE]'s militiamen as a rabble of arms. [DATE], when he was [DATE], a veteran of [GPE] was interviewed and asked why he took up his rifle against his King. Did he feel intolerably oppressed? No, never paid a penny for [CARDINAL] of them stamps, never drank any tea, never heard of [PERSON]. Only read the Bible and the Almanac. Well, then, what did all the fighting mean? Young man, the aging revolutionary said very firmly, what we meant in going for those [NORP] was this: We had always governed ourselves, and we always meant to. They did not mean that we should. Without [PERSON]'s eloquence, those are the words of the [NORP] people's Declaration of Independence. That was the straight talk that brought [CARDINAL] ordinary [NORP] farmers, workers, tradesmen, and shopkeepers-into this valley of sacrifice in [DATE]. Uncounted [CARDINAL] were never to leave. They did not die amid the banners and the fearful sounds of battle. They weakened slowly and quietly succumbed to cold, sickness, and starvation. Yet their courage and suffering those who survived as well as those who fell-were no less meaningful than the sacrifices of those who manned the battlements of [GPE] and scaled the parapets of [GPE]. In the battle against despair, [GPE] and his men kept freedom's lonely vigil. The leader and the led drew strength and hope from one another. Around the [DATE] campfires that dotted these fields, the flame of liberty was somehow kept burning. Something happened at [FAC]. That ragged, starving [ORG] here emerged and changed in a way that can be sensed but never fully described. They suffered, they trained, they toughened, they buried their dead, and they stayed. They stuck it out. When [DATE] melted the snows and green returned to this beautiful countryside, a proud and disciplined fighting force marched out of this valley to victory, into the pages of history, unaware of the greatness they had done and oblivious of our gratitude. As [PERSON] noted long afterwards at another sacred site in [GPE], nothing we can say here [DATE] can further consecrate or hallow this ground. But we can rededicate ourselves to the spirit of sacrifice shown at [FAC], [GPE], the Argonne Forest, [GPE], and [GPE]. Not all sacrifices are made in war. There are also sacrifices of peace. The sturdy wagon trains that have returned here, the wonderful people who drove them, and those along the way who rededicated themselves to the great principles of the Declaration of Independence offer heartwarming proof that our [NORP] adventure has just begun. Our [DATE] is the happy birthday of all [CARDINAL] States, a commonwealth, and self-governing territories. It is not just a celebration for the original [GPE]. [NORP] are [CARDINAL] people, and we can still hear them saying, We have always governed ourselves, and we always mean to. The earliest [NORP] settlers carried the Bible and Blackstone's Commentary across the Atlantic among their few cherished possessions and established their own stir-governments on a strange and hostile coast. [NORP] families in prairie schooners like these took with them on the overland trails the principles of equality and the God-given rights of the Declaration of Independence. Their restless search for a better life was begun in the spirit of adventure, but it was the spirit of sacrifice that sustained them. They suffered cruel [DATE], savage attacks, blazing deserts, and bloody feet. Many were buried beside the trail, but many stuck it out, dug in, and built permanent settlements where women stood the same sentry duty as the men. In the West, the Declaration's promise of legal and political equality for women was first broadened. The [NORP] pioneers knew that in their wilderness homes they could not be colonials ruled by a distant government. They had assurance that in due course they could govern themselves as full citizens of equal [GPE]. This political guarantee made all the risks and all the sacrifices worthwhile. Their children and future generations would have all the rights of [GPE], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. So do we, and more so. As we continue our [NORP] adventure, the patriots of [FAC] and the pioneers of the [NORP] frontier indeed, all our heroes and heroines of war and peace send us this single, urgent message: Though prosperity is a good thing, though compassionate charity is a good thing, though institutional reform is a good thing, a nation survives only so long as the spirit of sacrifice and self-discipline is strong within its people. Independence has to be defended as well as declared. Freedom is always worth fighting for, and liberty ultimately belongs to those willing to suffer for it. If we remember this, we can bring health where there is disease, peace where there is strife, progress where there is poverty and want. And when our [DATE] celebration rolls around [DATE], grateful [NORP] will come to this shrine of quiet valor, this forge of our Republic's iron core. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswallstreetprojectconferencereceptionnewyorkcity", "text": "Well, first let me thank Reverend [PERSON]. And [PERSON], thank you. And [PERSON], thank you for having all of us here [TIME]. This is the first time I have ever spoken from this microphone. You know, as [SPEAKER], I am superstitious, and we have had such a good stock market. I do not ever comment on itexcept I like the way it finished [DATE]. I wanted to say just a couple of things very briefly. First of all, I want to thank [PERSON] for his leadership in [ORG]. A lot of people do not know that the stock market was organized [DATE] so that there would be a mechanism through which bonds could be issued to finance [GPE]'s debts in the war for our independence. So, in the beginning, this stock market had not just a profit motive but a public interest purpose. This man has infused the stock market not only with its greatest success in history but with a public interest purpose, to include all [NORP] in our prosperity. And we thank him. Most of you were with us [DATE] in the [TIME], and I will not make you sit through my speech againor stand through my speech again, even though I'd kind of like to, because this is the first crowd in a long time when I have been guaranteed a standing ovation. I just want to make [CARDINAL] points. [CARDINAL], I want to thank [PERSON] for being there on this issue for a long time, saying we would never be the country we ought to be until we really had economic opportunity for allthat's what [ORG] is all aboutand that it would be good business, as well as good morality. The second point I want to make, that I made [DATE] and I leave with all of you is, this is the only time in my lifetime we have had a booming economy, improvements in all of our social fabric, the absence of crisis at home and domestic threats, and the absence of threats to our security around the world as big as those we faced in the cold war. None of this has ever happened before. The big question before us is, what are we going to do with this magic moment? Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things that [GPE] needs, or are we going to indulge ourselves in shortsighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and stability around the world? I am just telling you, we will never be the country we ought to be until every person, including the people and places that have been left behind in this remarkable recovery, has a chance to live the [NORP] dream. We will never be as safe a country, as whole a country, the one [GPE] we ought to be, until everybody has a chance. That is what [ORG] is all about. That is what my new markets initiative is all about. And I want to implore you to use [DATE] to ask all of our fellow [NORP] to think about those who could be a part of what we celebrate and thank God for [DATE], but are not yet. If we make them a part of it, we will really give a gift to our children and to [DATE]. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

It is always good to see some old friends and have a chance to make new ones. And it is always a pleasure to be joined by [CARDINAL] of the most important women in my life, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Well, it may be [DATE], but here in [GPE] it is been plenty warm until [DATE]. We turned this off just for this particular gathering. And [DATE], I guess we broke the record here for the length of a hot spell [DATE], before the reduction in temperature, and it reminded me when I was a kid of our minister [CARDINAL] hot summer [DATE] [TIME]. And he said that he was going to keep his sermon short, and he didjust [CARDINAL] words. He said: If you think it is hot now, wait. Well, [DATE] I will follow his example, though I may slip a few more in than [CARDINAL]. But I am sure you have heard of our plan to overhaul the [ORG] tax program. This is the most burning issue that is facing the [NORP] people, I think, in [DATE]. I am going to be out on the stump all fall bringing our case for tax fairness and economic growth to the [NORP] people and rallying their support. I will be in many of your [GPE]; indeed, in many of your communities. And I will be looking for your help, because it is the grassroots level that our tax proposal will find the energy, determination, and willpower needed to topple the status quo. Status quothat's Latin for the mess we are in. And the present system is a mess. As State legislators, you do not need to hear about the pleadings of lobbyists, and the siren songs of special interests are heard in every legislative hall from [ORG] out through all the [CARDINAL] States. But this time we can work for the special interests of all the [NORP] people to create a fair and equitable tax system, one which will be a double boon to the economy because it'll both close wasteful loopholes and, at the same time, cut tax rates. It is time for [NORP] to take their money out of tax shelters and invest the money in [GPE]'s future. [DATE] we live with the present tax code, we are slowing down economic growth, sacrificing jobs that would have been created, unfairly burdening families, and perpetuating an unjust system that only breeds cynicism and resentment in the [NORP] people. You know, [DATE] I spoke about tax reform at [ORG]. And talking to those college students brought home to me the urgency of this issue. The room was electrified with their hope and energy and enthusiasm. Believe me, having served as a Governor during the time of the [GPE] riots and all, when, if I went to a campus, they'd burn down a buildingto see these young people [DATE] has just made me sureand I am glad to tell youthe [DATE]'s going to be in good hands. And one of our proudest accomplishments as [NORP] is the way we have been able to draw more and more young people into our ranks. We have swept aside the pessimism and resignation that gripped the elected leadership of this country not too long ago, and we have opened our doors to the future. Like the [NORP] people themselves, we [NORP] believe that [GPE] is still young, still vital, and still strong. What we have accomplished together goes beyond words. We have backed our words with decisive and dramatic action. Our [PERCENT] across-the-board tax reduction gave new life and sustenance to a spirit of optimism. An entrepreneurial renaissance is spreading across our land. A powerful economic expansion is lifting [GPE] out of the devastation of [DATE] of high tax policies and enabling us to build on a solid base of noninflationary growth. Here is a piece of especially good news. The Democratically controlled [ORG] rated all the different tax plans that are presently floating around up there on the [ORG] and found that ours was by far the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. By raising the standard deduction to $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] for a married couple filing jointly and nearly doubling the personal exemption to $[MONEY], [MONEY], we will make it so that a family of [CARDINAL] does not pay [MONEY] in Federal income tax on the first $12, 000 of earnings. We are also giving nonwage-earning spouses equal access to IRA's, those tax deductible savings accounts. Someone's got to be very brave to suggest that a homemaker is not working. But alongside the pension reform passed in the last [ORG], this will go a long way toward alleviating poverty by allowing women the means to care for themselves in retirement [DATE]. Another report may be of special interest to you as State legislators. Our proposal to eliminate the State and local tax deduction has been getting a lot of flack from some quarters. Well, it turns out that the [GPE] government has a study by its own comptroller. It found that under our proposal, taxpayers in [GPE] would save [MONEY] a year. So, that is the point. If the individual taxpayers in your [GPE] benefit, your States and localities as a whole benefit. There is no logic to fighting tax fairness, to fighting a plan that would increase economic growth, create more jobs, give families a much-needed break, and take the working poor off the tax rolls completely. Of course, we still have a job to do in [ORG] getting spending under control. In that regard, on the revenue side, I'd like it known that I could immediately deposit [MONEY] in cash in the [ORG] if [ORG] will support this administration's decision to sell [ORG] back to the private sector, where it belongs. I was only a small boy the first time [ORG] tried to run the railroads. That was during World War I, and it was a disaster. If the war had gone on a little longer, I do not think we'd have had any trains left. So, we have an offer of that amount already. We can sell, if they will only give the word. As [PERSON] might have said, [CARDINAL] here and [CARDINAL] there and pretty soon you are talking real money. Some in [ORG] seem to think they can proceed as usual, indiscriminately spending taxpayer dollars, and that sooner or later they will all be bailed out with a tax hike. Well, for [DATE] they will not . There'll be no tax hike on my watch. We [NORP] have always looked for the long-range solutions, and this tax plan is one of those which will be working long after we have left office. As State legislators, you know that programs closer to home are more cost-efficient, better planned, and offer more assistance. But the gluttonous [NORP] tax system has robbed you of the base for local programs. We must continue to move this wheel of government in the interest of what is right for [GPE]. And this is the time for which all of us have worked, the moment in which we can build a partnership between the levels of government with a growing economy to give [GPE] the momentum for [DATE]. And, my friends, I am convinced that together we can succeed. And now I am going toyou know, in the business I was always in, you wanted a tag line to get off that would be popular- appreciated.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswhitehousereceptionformembersthefuturefarmersamerica", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Well, and already I have met someone from my hometown, [GPE], [GPE]. Thank all of you. It is wonderful to have you visit here in the Rose Garden, where you can still see a little of the [DATE]'s crop is left. I have been very interested in [ORG], your program of building our [NORP] communities. And I commend all of you individually for your wonderful work in helping our rural communities. It is gratifying to me to see young people like yourselves volunteering your time to keep these communities strong. And everything you have done, including OPERATION: Care and Share and working with local churches and various groups and other private sector initiatives, is indispensable to the future of our farm communities. I want you to know that I have been thinking about the problems of the farm [DATE]. In fact, we are , all of us here in this big house, constantly concerned about the challenges faced by [NORP] farmers during [DATE]. We are a farming nation. We always have been. The [NORP] farmer not only feeds this country that is [CARDINAL] strong, the [NORP] farmer feeds the world. And so when we contemplate the problems farmers are facing [DATE], we realize that we are dealing with a problem that speaks to the heart of how [GPE] lives and what [GPE] is. A while back I received a letter from a daughter of a farmer in [GPE]. She wrote of how she remembered her father-up at last light, no time for breakfast, out milking the cows, gathering eggs, feeding the dogs. She spoke of how always in a farmer's day something will break down, and her father would have to fix it. And then he would hit the fields with the tractor and the earth tiller, and he would not mind because a farmer is part of the ground he works. But she ended it with these words addressed to all: Do not you think it is time to say thanks to the farmer? After all, you stick your feet under his table [DATE]. Well, those are wonderful words, and they shine with truth. But we do thank the farmer. And when you go home, will you tell your parents how we feel? We have been trying to encourage a national farm bill that will help the farmer and ensure that you have a future in farming by making [NORP] agriculture more competitive. We want to put the agriculture industry on a firm and sound basis once and for all so that by the time you are ready to own and work a farm, you can count on being part of a strong and vibrant industry. And my great hope for you, for those of you who do aspire to farm for a living, is that you will be as wonderful as your parents are those people who are feeding a great nation and the world. They are the mainstay, the backbone of a great country. And I have got a little special place in my heart that is devoted to them alone. It is been wonderful to have you here, and I thank you all for coming. I'd like to just add something here. You know, [DATE] a [NORP] came to this country because this country had already become the great economic powerhouse that it has continued to be. His name was [PERSON], and he toured all over this country, as he said, looking for the secret of our greatness. And he told some wonderful things. We are pretty unique in all the world with things like you, yourselves, are doing volunteer programs where people set out to help others, to help their neighbors. It is pretty traditionally [NORP]. And he described it as how, he said, a man would see a problem, and he would not call the Government. He'd cross the street and talk to a friend, and pretty soon a committee would be formed. And, he said, they would solve the problem. And then in his book to his own countrymen in [GPE], he said, and you will not believe this, but there would not be a bureaucracy involved at any time in solving that problem. But he found the secret of [GPE], and he also put this in his book. He said he had looked in the busy harbors; he'd looked in our industrial cities; he'd looked all over for the secret of our greatness. And then he said he looked in our churches, and he heard our pulpits aflame with righteousness. And he said [GPE] is great because [GPE] is good. And if [GPE] ever ceases to be good, [GPE] will cease to be great. Well, I have taken more than my time here because I have got to get in [FAC] out there on the South Lawn in [TIME] and head off for [GPE] with some of our people and talk to the people up there. And you are all invited to go on over there and you girls, it will kind of blow your hairdos a little bit when we take off. We will shortly be taking off in [FAC], as it is called, out to get on Air Force One. So, again, thank you all for being here. God bless all of you. Mr. [PERSON]. Mr. President, you have long been recognized as having a tremendous desire to serve both education and agriculture, a desire reflected by the appointment of Secretaries [PERSON] and [PERSON] to serve this nation. As young people preparing for careers in the agriculture industry, and as part of a vocational education program in agriculture, we are excited about our futures. In particular, we are pleased to have you as a part of this national [ORG] conference on community development and would like to present you with this special gift from [ORG] and [ORG], and invite you to attend the 58th National FFA Convention, with [CARDINAL] 000 members in attendance, [DATE], in [GPE], [GPE]. Thank you. [SPEAKER]. Well, thank you all very much. I am very proud and pleased to have this. I have to tell you that there have been times when I hear a ticking I worry a little bit. In this case I figure it must be all right. But thank you all very much, and this will see that I get on the helicopter on time, as well as everyplace else. Thank you all.", "discourse_type": 0}

Scripture tells us, We count as blessed those who have persevered.

Here, once more, we pray for the souls of those we remember, for you, their families, who love them forever, and for a nation that has been inspired by your example: your determination to carry on, your resolve to live lives worthy of their memories. As [NORP], we draw strength from you. For your love is the ultimate rebuke to the hatred of those who attacked us [TIME] blue [TIME]. They sought to do more than bring down buildings or murder our people. They sought to break our spirit and to prove to the world that their power to destroy was greater than our power to persevere and to build. But you, and [GPE], proved them wrong. [GPE] endures in the strength of your families who, through your anguish, kept living. You have kept alive a love that no act of terror can ever extinguish. You, their sons and daughters, are growing into extraordinary young men and women they knew you could be. By your shining example, your families have turned [DATE] into something that those who attacked us could never abide, and that is a tribute of hope over fear and love over hate. [GPE] endures in the tenacity of our survivors. After grievous wounds, you learned to walk again and stand again. After terrible burns, you smiled once more. For you, for our Nation, these have been difficult [DATE]. But by your presence here [DATE], in the lives of service that you have led, you embody the truth that no matter what comes our way, [GPE] will always come out stronger. [GPE] endures in the dedication of those who keep us safe. The firefighter, the officer, the EMT who carries the memory of a fallen partner as they report to work each and every day, prepared to make the same sacrifice for us all. Because of these men and women, [NORP] now work in a gleaming [FAC]. We visit our great cities, we fill our stadiums and cheer for our teams. We carry on, because, as [NORP], we do not give in to fear ever. [GPE] endures in the courage of the men and women who serve under our flag. Over [DATE] of war, this 9/11 generation has answered our country's call, and [DATE], our combat mission in [GPE] will come to an end. [DATE], we honor all who have made the ultimate sacrifice [DATE], [CARDINAL] [NORP] patriots. And we give thanks to those who serve in harm's way to keep our country safe and meet the threats of our time. [GPE] endures in that perennial optimism that defines us as a people. Beginning [DATE], there will be teenagers young adults who were born after 9/11. It is remarkable. And while these young [NORP] did not know the horrors of [DATE], their lives have been shaped by all the [DATE] since, a time that has brought us pain, but also taught us endurance and strength; a time of rebuilding, of resilience, and of renewal. What gives us hope what gives me hope is that it is these young [NORP] who will shape all the days to come. [DATE] after small and hateful minds conspired to break us, [GPE] stands tall and [GPE] stands proud. And guided by the values that sustain us, we will only grow stronger.

[DATE], [NORP] will still build towers that reach toward the heavens, still serve in [ORG] that stand for freedom around the world, still wear the uniform and give meaning to those words written [DATE]: land of the free, home of the brave. [DATE], no matter the trial, no matter the challenge, [GPE] will always be [GPE]. We count as blessed those who have persevered. May God bless your families, who continue to inspire us all.

This is not my normal custom, but I have been working [TIME] on the [NORP] question, and something came up at [TIME]. This is an [TIME] ceremony that is very significant to us. I think that my own background in environmental questions and in matters that relate to the quality of life has been one of intimate and deep concern. And when I was elected [SPEAKER], my major purpose in dealing with [ORG] agencies that relate to energy or to environment, to the quality of life in every way, was one of appointing people in whom I had complete confidence and, also, who had the confidence of those intensely committed environmentalists and conservationists in our country. At the same time, of course, in order for us to be effective, there must be a working relationship that cannot create insuperable barriers between those who are interested in development of jobs on the one hand, those who want to protect the quality of the outdoors, the purity of life on the other. I think that we have been successful so far, without abridging anyone's deep commitment and integrity in past statements and beliefs on the [CARDINAL] hand, and adequate progress on the other. And I am very proud [TIME] to have a chance to introduce these men and women who will be serving in such important positions. [PERSON] is a man whom I first met when I was in [GPE] being briefed on the major questions concerning energy. He is a person who has been very effective in [GPE], in the legislature, in devising and drafting and implementing major and very innovative decisions concerning the energy question, environmental questions, protection of the coastal regions, not only from a present-day point of view but as they would impact on the lives of people in [DATE] to come. He is a very successful man there. And I think at some considerable sacrifice to himself, financially, but because of his interest in this subject, he is agreed to come and serve with us. And he will be the Chairman of those who will advise me on matters that relate to environmental quality. I am very glad that you have come to be with us. And I express my appreciation to you and look forward to working closely with you. Among my closest friends in the world are [CARDINAL] people who mean a lot to me, and I think in the past and in the future will mean a lot to our country. [CARDINAL] of them is Dr. [PERSON], who helped me in [GPE] to set up [CARDINAL] of the finest drug treatment programs in the Nation. He is recognized as the foremost expert on alcoholism, drugs, their impact, and the way to control them properly. His wife, [PERSON], is also one who has been very close to me. When I was campaigning for [SPEAKER], whenever I came to [GPE], not having enough support or finances to afford a hotel room, I always slept on their folding bed and they always took me in. And I am very excited to know that [PERSON], who is an expert on health care in all its forms, on the proper utilization of volunteer [NORP], who has a sensitivity and a courage that is absolutely superlative, is willing to serve in an agency that will spread this kind of knowledge throughout the world. The [ORG] program is one that is involved with [ORG], with [ORG], and with the recruitment and use of [NORP]--sometimes outside Government itself--who are willing to serve this country and other nations who are friends of ours. I am very grateful that [PERSON] is going to be the Deputy Director of [ORG]. And when I asked her to serve, she said that she would do it if I would be present at her swearing-in ceremony. Nothing could have kept me away. [PERSON], I am very proud of you. And I know this is going to be a great experience for you and for me both. Another very crucial agency, as you know, is [ORG]. This is one that, in a practical way, administers the laws evolved by the [ORG] and the President to make sure that the agencies of Government and business world, as well, are oriented toward the protection of the quality of life. There are many aspects of it: environmental impact statements, enforcement of quality of air and water. And this requires men and women in administrative positions who are knowledgeable about law, who are thoroughly familiar with the rules that have been laid down in an administrative way, and who can deal with forcefulness and understanding with the [ORG] and local governments and with private industry to make sure that in the face of progress, which is inevitable, that we do not destroy what is precious to us. [PERSON] has had broad experience in this field and will be the Director of this agency, and another very close friend of mine, [PERSON], who helped me get many of the [GPE] laws passed against formidable opposition because of her courage and tenacity and because of her knowledge of environmental questions while I was Governor of [GPE]. And I am very grateful that they are willing to serve as the [CARDINAL] top leaders in this important agency, [ORG]. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome them into the Government circles, and it is also with a great deal of pleasure that I thank them for being willing to serve. This is going to be a competent, dedicated, courageous, tough partnership. And I believe that the people of our country can rest assured that in [DATE], that our quality of life will never be abridged nor will it deteriorate. And I hope that we can set a standard in this country that will be emulated by other nations around the world as we deal with kind of an unexplored opportunity to protect the things that are precious to us. So, I am thankful to all of you for being willing to serve with us. Judge, thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstextremarksthejapanesewelcomingcommitteeluncheontokyo", "text": "AboutSearch Thank you, Prime Minister [PERSON]. Of course, I want to start my remarks by extending to all of you the President's apologies for not being present at lunch [DATE]. This meeting was to be a high point of his trip. I am sure you all know as well of his great respect and warm feelings for former Prime Minister [PERSON]. And it is with real regret that he was not able to be here at [TIME] [DATE]. As Prime Minister [PERSON] said, the President is fine. I talked to his doctor [TIME]. The doctor is a former classmate of mine at college. I know him very well, so I can assure you the information is correct. The doctor has told the President in very strict terms to rest [TIME]. He will be resuming his schedule [TIME] and, I am sure, will express to all of you his deep regret at not being able to join you at this wonderful gathering. Mr. Prime Minister, members of the [ORG], distinguished guests, it is a deep honor to be here [DATE]. [SPEAKER] has asked me to make his remarks to you [TIME]. Although there have been minor grammatical changes in pronouns, this is the [SPEAKER] speech. These are his words. We come to [GPE] at the culmination of a long and productive journey. [DATE] we stand at a turning point in history. The cold war is over. [GPE] has vanished and with it the delusions of communism. [DATE]-old enemies in the Middle East are tempering ancient hatreds in pursuit of peace. Freedom's phoenix is rising from the ashes of tyranny in nations from Latin America to Eastern Europe and from [GPE] to [GPE]. Freedom's rebirth was painful, its triumphs inscribed in blood, its truce seared by the fires of war and sacrifice. [DATE] has taught us [CARDINAL] crucial lessons: First, that isolationism and protectionism lead to war and deprivation; and second, that political engagement and open trade lead to peace and prosperity. [DATE] we again learned of the power of ideas. Technologies that transmit ideas in the blink of an eye carry the human spirit over barricades and through barbed wire. They hurdle walls designed to hold back the truth. We live in a world transformed, shrunken by swift travel and instant communication, drawn closer by common interests and ambitions, propelled forward by people's imaginations and dreams. As leaders of this transforming world, [GPE] and [GPE] must help build a new international order based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and political and economic liberty. We must shape a world enriched by open trade and robust competition, a world that will create a better life for people of all nations. [GPE] lies between [CARDINAL] great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific. We are a nation of the Atlantic by birth, but our ties to the Asia-Pacific region deepen [DATE]. Our [CARDINAL]-way trade is now [MONEY] [DATE], [CARDINAL] larger than that with Europe. Our prosperity and yours are indivisible. [NORP] businesses cannot flourish in Asia unless the economies of Asia thrive and grow. At the same time, [GPE]'s growth needs [NORP] markets open and growing. Since [DATE], the number of [NORP] of [NORP] origin has nearly quadrupled. What happens here is very important to us. And at the core of our continuing [NORP] engagement stands our alliance with [GPE]. At each stop during his visit to the region, the President has stressed the challenges we must face, addressing the new security requirements of our transforming world, promoting democracy, and generating world economic growth and prosperity. Let me expand upon that by focusing on the special relationship that [GPE] enjoys with [GPE]. Rarely in history have [CARDINAL] nations with such different and differing historic cultural roots developed such an extraordinary relationship. Our people are bound by shared security, by democracy, and by our deep economic ties. There are those who doubt the future of this relationship. There are reasons for tension. Here in [GPE] you have a saying, Some rain must fall to prepare the ground for building. We can all see that without progress we may be in for some rough weather. And I must be frank in saying that there are problems in our economic relationship. Speaking not only for [GPE] but for many developed countries, [GPE]'s trade surplus is too high, and its market access too restricted. President [PERSON] has come to [GPE] as a friend, seeking solutions to these concerns, believing that the expansion of free and fair trade will do nothing but strengthen our relationship. We in [GPE] are confident about our capacity for partnership. Our areas of common interest are too important. Consider the [CARDINAL] key areas of our joint relationship. First, the [GPE] security alliance. We enjoy a strong security bond with [GPE]. [GPE]'s generous host-nation support for [GPE] forces stationed here is an important demonstration of shared responsibilities. Let us make the most efficient use of our defense resources by building greater coordination of our military forces and by promoting the [CARDINAL]-way flow of defense technology. Such cooperation enhances our security and builds even stronger political ties between us. The Gulf crisis sparked spirited debate here about [GPE]'s global role. That makes it all the more profound that no nation outside the Gulf region provided more generous financial support than did [GPE]. The [NORP] people and peace-loving people everywhere appreciate deeply your contribution, [GPE]'s contribution, to the [ORG] coalition in the Gulf. Even before the Gulf war, but especially in its aftermath, [GPE] has continued to define its growing role in world affairs. An increasingly active, engaged, and responsible [GPE] is critical to a forward-looking post-cold-war community. That community will not exist unless its leading powers lead. This brings us to the second area of our relationship, our foreign policy cooperation. We must fulfill the bright promise of our global partnership. Together, we produce [PERCENT] of the world's gross national product. We contribute together [PERCENT] of all bilateral aid. We have the ability to marshal unrivaled resources to build a better future if our foreign policies are well coordinated. [GPE] has a responsibility here, but it is a responsibility we share with [GPE]. The upcoming conference on assistance to the nations of the former [GPE], now [GPE], is a timely example of such foreign policy coordination. The collapse of [GPE] has also spurred questions within [GPE] about the durability of [GPE] alliance. For [DATE], this alliance has stood as the bulwark of [NORP]-Japanese international cooperation. It is [DATE] every bit the linchpin of regional stability and bilateral cooperation that wise men foresaw [DATE]. The demise of [GPE] may confront us both with ominous dangers, but it also presents us an historic opportunity. The leadership [GPE] and other [NORP] nations can provide to help transform a once-totalitarian empire into market-oriented and democratic states helps guarantee the future peace and stability of our world. Let me add that with the changes in the former [GPE], [GPE] sees no reason why [GPE] should not regain the Northern Territories. We share this goal, and in whatever way we can, we will help you attain it. We cannot imagine meeting the foreign policy challenges of our time without [GPE] as a partner. That is why [DATE] Prime Minister [PERSON] and President [PERSON] will issue a document called the Tokyo Declaration, setting out the basic principles and major challenges of our global partnership. By putting into words the fundamentals of the [CARDINAL] great partners, we hope to guide the way through the turbulent waters ahead. We must be clear about our responsibilities and our requirements, for our renewed alliance will do much to define the shape of the post-cold-war world. Third, we must deepen our understanding of each other. For all of our interaction politically and economically, our peoples know too little of the other's history, traditions, and language. We welcome the work of [ORG] in expanding exchanges and interactions, intellectual, scientific, and cultural. Thanks to such programs, our [CARDINAL] nations will have an ever-increasing number of people who have lived in each other's country, speak each other's language, and understand more fully how important we are to each other. Although [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] students now study in [NORP] colleges and universities, more [NORP] must immerse themselves in [NORP] societies and cultures. As the exchange of free people and ideas flows between our nations and as the cold war ends in victory for our cause, our economic relations have taken center stage. This brings me to the fourth and most important point. If we are to expand our economic ties, we must face up to the economic tensions that threaten our relations. We must reduce those tensions now by opening markets and by eliminating barriers to trade and investment. We are now each other's largest overseas trading partner. [GPE] will sell [MONEY] worth of goods and services to [GPE] [DATE]. We will sell [MONEY] to [GPE]. Our economies, the world's [CARDINAL] largest and most technologically advanced, have become irreversibly intertwined. Closing markets and restricting trade have previously brought the world to the brink of economic disorder. Isolation and protectionism must remain the sleeping ghosts of the past, not the waking nightmares of the future. We must reject these failed notions in the sure knowledge that expanding markets mean expanding jobs and increasing prosperity for both our countries. We must ensure a continued strong [CARDINAL]-way economic relationship between [GPE] and [GPE], with markets more open to new goods and services, manufacturers more open to new competitive ideas, the financial services industry competing on a fair basis, and an equitable flow of technology on both sides. Our [CARDINAL] countries share a special responsibility to strengthen the world economy. [DATE] the President and the Prime Minister announced a strategy for world growth which commits both our countries to domestic policies to stimulate growth. Expanded domestic demand in [GPE] translates into additional exports to [GPE] for [NORP] products and jobs at home. And we are seeking broad support for growth policies among other industrialized countries as well. Many [NORP] businesses learned during [DATE] that the old ways no longer work in our changing international marketplace. Our companies have cut costs, improved quality, and championed innovation. As a result, our products sell in markets everywhere they have access. And candidly, such access is still limited in [GPE]. We must reduce the trade imbalance between us, not through managed trade, through gimmicks or artificial devices, but simply by gaining true and welcome access to your markets. We want to create fair opportunities for traders and investors, both buyers and sellers, by removing the barriers both seen and unseen to open and equitable trade. [NORP] business does not need a handout and does not want one. Some say that perhaps it is time to help [GPE] out of a sense of pity or compassion. Let me tell you, we are looking for no such help. What [GPE] wants from [GPE] is for [GPE] to recognize its international economic responsibility for its own sake and for the sake of the global marketplace upon which [GPE] depends. When we express appreciation to those who seek to open [NORP] markets, it is not because we need a handout but because we know an open [GPE] is good for us all. Our companies simply expect the chance to compete fairly in markets around the world. Our Government remains committed to open markets, and we will further reduce our own trade barriers as our friends dismantle their own. Our [CARDINAL] countries have embarked on a unique experiment in economic independence called [ORG]. In this effort, each side pinpoints the other's barriers to competitiveness, and each commits to reduce them. We both must reinvigorate this commitment to market access, whether for high quality [NORP] products or quality [NORP] services. The beneficiaries will be the workers and consumers on both sides of the Pacific. Improving our economic relations includes further opening your markets. It means greater openness in many sectors of the [NORP] economy still biased against outside investment. These practices hurt [NORP] companies, but they also hurt [NORP] consumers. [NORP] want the same things you want, a better quality of life for themselves and their families. [NORP] never say, Please raise our prices. And I will bet the [NORP] do not either. Every worker is also a consumer, and economic competition brings them great choices and lower prices. In fact, the [ORG] store that the President visited in [GPE] offers prices up to [PERCENT] lower than its [NORP] competition. The stunning success of the consumers' response to its sister store north of [GPE] tells the same story. That is good for us, and it is good for you. [GPE] export business is stronger than ever. We sold more exports [DATE] than ever before. We enjoy a trade surplus with Europe. [CARDINAL] of our economic growth [DATE] was attributable to merchandise exports. To [GPE], our manufactured exports are up [PERCENT] since [DATE], a [MONEY] increase that represents [CARDINAL] jobs. Still the overall trade deficit with [GPE] remains large. And I might add, its persistence is truly the exception among our trading partners. Let me say this: We have waited a long time, but now the time has come for equal access. Fairplay is in both our interests. As you know, [GPE] and [GPE] also face the urgent challenge of leading the way to a successful conclusion of the [GPE] round. Because of the benefits we each derive from free trade, [GPE] and [GPE] bear a special responsibility for tackling the remaining difficult issues quickly and decisively. The success of the round depends on bold, farsighted leadership. We must lift our gaze to the glimmering horizon of broader prosperity and not worry over the stones in our immediate path. Yes, all of us have problems with portions of the so-called [PERSON] draft, but we cannot let the progress it represents slip through our fingers. If we allow that draft to be picked apart by special interests, who wins? Not our people, not yours, not the less developed nations. No one. The [ORG] round is the world's best hope for expanding trade for all countries. Men and women from all walks of life and all parts of [GPE] constantly tell the President this: They believe very, very strongly in creating a level playing field for everyone. We want all our trading partners to give [GPE] companies the same kind of opportunities that their firms enjoy in [GPE]. That is not just free trade; that is fair trade. And it creates a basis for even greater freedom and greater prosperity for all. Many of our [NORP] friends argue that [GPE] must improve its competitiveness, and they are right. We recognize that some of our bilateral trade imbalance stems from causes other than restricted market access. [CARDINAL] reason for [GPE]'s competitiveness is because [GPE] has saved and invested at a rate double that of [GPE]. You have focused on applied research and development and new manufacturing technologies. Your companies have established fine quality control systems. You have developed a highly educated labor force and have taken the long view to develop markets abroad. There is much for us to learn from you. We are taking steps to boost our competitiveness. We can and will increase our rate of savings and investment. We will continue to boost our manufacturing's excellence. We will reduce the budget deficit. To stimulate innovation, risk, and longer term business outlook, the President is pushing for investment incentives, R&D credits, and capital gains tax cuts. In [GPE], cutting capital gains is politically extremely difficult. It would be easier if our politicians saw the positive effect on [GPE]'s competitiveness due to low capital gains rates. And [GPE] must raise its educational standards. Our [DATE] education strategy will fuel a revolution for better quality schools. This is another path to competitiveness. The education achievements of [GPE] and others in the Asia-Pacific region inspire us. That is why President [PERSON] has invited the countries of the Pacific Rim to send their education ministers to [GPE] for a conference [DATE] to seek new ways to cooperate and to learn from each other's accomplishments. With the President [DATE], traveling with him, is a delegation of [GPE]'s top business leaders. They have come to explore new business opportunities in all the nations the President has visited. Every one of them can tell you that despite the fact that our economy is facing some new tough times right now, [GPE] still draws upon tremendous strengths. Our basic research is the best anywhere. We have many of the world's finest universities. [NORP] technology remains on the cutting edge in many advanced fields such as computers and biotechnology. Our society is energetic, creative, and talented. It has the added advantage of drawing upon the strengths and insights of many cultures, including [GPE]'s. The chief executive officers accompanying the President will also tell you that they care about [NORP] jobs. They care about [NORP] exports. Obviously, so does the President. We know that the Asian-Pacific market offers enormous potential to those [NORP] businesses that will accept the challenge of competition. That same competition has propelled [GPE] toward world leadership. Open markets around the world has provided [GPE] with economic prominence. [GPE] must now join the ranks of world leadership in strengthening free markets and freedom. Finally, let me leave with you a message that the President wished to give directly to the people of [GPE]. And I quote: The [NORP] people are your friends. Friendship must be built upon [CARDINAL] pillars: fairness, trust, and respect. We expect nothing less, and we ask for nothing more. [DATE] marks a turning point for us in many ways. Together, we face [DATE], a new order for the ages, a new world of freedom and democracy. We stand as the world's powers with the future presenting us with a decision. [GPE] has made its choice against isolationism and in favor of engagement, against protectionism and for expanding trade. [DATE] we bid [GPE] to do the same because engagement and open trade are in your best interest. Together, let us shape a new and open world, a world of vigorous competition and dazzling innovation. Let us build a world of greater prosperity and peace than ever before, if not for the sake of ourselves, then for the sake of our children. This is the finest legacy that we could bequeath to them. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress121", "text": "Good [TIME]. [DATE] I want to talk to you about our Nation's duty to ensure that all [GPE]'s seniors can enjoy [DATE] as healthy as modern medicine will allow. I want to talk about my plan to strengthen and modernize [ORG] and the important steps we can take to encourage older [NORP] to undergo health screenings that can save their lives and improve the quality of their lives. For [DATE] now, [ORG] has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. [DATE] at [ORG], I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for [DATE]. The plan will strengthen [ORG] by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping [ORG] solvent until [DATE]. And my plan will modernize [ORG] by matching its benefits to the latest advances of modern medicine. Since [ORG]'s founding in [DATE], a medical revolution has transformed health care in [GPE]. Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it is a pharmaceutical. That is why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the [ORG] plan. But even as we modernize [ORG] with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize [ORG]'s preventive care benefits. [DATE], doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for [CARDINAL], early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is [PERCENT]; but if it is not , the rate can be a discouraging [PERCENT]. In [DATE] we worked across party lines to expand [ORG] coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. [DATE] [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] older women received a mammogram covered by [ORG]. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who [DATE] must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives. It makes no sense for [ORG] to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided. No one should have to undergo a dangerous surgical procedure that could have been prevented by a simple test. No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need. That is why my plan will eliminate the deductible in all copayments for all preventive services, for cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other diseases. And because [PERCENT] of beneficiaries still do not even know about all of [ORG]'s preventive services, we will launch a nationwide campaign to inform and encourage seniors to take these tests. We will keep looking into ways to improve preventive care for seniors, including strategies to help them stop smoking. In the meantime, I call on older [NORP] to take advantage of the preventive benefits that already are available to you. They could save your life. We must seize [GPE]'s moment of prosperity to strengthen and modernize [ORG] for [DATE]. There are some who propose spending our new budget surpluses on tax cuts. Well, I support tax cuts for retirement savings, for child care, for education, but it would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to all our families in [DATE]. First things first. I have invited leaders of both parties to meet with me at [ORG] on [DATE] to discuss the urgency of acting on [ORG] now. We have an unprecedented opportunity to prepare [ORG] and [ORG] for the retirement of the baby boomers and to pay down our debt, to make [GPE] debt-free over [DATE]. We cannot let this opportunity slip away. Together, we can find a way to make [DATE] a true season of progress for all [NORP]. Thanks for listening.", "discourse_type": 0}

[DATE] is a good time to give thanks for our blessings and to resolve to do better in [DATE]. [CARDINAL] of our greatest blessings as [NORP] is that we live in a country with a growing economy, where people can pursue their dreams, turn ideas into enterprises, and provide for their families. It is a measure of our economy's resilience that even with high oil prices and softness in the housing market, we are still growing. In [DATE], our economy added jobs for [DATE], making this the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. Unemployment is [PERCENT]. Exports are up. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Economic statistics are important indicators. Yet it is more important to remember that behind all these numbers are real people. These people include the entrepreneurs who live their dreams by starting up new businesses. These people include small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in our economy. And most of all, these people include [CARDINAL] of working moms and dads whose jobs provide for their families. I know that even in this growing economy, some of you have real concerns. Some of you worry about your ability to afford health care coverage for your families. Some of you are concerned about meeting your [DATE] mortgage payments. Some of you worry about the impact of rising energy costs on fueling your cars and heating your homes. You expect your elected leaders in [GPE] to address these pressures on our economy and give you more options to help you deal with them. And I have put forth several proposals to do so. In [DATE], [ORG] has responded to some of my initiatives. They passed a good energy bill, they passed a temporary patch to protect middle class families from the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and they passed a law that will help protect families from higher taxes when their lenders reduce their mortgage debt. But this is only a start. [ORG] needs to do more to decrease [GPE]'s dependence on oil. [ORG] needs to pass legislation that will help make health care coverage more affordable for small businesses and workers who buy their own policies. And [ORG] needs to act quickly on the rest of my proposals to help families struggling with rising mortgage payments keep their homes. Most of all, we need to set a good example in [GPE] by being careful with your money. I am disappointed that leaders in [ORG] sent me a massive spending bill that includes [CARDINAL] earmarks. Earmarks are special interest items that are slipped into big spending bills like this one, often at [TIME], without discussion or debate. Among the earmarks [ORG] approved was one for a prison museum and another for a sailing school. In the last election, congressional leaders ran on a promise that they would reform earmarks. They made some progress, but not nearly enough. So my administration is reviewing options to address wasteful earmark spending. As we address earmarks, we also must restrain spending, keep taxes low, and continue on a path towards a balanced budget. And that is what the budget I submit in [DATE] will do. You work hard for your money and to live within your means. As you provide for your families, the last thing you need is wasteful spending that will lead to a tax hike. My resolution for [DATE] is this: to work with [ORG] to keep our economy growing, to keep your tax burden low, and to ensure that the money you send to [GPE] is spent wisely or not at all. Thank you for listening, and happy New Year.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress527", "text": "Good [TIME], my fellow [NORP]. On [DATE] [TIME] I will present my plan to generate jobs and increase the incomes of the [NORP] people. [TIME] I want to talk with you for [TIME] about that program, its goals, and the thinking that went into it. As I have traveled our country over [DATE], a single theme has emerged repeatedly from all of you in every region and from every walk of life. That theme is the need for change: bold, comprehensive change to reverse the trickle-down policies of [DATE] and restore the vitality of the [NORP] dream. Over [DATE], while the middle class saw their tax burdens rise and their incomes go down, the wealthiest [NORP], whose incomes went up, often by paperwork manipulation and moving jobs overseas, saw their taxes go down. Higher deficits came with lower taxes on the wealthy. And those deficits forced Government to cut back on essential services to the middle class, the working poor, and the neediest [NORP]. Good families in embattled neighborhoods saw their children getting by with outdated school books, going to school in neighborhoods that were ever more dangerous, while the wealthiest [NORP] in protected communities watched their bankbooks grow. Our economy suffered through [CARDINAL] grinding recessions, and our job-creating engine stalled. The status quo simply is not working for working families anymore. The experts say we are in a robust economic recovery. And to be fair, there are some good signs: our best companies doing better, people being able to refinance their homes, and consumer confidence on the upswing since the election. But the jobs just are not there yet. The unemployment rate has been [PERCENT] for [DATE] now, and we are [CARDINAL] jobs behind where we ordinarily would be in a real economic recovery. That is why change is so important. And the risk of doing the same old thing is far higher than the cost of change. If we do not change, the [NORP] economy and the living standards of our broad middle class will continue to decline, and many of us and most of our children will not enjoy the standard of living that past [NORP] have. Change is never easy. It requires us to forsake the old order and to embrace a new one. Change means asking everyone to pull his or her own weight for the common good. But change is our only choice. Under my economic program, we will build an [GPE] where even the most privileged pay their fair share, not because we want to soak the rich but because we want to stop soaking the middle class and ask everybody to bear a fair share of the load; an [GPE] where the most impoverished move off welfare and go back to work; an [GPE] where middle class families who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded in their own lives and can pass on to their children a more prosperous future than they inherited from their parents; and yes, an [GPE] where Government is not immune from the sacrifices it asks of our people. [DATE] I cut the [ORG] staff by [PERCENT] and saved [MONEY] compared to the budgets of my predecessors. I have ordered further administrative cuts in [ORG] departments and agencies of [MONEY] over [DATE], with more to follow from tough and smart management. I am also ordering an investigation into the enormous cash bonuses paid to officials of the departing administration. In some cases it was done [TIME] before I was sworn into office. While I deeply admire the dedicated members of our Federal services, we simply cannot have extravagant payments made to departing bureaucrats and political cronies at a time when most people are tightening their belts. If Government is going to ask the [NORP] people to contribute, it must lead by example and learn to do more while spending less. That is a challenge I have embraced and one I will present to the [ORG] on [DATE]. Next, we will take the battle to the special interests. We will demand that those who see the Tax Code as a table game to be won rather than a social compact to be respected pay their fair share of taxes. I will keep my pledge to restore fairness to the Tax Code. We will raise taxes on the wealthiest individuals and companies in our society. That will be [CARDINAL] of their contributions to create the high-skill, high-wage economy that we seek. And I will say to the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the others who profit from the status quo, they must join our cause to make comprehensive reforms in our medical care system. The time has come for all [NORP] to have affordable health care, a real chance at a healthy life. In return for these contributions, we are determined to create long-term, good-paying private sector jobs. We will encourage the development of new technologies and find markets for them all across [GPE] and around the word. We will provide special incentives to new businesses and small businesses to create the jobs of the future. We will lower their costs of capital so they can expand and succeed. We will upgrade the skills of the long-term unemployed and the rest of our work force. And when military cutbacks hurt our enterprises, we will help defense workers to find new careers and to continue productive lives. That is what my plan is all about: a leaner, more efficient, more responsive Government; a ladder of contribution that demands the most from those who have the most; investment incentives to help businesses build for the future and create jobs for all [NORP]; education and training to prepare workers and students for new jobs in a new economy; a reformed medical system that restores peace of mind to family life; an [GPE] where every citizen has a right to a prosperous economy and a shared patriotic stake in the work to make it grow. That is a program for economic change you have justly demanded. Now it is time for all [NORP] to join the cause and embrace the change. It is time to restore the [NORP] dream. Thank you, and God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress534", "text": "AboutSearch Good [TIME]. There is much wisdom in these words from the Scriptures, Come, let us reason together. [DATE] we have seen a good example of what happens when people talk to each other instead of shout at each other. And unfortunately, we have also seen what happens when some people go to unreasonable lengths to prevent reasonable discussion and decisionmaking. I am speaking to you from the Pacific Northwest where we have just concluded the Forest Conference. For [DATE], the good people of the Northwest have been divided by a difficult argument over important values: how best to preserve jobs and protect the forests in this beautiful and productive region of our great [GPE]. [DATE] in [GPE], [GPE], timber workers, business people, environmentalists, and community leaders sat down together in a conference room, not a courtroom. We discussed how to achieve a healthy economy and a healthy environment. And I directed my [ORG] to come back within [DATE] with a plan for a balanced policy. Grass roots [NORP] want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving. They want to follow the same practice that we followed in [GPE] [DATE]. Unfortunately, some people in [GPE], [GPE], have not gotten the message that the people want fundamental change. [DATE] the minority party in the [ORG] used procedural tactics to prevent the entire [ORG] from voting on our jobs and economic recovery package, which has already been passed overwhelmingly by [ORG]. [DATE] we also learned why our jobs package is even more urgent than ever. After [DATE], when [GPE] lost [CARDINAL] jobs in the private sector, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in [DATE], and the total number of jobs in our economy actually declined. Now, some folks in [GPE] may think everything is fine, but all across [GPE] the people understand there will not be a real recovery until our working men and women can look forward to a secure, high-wage future for themselves and their children. The people know that [GPE] needs our plan to put [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] back to work by beginning the investments we need in a stronger, smarter economy. It is time to move beyond the old politics of partisanship, posturing, and procedural delays and start working together to solve problems. Good things can be accomplished when we reason together. And just as this works in our own country, so too can it work between ourselves and other nations. That is why I am taking my first trip out of the country [DATE] to meet with [GPE]'s democratically elected President, [PERSON]. Nowhere is progress toward democracy and free markets more important to us than in [GPE] and the new independent states of the former [GPE]. Their progress presents a great security challenge and offers great economic opportunities. [GPE]'s rebirth is in the economic interests of [NORP] taxpayers, workers, and businesses and the security interests of all of us. We spent [MONEY] to wage the cold war. Now we can reduce that spending because the arms and armies of the former [GPE] pose a greatly reduced threat to us and to our allies. If [GPE] were to revert to its old ways or plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess our plans for defense savings. That could mean less money for creating new businesses and new jobs, less for preparing our children for the future, less for education. Our economic program at home, more jobs and greater incomes for [NORP], could be jeopardized if the reforms in [GPE] fail. My discussions with President [PERSON] involve measures intended to help the [NORP] people make the difficult transition to a market economy by helping themselves. I want [GPE] to act, but [GPE] cannot and should not act alone. Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the Gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in [GPE]. Most of this effort will have to come from the [NORP] people themselves. They will chart the path to their own future. These efforts to offer an historic chance to improve our own security, however, require some action by ourselves, too. [GPE] still holds [CARDINAL] 000 strategic and tactical nuclear warheads. We are implementing historic arms control agreements that for the first time will actually reduce the level of strategic nuclear weapons. By supporting [GPE]'s reforms we can help turn the promise of those agreements into reality for ourselves and for our children and for the [NORP] people and their children as well. And we can make life in [GPE] more safe and prosperous. For too long, work in [GPE] on issues like economics, the environment, and foreign policy took place in isolation. The interests of the [NORP] people were not amply protected because their voices were not adequately heard. The change we want is this: to bring men and women of good will together so that we can put people, the [NORP] people, first. We need you to stay active and informed and involved. Now, I ask you to call or write your Senators. Ask them to take action on our jobs and economic recovery package. I ask for your best wishes as I go into this meeting with President [PERSON] and your understanding that here there is no clear line between our interests at home and our interests abroad. We cannot withdraw from the world even as we work to make [GPE] stronger. Together we can change [GPE] and change the world. Thank you for listening.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsweeklyaddress308", "text": "Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I talked about the idea of opportunity for all. Opportunity is the idea at the heart of this country: that no matter who you are or how you started out, with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead. I am even more passionate about it [DATE]. Because while our economy has been growing for [DATE] and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many [NORP] are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead, and that is been true since long before the recession hit. We have got to reverse those trends. We have got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out [DATE] will help us do that. It is an agenda with [CARDINAL] parts. Number [CARDINAL], more new jobs. Number [CARDINAL], training folks with the skills to fill those jobs. Number [CARDINAL], guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. And number [CARDINAL], making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that is there when you need it. I want to work with [ORG] on this agenda wherever I can. But in [DATE] of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more [NORP] families, I will. I have got a pen, and I have got a phone: a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. And we have already begun. In [GPE], I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In [GPE], I directed the [ORG] to create MyRA, a new way for working [NORP] even if you are not wealthy to start your own retirement savings. In [GPE], I rallied the leaders of some of [GPE]'s biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at [ORG], I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed [NORP] find work, no matter how long they have been looking. And I directed [ORG] to make hiring decisions the same way: based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job. So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class [NORP] and those working to get into the middle class, that is what I mean. And I am going to keep asking students and parents and business leaders to help, because there are [CARDINAL] of [NORP] outside [GPE] who are tired of stale political arguments, ready to move this country forward, and determined to restore the founding vision of opportunity for all. That is what I am all about. Thanks, have [DATE]. And to our Olympians in [GPE], go [ORG]!", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandchancellorerhard", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], Mr. Ambassador, ladies and gentlemen: We are pleased [TIME] to welcome again a good friend who comes representing not [CARDINAL] but [CARDINAL] valued allies of [GPE]. I refer, of course, to [GPE] and to [ORG]. Our guest is [CARDINAL] of the few men in public life whose title, Doctor, was earned academically long before it was conferred by honorary degree. Dr. [PERSON], all [NORP] join in congratulating you upon the richly deserved honor that you have received and we are grateful that you honor us as our guest in this garden [TIME]. When the Chancellor was last in [GPE], I expressed to him the hope that the dose relationship and the healthy friendship between our countries would grow in strength and in meaning. I am proud to say [TIME] that that hope has been the reality of [DATE]. It is evident to us that the relations between our countries have never been better than at [TIME] [TIME]. Our understanding is deepening, our cooperation is broadening, our hopes for the future are rising. We have come forward together, your country and mine, along the path of insuring freedom and security in a world where both are constantly threatened. [NORP] effort and foresight and determination and dedication along with those of our allies in Western Europe have made it possible to convert age-old rivalries into new and constructive relationships. [TIME] our hopes rise from this foundation, the only real foundation that can support and sustain them, the foundation of strength. We of [GPE] value highly this relationship with [GPE]. The ties between the people of [GPE] and the people of [GPE] are many and close. From [DATE] of our [FAC] to the bright age of mankind's exploration of space the cause of freedom has prospered when the peoples of our [CARDINAL] countries have worked together in peace. [TIME] we are working together as allies in [ORG], [TIME] we are working together as friends in freedom, and [TIME] we are working together as partners in peace. The road ahead is hard but hopeful. I have no doubt that [GPE] and [GPE] will continue to move along that road together surmounting the obstacles and serving the opportunities that we encounter together along that way. Our goal and our purpose is peace; peace with honor, peace with justice, peace under freedom. We shall not rest until [DATE] is reached and until that dream is real. We seek to move only on a course of peace and justice, never a course of fear or hostility. Together with our allies we shall work to open new avenues of trade and we shall work to build new bridges of ideas toward the East, to improve relations, to lessen tensions, to enhance the prospect of all of us living in this world in peace. As we all recognize, there can be no real and lasting peace in Europe, or in the rest of the world for that matter, until [GPE] is united, united by self-determination in peace and in freedom. This can be done, and the people of [GPE] are determined that it shall be done to end the inequities and injustices of the division of the [NORP] people--until there is a unified [GPE]. Only the representative and democratic government of [ORG] can speak for the [NORP] people. It is a very great honor and a very proud privilege, Mr. Chancellor, to have you in our midst [TIME]. The scene is a little different from our last meeting, the friendship is a little stronger. I ask those of my friends who have come here [TIME] and our distinguished guests to join me in raising your glasses to the [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE], to the friendship between the people of [GPE] and all the people of [GPE] always. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], Mrs. [PERSON], [PERSON], ladies and gentlemen: First of all let me express my gratitude for the congratulations which you expressed to me on the occasion of the honor which was bestowed upon me [DATE] when I was granted an honorary doctor's degree at [ORG]. This in itself would be sufficient to make me very happy, very proud indeed. But I was even more happy about this distinction and that honor because it afforded me an opportunity to come over again to [GPE] and to meet with you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to have new talks with you, exchange of views, exchange of hopes, exchange of worries and problems. Some people said after our meeting in [GPE] at [DATE] that was, so to speak, the honeymoon between the [CARDINAL] of us and they raised a warning voice saying, 'Well, let us wait until this period of the honeymoon is over; now everything is pleasant, everything is beautiful, but then they will be faced with the rough realities.' I think the honeymoon is over now and [DATE] we have reached, if I may put it this way, the state of marriage, but based on trust, on faithfulness. I think these are the pillars of this relationship between the [CARDINAL] of us. Though our talks dealt with a number of very serious problems, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], [DATE] I had the impression that our personal friendship had deepened and was strengthened over [DATE]. And if I speak of the personal relationship between the [CARDINAL] of us, I would add that I am inclined to apply that also to the relationship between our [CARDINAL] countries, our [CARDINAL] nations. As I look back over the period since I have been in political office, that means since the end of the last war, I think it was at that time unique, unique and unparalleled in world history, that the victor who had gained unimaginable strength and power through his victory showed such great generosity by helping all the countries of the world, including the vanquished, to reconstruct their countries. This was, as I said, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], a unique and unparalleled contribution. In this way you helped to secure the peace in the world. I said to you [TIME], Mr. [INTERVIEWED], when we had our conversation, I understood that your feelings were a bit bitter about the fact that so little gratitude was shown by the countries for what [GPE] has done after the last war. But such is human nature, one cannot expect gratefulness, and what one has received in the way of good deeds is very easily forgotten. But I am all. the more happy and pleased, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], to be able to say that these things are not forgotten in [GPE]. The [NORP] people will always remember what they have received from [GPE], and this I feel is the basis of the friendship that exists between our [CARDINAL] countries. That is the basis, the foundation, of the trust and confidence which enables genuine cooperation. I think we have all the essential objectives in common; and even if there should be some misunderstanding, some differences from time to time, I think there can be no doubt whatsoever, neither here in [GPE] nor in [GPE], that this friendship between our [CARDINAL] countries is a firm one, that there is also this conviction that we have common tasks and common missions to fulfill. I am not so presumptuous to say that [GPE] could speak for Europe, but on the other hand I feel that [GPE] can be, must be the stabilizing factor, the stabilizing element, in Europe. By our attitude we can show how necessary, how desirable it is for Europe to come closer to [GPE] and also to try and tie [GPE], or let me put it this way, the [NORP] Continent more closely to Europe. This I feel is our common fate and our common destiny. We do not want to divide and to split up the world amongst ourselves, but though we ourselves in [GPE], in our country, experience this tragic division and whatever it means, we want to make a contribution to overcome all these difficulties. I hope, I am sure we will succeed--what we have in common is this hope on behalf and for all the world. [DATE] we are trying to make our contribution to these common objectives. We feel this responsibility for the countries which are still in a somewhat backward and underdeveloped stage, or countries which still have to live in slavery. On the other hand, we are grateful to you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to [GPE] for the understanding you have been showing for our particular [NORP] problem. I have said on several occasions on this visit-I said it also [DATE] when I had the honor to address [ORG]--that it would not be a good and a right alliance, it would not be real friendship, if each country were to look at its own interests only, were to look at the geographical area in which itself is situated and would not look beyond that. And it would be a bad alliance, it would be a bad friendship, if every partner were not ready also to stand up for the other partners. We fully recognize the seriousness of your problems. I think of [GPE], I think in terms of [NORP], we consider them also to be our problems. We also feel an obligation, as you are understanding our particular situation in [GPE], our particular problems, and I hope and I am sure that this is a good firm foundation of our friendship and cooperation. I think all that is divided [DATE] can be overcome. And where there is so much good will and deep and honest friendship I am absolutely convinced that this good relationship will continue between our [CARDINAL] countries and that it will continue to be an element of freedom, of security, and of peace in the world. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], [DATE] during our conversations we have assured one another of our mutual sympathy, and when I have done that I think it was more than a diplomatic phrase or a diplomatic formula. It was, so to speak, let me say that quite frankly, a human confession and I think it was understood in that way by the [CARDINAL] of us. We are convinced that it is our common task, and I say that with all humility which is due to us [NORP] and which we must observe, I think this is a common task with which we are confronted. What we can do will be done gradually as a contribution towards peace, security, freedom, and liberty, and prosperity of all well meaning nations and countries in the world. In conclusion, I propose a toast to you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to the health of Mrs. [PERSON]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstoaststhepresidentandpresidentmobututhedemocraticrepublicthecongo", "text": "Mr. [SPEAKER], Mrs. [PERSON], our distinguished guests: We welcome all of you to this room [TIME] to honor the [SPEAKER] of [GPE]. But we particularly want to honor and respect [TIME] [CARDINAL] of our guests who are with us: Mrs. [PERSON], whose husband was [SPEAKER] of [GPE] when the [GPE] was born--she came from [GPE] and wanted to be here for this dinner [DATE]--and Justice [PERSON], who has had a very difficult time over [DATE] in the hospital, but who has fully recovered and who attends his first [ORG] dinner since that time. We are very happy to have him here. Mr. [[PERSON]], since I came into office [DATE], you are the youngest head of state to be honored in this room, and you represent the youngest nation. But though you are a young man and you come from a young nation, there are things we can learn from you. [DATE] I have a meeting scheduled with my [ORG] on the budget. I find in studying your administration that you not only have a balanced budget but a favorable balance of trade, and I'd like to know your secret before our meeting with the [ORG]. [TIME] when I welcomed you on [FAC], I told our [NORP] listening on television that the [GPE] was a good investment. I would like to tell this very special group in this room why I consider [GPE] a good investment. I could say it was a good investment because it is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources. But it has far more than that. It has, also, people who are able to develop that wealth if given the chance to do so. In my visit to your country in [DATE], I was impressed, of course, by my meeting with you and other government leaders. But I was impressed, too, when I visited a shipyard and the university and a factory and walked over the streets of [GPE], and I saw the people, working hard, strong, vigorous, vital and very proud-proud of their country, and with great dignity. And when we combine rich natural resources with a strong, vigorous people, and a leader who is able to provide the stability and the vision for progress for that country, then that country is a good investment, a good investment for its own people or for others who may desire to participate in its growth. I am sure that as we look back over [DATE] of the history of this country, we think of how time has capsuled in [DATE]. We think of the fact, as we sit in this room with the great picture of [PERSON], the portrait, overlooking the room, that a war between our [GPE] occurred [DATE], and [DATE], virtually, after we were founded. In [DATE] the [GPE] was born, survived a civil war, and now is a strong, effective, and progressive leader in the exciting new continent, the new Continent of Africa. An enormous amount of the credit for that development goes to its leaders and particularly to our honored guest [TIME]. I know that all [NORP], as they think of the [GPE], know that the [SPEAKER] has often referred to his country as being the heart of Africa. I think all of us at this table [TIME] would speak from our hearts to the heart of Africa when we raise our glasses to the health of the [SPEAKER] of the [GPE] and Mrs. [PERSON]. Note: The [SPEAKER] spoke at [TIME] in [FAC] at [FAC]. [SPEAKER] [PERSON] responded in French. A translation of his remarks follows: Mr. [SPEAKER], Mrs. [PERSON], ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests: I followed very closely your brilliant presentation, Mr. [SPEAKER]. And now I should like to express on behalf of my wife and my delegation and in the name of my people-what I should like to say here [TIME], Mr. [SPEAKER], publicly, is, first of all, all our thanks to your country for everything that you have done for my country for [DATE]. [TIME] in response to your kind words of welcome, and at [ORG] in response to Secretary [PERSON]' toast, I said this very forcefully, that in coming here I was bringing the message of gratitude and friendship to the [NORP] people, and I said to Secretary [PERSON] that we have a saying in the [GPE] that it is in adversity that you know your friends. My country, beset with problems and difficulties from [DATE], my country had added a word to the international vocabulary. That word was Congollzation. To [NORP] was to spread chaos, was to spread anarchy, was to set a bad example, the bad example of a developing country, giving it to the entire world. But fortunately, the [NORP] people, with all its succeeding [SPEAKER]s since [SPEAKER] [PERSON], [SPEAKER] [PERSON], and yourself, Mr. [SPEAKER], was never discouraged and continued to follow the same consistent line of confidence in my country and [DATE] we witness the crowning moment of this task of confidence. The [GPE], thanks to your Government and to the people of [GPE], stands up and is an object, if not of envy, of pride for all its friends and particularly for [GPE]. I should like to say that my official visit here has as its central purpose to say thank you with all our hearts for all you have done and for all you will be doing to assist us in our economic and financial recovery in the heart of Africa. Since I have had the opportunity to speak here [TIME], I must express publicly that we are setting an excellent example of cooperation between an industrialized country and a developing country. We are the living demonstration in concrete terms--the relations between [GPE] and [GPE] are a demonstration of what has happened because you have helped us, and we are showing proof that this aid was not wasted, that we have used diligently the aid given to us for our recovery, for our march towards progress. I am sure, Mr. [[PERSON]], that your voice will be heard by the [NORP] to whom you have said that the [GPE] is a good investment. You are right. This means for [NORP] investors, particularly of the private sector, that our recovery has been effective; that we have political stability, order, peace, and calm in the [GPE]; that the [NORP] people is cured from its growing pains; that a people without a leader has become a people with discipline, work, and creative energy. You have helped us launch the [GPE] operation [CARDINAL] which has succeeded. Our country, which was the sick child of Africa, now sets an example for all the countries of the developing world of what can happen with will, with determination, and this is a marvelous example we can show to the whole world. Mr. [[PERSON]], you were speaking of what the [NORP] investors value most. What they want in a young country is the stability, and that we have; resources, and that we have also. But even more than our investment code which guarantees these investments, there is the fact that neither in our philosophical doctrine nor in our economic concept is there room for the concept of nationalization. We respect private ownership and we see great profits to be derived from this policy. Confusion in the early stages of our history was taken advantage of to make people believe, and to make particularly [NORP] investors believe, that we would nationalize, but this is not true. There is no single private owner that can say that it was ever nationalized or that it will be. This will never be. There is the unfortunate case of [ORG], 2 which is often cited. I do not want to go into past history, but [PERSON] has said, The past can set an example for what we should do in the future. But I believe that the philosophy of the investors should be to pursue a course of honesty and abide by the laws of the country to which they wish, not to take advantage of the lack of cadres or trained personnel and if by chance the powers begin to open their eyes and be vigilant, they should not then say, We are being nationalized --this is not good; not a good philosophy to follow. I believe, Mr. [[PERSON]], that perhaps I went a bit astray [TIME]. I merely wanted to reply to you, to tell you how much my wife, my delegation, and myself are responsive to your warm welcome, the welcome that you and Mrs. [PERSON], to whom I pay particular tribute, have given us the welcome of your government and your people. We are touched by it very, very deeply. We can truly tell our people that here in [GPE] we have a people who have understood us through the good times and the bad times, that demonstration has been made that we are an example of the cooperation between an industrialized country and a developing country in the help we have received from you to our march on progress. This is something to make you proud and to this I should like to raise the glass of friendship between our [CARDINAL] peoples. 1 A [DATE] monetary reform program. 2 [ORG], a [NORP]-owned copper mining company which was nationalized in [DATE] by the [NORP] Government.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentswaynecountywestvirginiaremarksrallywitharearesidents", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Thank you very much, Governor [PERSON], who is destined, I believe, because of the deep appreciation of the [GPE] people for what he is and what he has been and what he will do, to be the next Governor of your great [GPE]. And I look forward to working with him during [DATE]. And I am also grateful to [PERSON], a man who sets a standard for public service that is an inspiration to us all. As [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON] and all of us who've served in [GPE] together know, most of the new ideas that come forward for us to address have already been understood and proposed by [PERSON], because he has his heart close to the people of this Nation. And when there is a real need for better housing, better transportation, better use of coal, better life for the working families of this Nation, [PERSON] seems to have a special sensitivity to understand that need and to lead the rest of us in meeting those needs for all. I am grateful, too, to have a chance to come here to meet with people from [GPE], particularly [GPE], because they are represented here by a great Governor and also by a great Senator. And [PERSON], a Congressman from across the river, is one of my greatest friends of all. Let me say that I have spent [DATE] thinking about the upcoming debate [DATE] [TIME]. As [PERSON] pointed out, my opponent is not out campaigning among the people; he is trying to decide what role he is going to play in the debate [DATE] [TIME]. The problem that I have had in preparing myself for the debate is, which [PERSON] am I going to face [DATE] [TIME] on television? Because as the election has progressed and as we get closer and closer to the voting time, he has flip-flopped on almost every conceivable issue depending upon what audience happens to be listening to him at the particular time. He is been strongly against, even prayed against, aid for [GPE], but lately he is been in [GPE], telling them how much he loves [GPE]. He was against many things for which he now professes to support. Not too long ago, as a matter of fact [DATE], to the automobile workers in the [ORG] plant, he was telling them how proud he was that [ORG], with the help of the people on this stage, had helped [ORG] stay solvent. But that contrasts with [PERSON] of [DATE], who said he did not see anything wrong with [ORG] going bankrupt. I do not know if I will be debating [PERSON] who now professes to be for safety and health of workers, or one who replied not long ago when somebody said that [ORG], [ORG], ought to be abolished, who stood there and said, Amen. I do not know if I will be debating a man of this election campaign who now professes to be for improving the social security system, or one who on [CARDINAL] different occasions has suggested making social security voluntary, a proposal that would mean the end of a strong and viable social security system. I do not know if I am running against a man who opposed selling grain to [GPE] [DATE], or the one who declined [DATE] to support the grain embargo after the [NORP] had invaded [GPE]. I do not know if I am debating a [PERSON] who now professes to be for working families, but who is against labor law reform, who is against the Davis-Bacon Act, who said about the minimum wage that it is caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression, and who said just this year again that the primary cause of unemployment was the minimum wage. I do not know if I am debating against a man who now professes to be for working families who are temporarily unemployed, or one who said not too long ago that unemployment compensation was just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. I do not know if I am debating a man who lately professes to be almost in the image of [PERSON], or one who a little earlier said that the foundation for the New Deal was fascism. I may be having difficulty predicting what Governor [PERSON] will be saying in this debate, but we all know which [PERSON] would sit in [FAC] if the [NORP] win this election. It will be the same [PERSON] who said [DATE] that he has not changed his position in [DATE], [PERSON] who worked to kill [ORG], who opposes national health insurance, who rejects [DATE] of progress in nuclear arms control, who wants to scrap the synthetic fuels program, which will take coal from this region and convert it into synthetic fuel, that is the key to breaking the [ORG] stranglehold which they formerly had on us. There is [CARDINAL] thing in this election that is certain, though, and I want you to listen very carefully to this, because you have got a good voting record in this area. [NORP] always campaign like [NORP]. You have heard them. They quote [PERSON]; they quote [PERSON]; they quote [PERSON]; they quote [PERSON]. But think about this question: Have you ever heard a [NORP] candidate for [SPEAKER] quoting a [NORP] [SPEAKER]?AUDIENCE. No! [SPEAKER]. NO. Never, never. But when they get in [ORG], they are just like all the [NORP] [SPEAKER]s that have caused hardship and trial and tribulation and forgotten the working families of this country, but they try to mislead you [DATE] before the election. That is [CARDINAL] thing you can count on. [NORP] will govern like [NORP]. Do not you forget it on [DATE]. I want to say just a word about coal. I am proud to have been able in my administration, working with your [NORP] Governors, [GPE] Senators, the Members of [ORG], to do more for the coal industry than ever before in the history of this country. Listen to this: We will produce more coal in [DATE] than has ever before been produced in [GPE]. We will exceed [QUANTITY] for the first time, and the trend is in the right direction. This is [DATE] in our history in which [PERCENT] of all our Nation's electricity has been produced from coal. Our exports of coal to foreign countries will set an alltime record [DATE]. And we could load [QUANTITY] of coal on ships to be sold overseas if we just had the transportation system and the port loading facilities available for this new demand for coal that is been brought about by the policies of our administration. In the near future, as you know, you will have an exciting, new, bright life ahead of you as we begin to produce synthetic liquids and gaseous fuels from your coal. We can triple-triple-[GPE] coal production in [DATE] if we keep [NORP] in office to help you. That is where we need your help. As you know, over [DATE], since the [ORG] has finally passed our new energy policy into law, we have begun to move on our new synthetic fuels program. We have signed historic agreements to help finance and to guarantee the construction of synthetic facilities, including the SRC-1 program in [GPE] and the SRC-2 plant in [GPE]. These major plants will be the forerunner of others in this Nation and will show why [PERCENT] of the [MONEY] in windfall profits tax will go to produce synthetic fuels out of coal. The [NORP] people have to understand, though, and this is an important thing for you to remember, that coal is both a clean fuel and also a safe fuel. If we are ever to achieve our goal for energy security, do not let anyone try to convince .you that the best way to produce and' use more [NORP] coal is to lower air quality standards or water quality standards. To do that will turn the [NORP] people and the world against coal. What these men on the platform and I have done, working with [PERSON], [SPEAKER] of [ORG], is to try to make sure that all the projected increases that I have described to you, all of them, include maintaining the quality of our environment. We do not have to make people choose between jobs and prosperity on one hand and good health and a beautiful [GPE] on the other. We can burn coal, let it be the bright new vision of an independent policy in the future, and still keep our air clean and our water clean and our land productive. Do not let anyone mislead you about that, because the best way to turn people against coal is for them to think that we have to lower those standards for air and water quality. [DATE] [ORG] extended a plan in [GPE] which will allow greater use of coal. This plan sets limits on average emissions over a [DATE] period, rather than a [DATE] average. And this will continue on into [DATE]. This would allow much greater use of [GPE] coal. Also [DATE] the [ORG] and [ORG] reached agreement on an innovative approach to control air pollution of the [ORG] plant in [GPE], [GPE]. Instead of controlling each individual source, it limits the total pollution emitted from an imaginary bubble over the entire plant. This allows the company to concentrate its cleanup efforts on sources that are the least costly to control. The result is more pollution control per dollar spent. This is the first practical application of this new principle. And now other steel companies throughout the Nation can do the same, reducing pollution control costs and thus raising capital or money to modernize their facilities and to put more people to work. [DATE] we announced a grant to finance a coke production plant in [GPE], [GPE]. This would not only mean new jobs at the plant when it is finished, but [CARDINAL] construction jobs and [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] miners will go to work now in [GPE], in [GPE], and in [GPE]. In order to meet export demand we are going to rebuild our railroads; we are going to improve our highways; we are going to improve our loading facilities at our major seaports. In international energy markets my goal is to replace [ORG] oil with [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] coal. And finally, let me say this: Coal is important for the security of our Nation. Many of you have spent your lives in the coal mines and in the communities surrounded by the mines. You have contributed a lot to the quality of life of other [NORP]. But it is important, too, to remember the well-being and the health and the safety of the miners and the miners' families, to protect the interests of the mineworkers. Working with [SPEAKER] [PERSON] and your representatives, we have broadened black lung protection, we have guaranteed mineworkers' pensions, and I have requested extensions of trade adjustment assistance and unemployment benefits so that workers do not have to bear all the hardships as our Nation faces up to rapidly changing economic circumstances and prepares for a brighter economic future. If [NORP] workers have the tools and the training, they can out-produce any workers on Earth. And we are going to give them the tools and training. With a new energy policy as a foundation, we are ready to move into the future and rebuild opportunities for jobs and a brighter and more prosperous life for [NORP]. At the end of the Second World War, [GPE] rebuilt the industry of [GPE]; [GPE] rebuilt the industrial complex of [GPE]. And now it is time for us to rebuild the industrial complex of [GPE], and that is what we are going to do. You help me, I will help you; we will have a better future in [DATE] if [NORP] are in office. Thank you very much. I am counting on you. Work this [DATE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmartynlewisbbc1britishtelevision", "text": "About Search Mr. [INTERVIEWED], your Secretary of [ORG] talked [DATE] of hard choices to be made on both sides. What are the main difficulties facing you andPresident [PERSON] as you sit down at the table [DATE] at the summit? Well, of course, there is a cloud of tension because of [GPE]. I determined long ago that it was important that this summit meeting go forward and be successful, and yet I would be misleading you if I did not say that the inability to get dialog going there between the [NORP] and the [NORP] does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in [GPE]. Secondly, I'd like to think we can move the conventional force talks further along than they are now. I think in START we are in reasonable shape, although it will not be ready for a treaty signing. On the chemical weapons side, I think there could well be good news for the free world and everybody in the world if they share my concern about reduction and eventual elimination of chemical weapons. The [NORP] questions are not solved by a long shot. How, for example, does [NORP] unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What is the role for [GPE] in terms of stability? So, all of these questions will be on the table, and I look forward to a very frank and full discussion. [CARDINAL] thing I have found is Mr. [PERSON] will lay it on the table, and I think I owe it to him to let him know how we in the alliance feel and how we in [GPE] feel on our bilateral. Mr. [INTERVIEWED] taking those [CARDINAL] at a time, [GPE] and the other [NORP] States are struggling for the kind of freedom and independence that is right at the heart of the [NORP] ideal. Are you in any sense embarrassed that your pursuit of arms control success is in fact preventing you from saying what you would like to say about [GPE]? The I do not think it is preventing me, because what I say about [GPE] is, [GPE] is entitled to self-determination, to determine their own future. You see, our country has never recognized the incorporation of [GPE] into [GPE]. But where it could be a problem is some say because we feel that way and we do passionately and because talks are not going forward between the [NORP] and the [NORP], therefore you ought to not have this meeting or set this summit meeting back. I do not feel that way. But I do not think it diminishes my personal commitment to freedom and democracy because we talk with the [NORP]. I would give you an example. We talked to the [NORP] when [GPE] was not free and [GPE] was not free and [GPE] was not free. And so, we have a broad agenda there. And I'd like to feel that Mr. [PERSON] wants to go forward with what he says he is for, that is, eventual self-determination. But I do not feel a conflict there. But if Mr. [PERSON] continues to deny the [NORP] and the other [NORP] self-determination, the right to go independent, will you not be forced to sacrifice the arms control treaty at some stage? The You know something, I have learned long ago not to answer questions quite that hypothetical, with respect, because we can conjure up a lot of scenarios, good and bad, and answer; but that I do not think is helpful on the eve of his visit here. But believe me, I will have an opportunity, as our Secretary of [ORG] did just within [DATE], to reaffirm the [GPE] commitment to freedom and to self-determination. You do not feel that you are sacrificing [GPE] on the order of arms control expediency? The I do not think so. And our agenda with [GPE] has far more to do with a lot of other subjects, too, than just arms control. But may I answer your question with a rhetorical question? When we talked to [GPE] when [GPE] was what we call captive nation [GPE] was and [GPE] was were we sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with [GPE]? Now, the world would clearly say of course you were not , as long as we adhere to our principle of self-determination and freedom. So, that is the way I'd respond to my critics. And you are saying that arms control is the most important thing on your agenda, and you will go for that come what may? No, I am not saying that is the most important. That is what you are saying or suggesting or asking me if I am saying. We have a lot of regional problems that we discuss with [GPE]. We have the whole question of [NORP] unification Europe that is very, very important to the people in the [GPE] and [GPE] and other [ORG] countries. We have the questions of [NORP] participation in [ORG] a vital question. So, I am not trying to set out for you priorities. Do I think arms control is important? Yes. Are we working with diligence to try to have a good arms control agenda? Absolutely. But I cannot tell you that is the only thing that drives the meetings between me and Mr. [PERSON]. I want to talk to him frankly about things in Europe and in this hemisphere, and I do not want these [CARDINAL] gigantic ships to pass in [TIME] because of misunderstanding. Finally, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] do you think that Mr. [PERSON] is going to survive, that he is going to be the person you will be negotiating with in [DATE] time, given the pressures that he has from the [NORP] and the radicals on one hand and from the military on the other? The I am inclined to think the answer to your question is yes, but it is not my role as President of [GPE] to try to sort out who should lead [GPE]. In Mr. [PERSON] I see a man who has presided over dramatic changes in Eastern Europe that benefit freedom and benefit mankind, if you will, and so I give him credit for that. I see somebody who is talking about perestroika and reform inside and openness, glasnost inside [GPE], and I give credit for that. But [NORP] leadership is up to the [NORP] people. And I do not think one's foreign policy can be determined or be predicated on [CARDINAL] person cannot be. But I think most [NORP] leaders feel that in Mr. [PERSON] we have a man with whom we can talk frankly, with whom we agree on many principles; a man who has many problems, internal problems, facing him I am talking about predominately economic problems a man who has tried to work with us constructively on many fields. So, that is why we are going to approach this summit with great openness, and yet there are outside events and you mentioned [GPE] outside concerns that put a little bit of a tension on this meeting. But in terms of my sitting down, up at [FAC], and talking frankly with Mr. [PERSON], he is the kind of person you can do that with. And I believe that that is useful to every country that [GPE] deal in this manner with Mr. [PERSON]. But that is not to say we have no problems. Mr. [INTERVIEWED] thank you very much for talking to the audience.", "discourse_type": 1}

Well, [DATE] I probably play once every two to three weeks. Not as often as I like, but during say, the Health Care Debate, when things are just, you know, going crazy over on Capitol Hill, a lot of times I will just come out here and shoot or I will play a game of HORSE it takes an edge off things. Now [DATE] when you are involved in Pick-Up games, do you feel that you are dealing with less physical contact since you became [INTERVIEWED]? Well it is true I usually have guys with guns around. Yeah, I noticed. The So, if somebody, you know, takes a real hard fall -- foul, they could get in trouble. Nobody ever lets me with because if you let me win, you will never hear the end of it. I will talk a little trash about you. I will make you feel bad about yourself if we beat you real bad. Now, I am assuming that Bowling is not on the schedule? The You know, my bowling has greatly improved. So [PERSON], you are touching on a slightly sensitive point. I am not going to walk off the set here but, we do have a bowling alley here at [FAC] and I have gotten a lot better. Now do you find yourself, as we all have back in the day on the playground, doing play-by-play to yourself? You come out here, maybe count it down. For example the game is tied -- The In the back of my mind, [INTERVIEWER1] is making the call. So, it is [PERSON] with the ball. Top of the key, [TIME] left... Unleashes for [CARDINAL]. Yes! The I have your voice in my head as I am shooting the [CARDINAL]. That is sad. Now I know you do not want to be accused of tampering for your [ORG] but, any advice that you might have, for [PERSON] as he approaches free agency? The I think that the most important thing for [PERSON] right now is actually to find a structure where he is got a coach that he respects and is working hard with teammates who care about him and if that is in [GPE], then he should stay in [GPE]. If he does not feel like he can get it there, then someplace else. The [CARDINAL] thing I remember about the [ORG] was it was not until [PERSON] had confidence in [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON]; it was not until you got that framework around you that you could be a champion. Same thing happened with [PERSON]. First with [PERSON] then later with [PERSON], you know, he is gotten that sense of a team around him and I think [PERSON] has not quite been able to get that yet; that is what he needs to find. Could you, on behalf of the [ORG], throw in perhaps a night in the Lincoln Bedroom or ride on Air Force One? You know, like I said, I do not want to mettle. I will say this, [PERSON], [PERSON] -- It is a pretty good core. It is a pretty good core. You know, you could see [PERSON] fitting in pretty well. If you were [ORG] Commissioner for [DATE], what changes would you make? You know, I will be honest with you, I think the game is in a good place right now. The way they are calling the game right now returns basketball to where its supposed to be; more of a finesse game. The biggest change I'd probably propose right now is, the commissioner needs to figure out how to price tickets so that ordinary people can go to the games. I mean I think that ticket prices have gotten so high, and I understand that salaries are high, ticket prices are going to be high but, you know, you hate to think that the only person that can go to a game is somebody who is got a corporate account. And that is something that I'd love all professional sports, that is not just [ORG], but all professional sports to be thinking about a little more. Alright [ORG], in the news recently wearing the [ORG] jerseys on Cinco de Mayo. And they took a stand opposing [GPE]'s immigration policy, how do you feel about sports franchises getting involved in political issues? You know, I think that just because somebody's a sports figure or you got a sports team does not mean that you are not part of the community and you are not part of our democracy. I think it is terrific that the [ORG], who obviously feel very strong about their community, recognize that a big part of their community felt threatened by this new law. You know, when I was growing up, you had figures like [PERSON] and [PERSON] who routinely would talk about the world around them. You would not always agree with them but, that sense that, you know, people are engaged in the big issues of [DATE], I think is a positive thing and I do not think that either players or franchises need to always steer away from controversy. I happen to personally think that the Arizona Law is a bad idea, I have said so publicly and I see no reason why these guys cannot make the same statement. Here in [GPE], it is a great deal of excitement. [ORG], now in possession of the overall first round pick. [PERSON] of [ORG] would be, I would guess, the early line favorite. What is your, I know you watch a lot of college basketball, what is your scouting report? [PERSON] is a terrific player. I mean, you know, he is got the [ORG] speed, [ORG] body, great jump shot, unselfish, really impressive. There is only upside for that kid. And I think it'd be great for him to come to [GPE]. I became very close to [PERSON], who was a great supporter, he and wife. He just passes away recently but there is an example of a guy who constantly gave back to his community. I mean, almost single-handedly, he invested in downtown [GPE] at a time when it was in really bad shape. You know, generated huge affection in this city and it was wonderful to see his widow there; getting that number [CARDINAL] pick and I only wish the best for that franchise. What is the Presidential pick for this [DATE]'s [ORG]? The [ORG] surprised me. They gelled in the playoffs in a way that they had not all through the season. [PERSON]'s become one of the best point guards in the league in no time. I mean, when he gets a real jump shot, he is going to be unstoppable but I have got to go with the [ORG] again. I think [PERSON] may be the best big man in the league right now. He is different from [PERSON] but he is playing -- Great footwork. -- unbelievable footwork. Speed savvy, he is playing magnificently. [PERSON] is, you know, the fiercest competitor in the league and they have got, you know, what I continue to believe is the best coach in the [ORG] right now in [PERSON] so there going to be formidable and I think it'll be a tough series. You know, [ORG]'s a veteran club but the [ORG] are looking pretty good. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], we appreciate your taking the time and I really like your back yard. Listen, you are welcome, [PERSON], to call play-by-play in any pick up game that we have. I want you to let [PERSON] know and [PERSON] know, that I appreciate them. And I am curious about [PERSON]' golf game though. I want to see if that swing ever got fixed. A lot of people are curious about that. [PERSON] is a great guy, great friend but that is , it is a scary golf swing.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarvinstoneandjosephfrommusnewsworldreport", "text": "AboutSearch Mr. [INTERVIEWED], as we look ahead into [DATE], we would ask that you address [CARDINAL] of the most critical foreign policy issues that concern [NORP]. First, in [DATE], how do you propose to rebuild a working relationship with [GPE] and revive meaningful arms control negotiations? The [INTERVIEWED]. We can do it, because those negotiations are as much value to [GPE] as they are to anyone else. Even more important. I have to point out that, with all this talk about the supposed strain in relations, there is an inference that somehow it is our fault. But we did not kill [NORP] citizens by shooting down a civilian airplane. We did not attempt to conquer an adjacent country to ours. We did not walk out on negotiations and refuse to give a date for when we would resume. If there is a strain, it has not been caused by us. Do you believe the extended absence of [PERSON] from the picture where under certain circumstances you might have been able to have a meaningful exchange with him is affecting this relationship with the [NORP]? The [INTERVIEWED]. I still think we can continue to deal with them and resolve problems between us. The biggest problem we all face is achieving genuine peace in the world. I do not think they want a confrontation any more than we do. We will be at that negotiating table when the [NORP] decide to come back ready to negotiate in good faith. We have never broken off communications. We have at several levels continued to meet with the [NORP] and we are ready. I know, on the other hand, that the absence of [PERSON] must have had some influence on their side on exactly what could be done. I believe that [GPE] has more to gain than we, or anyone else, in taking a look at changing the situation and, in effect, them joining the family of nations the way the rest of us have who are concerned with peace. Issue [CARDINAL] deals with the Middle East. A main concern is [GPE]. Do you believe that in [DATE] it is going to be possible to withdraw our marines? And will it be feasible to do that only if and when a stable government is able to unify [GPE]? The [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it will be possible to withdraw the marines in [DATE]. And that applies as well to the whole multinational force. Let me remind you why we sent the marines to [GPE] as part of the multinational force. Our whole idea all along has been to bring peace to the Middle East area generally and to act as a kind of go-between to bring these warring nations together. But [GPE] stood in the way. You will remember that in [DATE] [GPE] was being shelled in every direction, and in [DATE] the authorities there had asked the [NORP] to come in and help keep order, because [ORG] was virtually nonexistent and powerless to do anything about it. The multinational force moved in and created conditions that led to the partial withdrawal of the [NORP]. Now there has been a change in [GPE]'s position. Even after a request from [ORG] to withdraw, the [NORP] have refused, and they are still there. We believe that the purpose of the multinational force would be accomplished with the withdrawal of the other foreign powers and the establishment of a stable [NORP] Government, supported by a rebuilt [NORP] Army. We have done a fine job of training and equipping [ORG]. It needs to be some bigger than it is. But it is a good and a well-trained force. And it has performed well. The idea was that as the foreign forces left and as the [NORP] forces moved out toward their borders to reinstitute control and stop the internecine fight, the multinational force would maintain order for example, in areas like [GPE] because the [NORP] military could not do both. This is still the goal. Is that still a realistic goal? The I think that, with all that is happening, we are overlooking the progress that is been made. At recent discussions in [GPE], all of those involved even those who are presently hostile agreed to recognize the [NORP] government as the legitimate Government of [GPE]. Another sign of progress is the fact, as I mentioned, that [ORG] has been brought up to a capability it did not have before. But now further progress hinges particularly on [GPE], which is the stopping block in its refusal to withdraw even though it had once agreed to leave and said that if [GPE] left, it would leave. I do not say that the multinational force has to stay until all those foreign forces are out. I think that even if they gave an assurance that they are going to go and start the process maybe we could then leave. Subject [CARDINAL]: With the prospect of continuing widespread terrorist attacks, how can [GPE] retaliate, especially when such attacks are inspired or sponsored by governments? The [CARDINAL] of the hardest things, of course, is to prove that the terrorist attacks are sponsored by a government. For example, these groups that are taking credit for the recent suicide attacks are believed to have an [NORP] connection. There is a faction of [NORP] that believe in a holy war. We do have the evidence that [PERSON] has spoken a number of times about advocating a holy war in the [NORP] world to promote his type of fundamentalism. So, it is hard not to believe that he must, in some way, instigate or at least egg on those that are doing these things. What can be done to counter the terrorist threat? The I believe that if terrorists are claiming triumphs when they do these terrible deeds, acknowledging what their goal is and that they have a connection with some country then I think it is up to the government of that country to try to curb and control such groups. If some of our own terrorist groups commit these outrages such as the group that just bombed a naval recruiting station in [GPE] it is our responsibility to corral them, find out who and what they are, and bring them to justice. But the same is true for all the other countries. But the [CARDINAL] thing we cannot do is what so many people, even here in our own country, are advocating in the face of the terrorist attacks against our forces in [GPE]. That is to bring home the marines from [GPE]. If terrorism can succeed in its goal, then the world is going to find itself under the control of the terrorists. You have to stand against that and not let it succeed. What do you do if a government is actually responsible, as you say, for instigating terrorism? Can you really ask that kind of a government to assume responsibility for controlling these terrorists? The [INTERVIEWED]. In those cases, I think that the civilized world has to get together and see what action can be taken. This does not necessarily mean warlike action, but pressures that can be put on a government-pressures such as saying to that government, You start taking some steps to control this, or you will be outlawed in the rest of the world. Another issue; you are going to [GPE] in [DATE]. What, in your view, is going to be necessary to develop closer relations with that country, particularly in the strategic field? And do [GPE] ties with [GPE] inhibit the process of improving relations with [GPE]? [GPE] Relations The I do not think they do. I know that [GPE] is uncomfortable with our position on [GPE]. But we have reiterated time and time again to them that the people of [GPE] are longtime friends and, in fact, once were allies of ours. We have recognized that there is [CARDINAL] [GPE] and that its capital is [GPE]. But we believe that the differences between [GPE] and [GPE] should be settled by peaceful negotiations. We cannot cast aside [CARDINAL] friend in order to make another. We have argued to representatives of [ORG] that they themselves should take some comfort from that because it is assurance to them that we would not throw them aside to make friends with someone else. I think we have made great progress. I know that sometimes [ORG] has to speak out about this issue, but our trade relations and cooperation in the area of high technology, all of these things represent milestones and successive steps in improving our relations. Now, the head of their government is coming here, and I am going there in [DATE]. We are going to find other areas where we can improve and increase our relationship cultural exchanges, things of that kind. All of this, I think, is on a good track. We have made some gains. Fifth: What strategy does the administration intend to pursue in Central America? Is it to underwrite [ORG] indefinitely? And in [GPE], is it to settle for nothing less than the overthrow of the [NORP]? The Our policy in Central America is regional. This is very much what the [NORP] process is. We are supporting the efforts of the [ORG] group [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]-to assure that democratic elections are used to settle the internal political conflicts and that verified agreements assure peace among the countries. Now, as for [ORG]: There has been important progress in [DATE] achieving democratic ideals, practices, and policy. They are beset by Cuban- and [NORP]-backed insurgents who do not want that kind of government. They want the old-fashioned idea that we have seen for [DATE] the idea that if you have a revolution, it is only to exchange [CARDINAL] set of rules for another set of rulers. For once, we have got a government there that says: No. This is to be revolution to change that process. At the same time that the Government in [GPE] is fighting against this potent enemy on the left, they are being harassed from behind by small violent right-wing groups who want to go back to the old concept of government over the people, not by the people. So, we should not be blaming the present [ORG] of [GPE] for not being able to deal effectively with these rightists when it is beset by this other force on the left. I think that the thing that is dragging this out are the limitations placed on our aid by the [ORG]. It is almost as if they are saying, Well, we will give you just enough to let them bleed to death slowly. What we really need and remember that [CARDINAL] of our aid is for economic and social reforms, and the other [MONEY] out of each dollar is for military aid is the kind of aid that will let them accomplish the job and eliminate this left-wing guerrilla force that is doing the attacking. At the same time, wherever we can, we should help them find out these behind-the-scenes moves by the violent right that we will not accept. And where the government needs help in dealing with this, we should help. That was [CARDINAL] of the missions that Vice President [PERSON] performed when he was in [GPE] recently. I think some progress has been made in that regard. But we should not let the violent right keep us from doing what is necessary to end the war that is going on. And [GPE]-is overthrow of the [NORP] the [GPE] policy? The [INTERVIEWED]. No. We are not demanding the overthrow of that government. All they have to do is go back to the [DATE] democratic commitments they made to the [ORG] as part of the political agreement leading to the end of the [PERSON] regime. Remember, the [GPE] gave them immediate diplomatic recognition and significant financial aid until we found out that one faction of the revolutionaries was exiling or imprisoning their more democratic partners in the revolution, who discovered the [NORP] intended to have a totalitarian form of government. Now, the [NORP]' promises of human rights, of democratic principles, of free elections, union rights, and so forth-all of those promises were made in writing to [ORG] when they persuaded the [ORG], during the revolution, to persuade [PERSON] to resign, which he did. They have not kept that contract. Some of the leaders of the [ORG] were fighting alongside of them in the revolution and then were ousted, just as [PERSON] ousted the same kind of people and imprisoned some of his best lieutenants because they would not go along with him to a [NORP], totalitarian form of government. [GPE] could solve its problem right now. If [ORG] wants to go back to the promises of the revolution, we will step in and help. And what is the sixth issue? It deals with the use of power. [DATE] you spoke of the end of [DATE] of weakness with the rebuilding of [NORP] military power. How do you envision the use of military power in pursuit of this country's foreign policy? Mainly, what we are talking about is deterrence. I have always believed in fact, the [NORP] had this idea [DATE] that your army is really doing its job if it never has to fight. I view it from that standpoint. The [INTERVIEWED]. After [DATE] and [DATE] of unilateral disarming on our side, with this country canceling weapons systems and so forth for domestic political reasons, the [NORP] did not have to give anything up. I think it was all explained in my favorite cartoon. It was the cartoon that portrayed [PERSON] when he was still alive, and it had him talking to a [NORP] general. [PERSON] said, I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it. Now, the [NORP] have found out they are facing a belated [GPE] modernization program which will assure the effectiveness of our deterrent. I think that is the only reason they came to the table to discuss arms reductions. They have come to realize that we will do whatever is necessary to make it evident that hostile moves on their part would result in equal or greater punishment to them. That is the purpose of our military buildup, and it certainly worked in [GPE].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmastersergeanterinrobertsthepentagonchannel", "text": "About Search Sir, I want to thank you for this opportunity that you have given us to talk to you. My honor. [DATE] is the [DATE] anniversary of [GPE] military presence in [GPE]. And my first question for you would be, as Commander in Chief, what are the areas you are most focused on and most proud of as [GPE] forces and the [NORP] forces continue to work towards stability and security in [GPE]? I am most proud of the performance of our troops. We have asked a lot of our military and the military families. We have got men and women who have been to both theaters in the war on terror, multiple times. And that is a strain, and it is hard. And I understand it is. On the other hand, our troops know it is necessary. I am focused on making sure that we do not allow the sacrifice that has gone over [DATE] to go in vain; that we end up making the hard decisions now, and helping the [NORP] now to develop a peaceful and free society in the heart of the Middle East, which will enable the next generation's children to grow up in a peaceful world or the next generation to grow up in a peaceful world. And so I am pleased with the progress. It is been hard; it is been really hard. It is been hard on our country. It is been hard on the military, but I am proud of the fact that the military has been so steadfast and courageous. Speaking of the military and their families, you meet with many family members, many spouses, on a regular basis. Yes. of those that are lost and wounded in the conflicts difficult situation, I am sure. Could you take [TIME] and just tell us what it is like meeting with them and what you say to them and what they say to you? Sure. First of all, obviously, each circumstance is a little different. And you are right, I have met with a lot. Let me first start with the wounded. Generally what happens is, is that, in a place like [FAC] or [FAC], you know, a soldier will look at their Commander in Chief and say, I cannot wait to get back in the battle, which obviously you know, first of all, it is just so inspiring to me, but it also it is got to change the perspective of their family a little bit. Secondly, with the wounded, I am obviously always conscious to make sure that these kids, these soldiers people in uniform get the best care. And I truly believe they are. And I love our doctors and nurses. It is unbelievable the care they get. In terms of meeting with the families of the deceased as you can imagine, it is very emotional. First of all, meeting the [INTERVIEWED] alone can be an emotional experience, and when you put on top of that the Commander in Chief who made the decision of that got their child in a position where he or she got killed, so, you know, the meetings can be very tearful. I am a crier, at times. I am not afraid to hug a mom or hug a wife or hug a husband and cry. I try to get them to talk about their loved one. I want to learn about each individual person who sacrificed what they were like, what their interests were and a lot of times the families love sharing their stories with the Commander in Chief. And to a person, nearly, I have been told that, Whatever you do, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], complete this job. Do not and basically what they are saying is, Do not let politics, do not let the [ORG] poll, do not let a focus group cause you to make a decision that is not in the best interests of our country and our military. And I assure them that they do not have to worry about that about [INTERVIEWED]. I tell my friends who ask me this question a lot, what they say: What is it like? You are the guy who made the decision to put their loved one in harm's way. They did not come home. What is it like to meet with them? And I say that oftentimes the comforter in chief is the person who gets comforted, because of the strength and courage and great love of country of these folks. Let us move to [GPE]. It is been [DATE] Right. since we forced the [ORG] out of power over there. What do you see the current situation for our troops right now, and how much work do you think needs to be done to sustain the progress that we have made? [GPE] obviously is different from [GPE]. [NORP] I mean, [GPE] is a wealthier nation. [GPE] is broke, and they had a long way to go and from [DATE] of the [ORG], and, you know, they have made interesting progress. I am going to get some of these statistics a little wrong, but the point I want to make is that infrastructures change. I mean, it is I think there was like [QUANTITY] of roads, and [DATE], there is [QUANTITY] of road. Young girls were not going to school, basically, and now there is a lot of young girls going to school. Health care was very rudimentary, and [DATE], a lot of people have got basic health care. In other words, the condition human condition is changing, which is important. The [ORG] has not been defeated. In other words, they keep coming back. And an enemy such as this gets defeated when [CARDINAL] things happen: [CARDINAL], you know, we bring their people to justice, as well as a society develops which marginalizes themin other words, something that competes with their ideology. Everybody in [GPE] knows what the [ORG]'s ideology is like. They had to live under them. And now that we are trying to help them realize there is another way and a more hopeful life. And until a you know, a civil society develops that provides hope for the [NORP] people, it is going to be the [ORG] will be a factor. And so they are a factor now. Are they winning? No, they are not winning. Can they beat us militarily? Absolutely not. And so a lot of what and we are bolstering our troops there, by the way, just to make sure that they are not able to intimidate the people to the point where a civil society and a free society cannot develop. So we have got work to do there. The good news is we are not in there alone. There is a lot of [ORG] troops some of whom fight, some of whom do not fight, but all of whom make a contribution. And I am going to [ORG] [DATE] and the [ORG] meeting in [GPE]. And I will , of course, be urging our allies to bolster their presence in [GPE] because and I will remind them that this was the country that had failed so miserably, that not only were people brutalized, but an enemy that hates [GPE] and hates free societies developed safe havens from which they launch brutal attack. And now is the time to deal with them and not hope they change their mind or hope they become better citizens of the world, because they are not. [GPE] Yes. the new [ORG]; you just were on a trip to [CARDINAL] countries in Africa. Tell me, if you can, briefly, the significance of [ORG], and strategically and how it will play in the global war on terror. Well, first of all, there is some nervousness about the [NORP] command in Africa because nations do not want [GPE] troops stationed on their border. And so I had to spend time saying, wait [TIME], this is not a typical command. What this is, is a command that will help [NORP] deal with [NORP] problems, such as [GPE]. We want well-trained [NORP] troops going into places like [GPE], helping the poor folks there who are being brutalized by, you know, thugs, to be able to survive and thrive. And first of all, this administration recognizes that Africa is important. That is why we name an [NORP] command. Secondly, that hopelessness is the only way radicals can recruit, and therefore, we have programs to, you know, deal with malaria and HIV/AIDS and hunger. But the other source of instability on the continent of Africa is civil unrest, is civil war, is, you know, inflamed passions that break out into violence. And it is in our interests that we help [NORP] deal with those problems. That is what [ORG] is meant to do. And so it fits into the broader scope of things, the broader war on terror, and also it is a commitment that we care about the people on the continent of Africa.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattfreibbcworldnewsamerica", "text": "About Search [INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to Africa Mr. [INTERVIEWED] thanks for joining us. You are famous for saying that you do not believe in opinion polls. Yes. Do you have any idea how you rate in the countries that you are going to be visiting in Africa? No, sir, I do not . Well, I have got news for you, and it is good news. You rate pretty well, sort of in [DATE]. Is that [CARDINAL] of the reasons why you are going there? This is [CARDINAL] part of the world where you are still very popular. I go where needed. And no, I am going there because I have got a firm, heartfelt commitment to the continent of Africa and had ever since I became [INTERVIEWED]. It is in our interests, national interests, that we help people who are suffering from disease and hunger and hopelessness. The only way a radical can recruit is to find somebody that is hopeless. I mean, their vision is, like, really dark and dim. Plus, I believe to whom much is given, much is required. And [GPE] has been given a lot, and it is required of us to help those who suffer. So mine is a mercy a mission of mercy and a mission of the cold realism of the world in which we live-based upon the realism in the world in which we live. Your administration has given [MONEY] to treat AIDS in Africa, which is an unprecedented amount of money, and you want to double that amount yet again. This is a huge commitment, and yet the administration and you, personally, do not seem to be getting a lot of credit for it. Yes. You know, this is kind of tied to your first question about polls. Polls are nothing more than just, like, a poof of air. What matters is results. And ultimately, people will be able to make an objective judgment of a [INTERVIEWED] and his administration and, in this case, a country's commitment. And so all I care, really, about is the results of the programs. I hope by now people have learned that I am not one of these guys that really gives a darn about elite opinion. What I really care about is, are we saving lives? And in this case, we are. As I mentioned in my speech that you kindly listened to, when I first went to sub-Sahara Africa, [CARDINAL] people were receiving antiretrovirals; [DATE], [CARDINAL]. And that is a lot in a very quick period of time. But there is still so much more suffering, and that is why I have called for a doubling of aid. The good news is, it is not just [GPE]. As I mentioned in my speech, the G-8 nations also are supporting this very important initiative. And, you know, it is just in other words, this is not a paternalistic effort, this is an effort of mercy. But it has made a huge difference, has not it? So why not take some credit for it? Because it is just not my nature. I really you just got to understand about me: I am more interested in seeing results and sharing the credit with the [NORP] people. I mean, this is not a [INTERVIEWED] effort. I just happen to be the leader of a nation that is willing to fund this kind of money. And so I praised [ORG] in my speech; I praised the [NORP] people in my speech. After all, they are the ones who are funding the effort. You were very tough in your speech about [GPE], and yet again, you called what is happening there genocide. Yes. Is enough being done by your administration to stop that? I think we are, yes. You know, I had to make a seminal decision, and that is whether or not I would commit troops into [GPE] troops into [GPE]. And I was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in [GPE] that care deeply about the issue. And so once you make that decision, then you have to rely upon an international organization like [ORG] to provide the oomph, the necessary manpower. And in my speech [DATE], I did call it genocide again. I think we are the only nation that has done so. Secondly, I did remind people that we are sanctioning leaders, that we have targeted [NORP] companies and individuals, including a rebel leader who have yet to be constructive in the peace process. We are beginning to get a sense that these sanctions are affecting behavior. We are trying to ask others, by the way, to do the same thing, some of whom are reluctant, some who are not . And then, finally, I pledged that we will help move troops in. And as I also said you might remind your listeners that I am frustrated by the pace. I will get onto that in [TIME], but, I mean, genocide is such a loaded it is such an important word. And you have committed troops, [NORP] troops, around the world in other cases, [GPE], most famously, [GPE]. Why not in this case? Well, that is a good question. I mean, we are committing equipment, training, help, movement. I think a lot of the folks were concerned about [GPE] into another [NORP] country. Some of the relief groups here just did not think the strategy would be as effective as it was. I mean, I actually, believe it or not, listen to people's opinions and chose to make this decision. It is a decision that I am now living with, and it is a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world and get people to focus on the issue. You know, you are right. I mean, we sent marines into [GPE], for example, to help stabilize the country there. And [GPE]'s on my itinerary, where I will meet with the first woman elected President in Africa's history. But I just made the decision I made. [DATE] [PERSON], the [GPE] director, pulled out of the Beijing Olympics over [GPE]. He said the [NORP] are not doing enough to stop the killing in [GPE]. Yes. Do you applaud his move? That is up to him. I am going to the Olympics. I view the Olympics as a sporting event. On the other hand, I have a little different platform than [PERSON], so I get to talk to President [PERSON]. And I do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in [GPE]. There is a lot of issues that I suspect people are going to opine about during the Olympics. I mean, you got the [PERSON] crowd; you have got global warming folks; you have got [GPE]. And I just I am not going to go and use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the [NORP] people in a public way because I do it all the time with I mean, so people are going to be able to choose pick and choose how they view the Olympics. The [NORP] Government has been saying, in part in response to this, that [GPE] is trapped in cold war thinking. Well, I think that is just a brush-back pitch, as we say in baseball. It is a [GPE] is trapped in this notion that we care about human life; we respect human dignity and that is not a trap; that is a belief and that many of us in this country recognize that the human condition matters to our own national security. See, I happen to believe we are in an ideological struggle. And those who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives are evil people, but they have an ideology. And the only way you can recruit for that ideology is to find hopeless folks. I mean, who wants to join an ideology that say: women do not have rights; you cannot express yourself freely; religious beliefs are the only religious belief you can hold is the one we tell you. And, oh, by the way, it is great; you can be a suicider. Hopeless people are the ones who get attracted by that point of view. And therefore, it is in the world's interest, from a national security perspective, to deal with hopelessness. And it happens to be in our moral interest. I repeat to you: I believe to whom much is given, much is required. It happens to be a religious notion, but it should be a universal notion as well. And I believe [GPE]'s soul is enriched, our spirit is enhanced when we help people who suffer. I mentioned the genocide thing also because your predecessor, President [PERSON], said that the [CARDINAL] thing [CARDINAL] of the key things that keeps him up at [TIME] is that he did not do enough over [GPE] to stop the killing there. Is it possible that [GPE] might become your [GPE]? I do not think so. I hope I certainly hope not. I mean, [GPE] was, I think, [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people in a very quick period of time of just wholesale slaughter. And I appreciate President [PERSON]'s compassion and concern. And I am comfortable with making a decision that I think is the best decision and comfortable with the notion that once that decision is made, we are keeping the world's focus as best as we can on that, amongst other issues. You also had some very strong language [DATE] about [GPE]. Yes, I did. which is an issue that certain [GPE] and [GPE] care deeply about. Again, this has been going on for [DATE]. What can be done to stop the crisis in [GPE]? Yes, I first is call the is to speak to the conscience of the world and remind people the facts. I mean, [GPE] was the breadbasket of southern Africa, and [DATE], it is in line for food aid. [GPE] was a is now a place where people are repressed because of their beliefs. And you are right; there is not a lot of outcry. And it is a frustrating look, not everything is perfect in this world, and it just requires constant focus. And [CARDINAL] way to do it is for the [NORP] President to speak out or the [NORP] Prime Minister to speak out. And, as you know, I mentioned [GPE]. I have great respect for the people of [GPE]. I just happen to believe their Government can do more to enhance a free society in their region. Yes, it is just there is a lot of frustrations in this world, and there is a lot of hope in this world as well. You are nearing the end of your second term and, I guess, one can call is legacy time. Whatever you do and say about Africa, there is [CARDINAL] country, really, that the wider world will associate with you, and that equation is, [INTERVIEWED] equals [GPE]. Yes. Are you happy about that? Well, I mean, that is what the current elite would like everybody to think about, and that is fine. I think history will have a when history marches on, there will be a little more objective look about the totality of this administration. Of course, our change in the way we did aid in Africa is substantial and different, and lives will have been saved. Being the first [INTERVIEWED] to propose a [CARDINAL]-state solution on [GPE] and [GPE] I mean, there is a lot of other issues. And I am happy with [GPE]. The right the decision to move [PERSON] was right, and this democracy is now taking root. And I am confident that if [GPE] does not become isolationist and allow the terrorists to take back over, [GPE] will succeed. Are you-do you regret, rather, I should say, that you did not listen to your-some of your commanders earlier to send more troops to [GPE] to achieve the kind of results that we are seeing now to some extent? You know, my commanders did not tell me that early. My commanders said, we got the right level of troops. You know, wars it is easy to second the tactical decisions of war, and I fully understand and expect that to happen. All I can do is base decisions on the considered judgment of the experts. And I did. And I take full responsibility for every military decision that is been made in [GPE]. But I am pleased with what is happening now. And the world is beginning to recognize that the decision to send more troops was a pretty tough decision at the time is providing enough security for the politics to take place. And [TIME] you are the first reporter I have been able to describe these conversations to, but I did speak to the Prime Minister, the Speaker, and [CARDINAL] Deputy Speakers to congratulate them on a series of substantial legislative achievements that are beginning to say to the world and, more importantly, the [NORP] people, reconciliation is happening, and the legislative body is beginning to function, which is good news. The [ORG] [DATE] passed a bill outlawing waterboarding. You, I believe, have said that you will veto that bill. Does that not send the wrong signal to the rest of the world? No, look, that is not the reason I am vetoing the bill. The reason I am vetoing the bill first of all, we have said that whatever we do is for legal will be legal. Secondly, they are imposing a set of standards on our intelligence communities, in terms of interrogating prisoners, that our people will think will be ineffective. And to the critics, I ask them this: When we, within the law, interrogate and get information that protects ourselves and possibly others and other nations to prevent attacks which attack would they had hoped that we would not have prevented? And so [GPE] will act within the law, and we will make sure our professionals have the tools necessary to do their job within the law. Now, I recognize some say that these terrorists really are not that big a threat to [GPE] anymore. I fully disagree. And I think the President must give these professionals, within the law, the necessary tools to protect us. So we are having a debate not only on how you interrogate people; we are having a debate in [GPE] on whether or not we ought to be listening to terrorists making phone calls in [GPE]. And the answer is, darn right we ought to be. But given [FAC], given also [FAC], given renditions, does this not send the wrong signal to the world? It should send the signal that [GPE] is going to respect law but is going to take actions necessary to protect ourselves and find information that may protect others. Unless, of course, people say: Well, there is no threat. They are just making up the threat. These people are not problematic. But I do not see how you can say that in [GPE], after people came and blew up bombs in subways. I suspect the families of those victims understand the nature of killers. And so what people got to understand is, we will make decisions based upon law. We are a nation of law. Take [FAC], look, I'd like it to be empty. On the other hand, there is some people there that need to be tried. And there will be a trial, and they will have their day in court, unlike what they did to other people. No, there is great concern about and I can understand this that these people be given rights, but they are not willing to grant the same rights to others. They will murder, but you got to understand, they are getting rights. And I am comfortable with the decisions we have made, and I am comfortable with recognizing this is still a dangerous world. Can you honestly say, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] that [DATE], [GPE] still occupies the moral high ground? Absolutely. Absolutely. We believe in human rights and human dignity. We believe in the human condition. We believe in freedom. And we are willing to take the lead; we are willing to ask nations to do hard things; we are willing to accept responsibilities. And yes, no question in my mind, this is a nation that is a force for good. And history will judge the decisions made during this period of time as necessary decisions. And I firmly believe that we are laying the foundation for peace. People have written off the Middle East it is impossible to have change the conditions there; let us just ignore it, or let us promote stability, which was part of the foreign policy of the past. I chose a different course. Stability did not work. Stability created the conditions that were ripe for these terrorists to emerge and recruit. I happen to believe free societies provide hope. And I would hope that people in Europe, for example, understand that freedom has led to peace and ought to be supporting the freedom movements and not shy away from the responsibility of the comfortable to help those who long for freedom. And it is hard work. It is really hard work, and it does not happen instantly. You know, we live in a world like, in all due respect to [TIME] news, we live in a world where everything is, like, instant. But the work we are doing is it takes patience, but most importantly, it takes faith in the universality of freedom that exists in every heart. And so yes, I am not only happy to defend decisions, I am confident that they will lead to a better [DATE]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED] I gather we have run out of time. Thanks for doing this. Thank you, sir. You bet. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}

Both teams have have their weaknesses. They are not as strong as they were uh I think, [DATE]. When you look at the [ORG], their defense is a little shaky. Uh, the [ORG] have just come back. So I cannot , I cannot tell you who is gonna win this one. Little history for you. OK, [DATE] when the [ORG] were in it, they won it. [PERSON] went on to become president of [GPE]. [DATE], the [ORG] were in it, they lost it to the [ORG], a guy named [INTERVIEWED] went on to become [INTERVIEWED], so who do you do you want to win [DATE]? You are not gonna get me. You are not gonna get me. I am gonna look for a great game. What about the ladies in the [INTERVIEWED] household, do they feel about [PERSON] the same way ladies all around the country feel about this guy? I think they know he is a good lookin guy, there is no doubt about it. Is there perhaps a poster of [PERSON] somewhere in [FAC]? You know they have not . . the girls [DATE], [DATE]; they are not quite of the age yet where they start to uh putting up the pictures of guys yet. Uh, [PERSON] maybe. When that happens, I will uh, I, I may, you know, call some executive privileges and say that is not appropriate. Let us change subjects a little bit because there are a lot of other headlines I'd like to ask you about, one in particular seems to be building tension between [GPE] and [GPE]. It seems now the [NORP]'s are signaling that they may act and conduct a strike inside [GPE] at their nuclear sites, sooner than later. Do they have your full support for that raid? I do not think that [GPE] has made a decision on what they need to do. I think they, like us, believe that [GPE] has to stand down on its nuclear weapons program. And we have mobilized the international community in a way that is unprecedented. And they are feeling the pinch. They are feeling the pressure, but they have not taken the step that they need to, diplomatically, which is to say, We will pursue peaceful nuclear power. We will not pursue a nuclear weapon. Until they do, I think [GPE] rightly is going to be uh very concerned, and we are as well. Has [GPE] promised you that they would give you advanced warning to any such attack should they give you that warning? You know I will not go into the details of our conversations. I will say that we have closer military and intelligence consultation between our [CARDINAL] countries than we ever have. And my number [CARDINAL] priority continues to be the security of [GPE] but also the security of [GPE]. And we are gonna make sure that we work in lock step, as we proceed to try to solve this, hopefully diplomatically. When you talk about the security of [GPE], [GPE] has had a long time to contemplate how they might respond to such an attack. Do you fear that they will wage attacks within [GPE] on [NORP] soil? You know, we do not see any evidence that they have those intentions or capabilities right now. And again, our goal is to resolve this issue diplomatically, that would be preferable. But we are not going to take any options off the table, though. Obviously any kind of uh additional uh military activity inside the Gulf is disruptive and has a big effect on us. It could have a bit effect on oil prices. We have still got troops in [GPE], which borders [GPE]. And so our preferred solution here is diplomatic. We are going to keep on pushing on that front, but we are not gonna take any options off the table. And I have been very clear, that we are gonna do everything we can to prevent [GPE] from getting a nuclear weapon and creating an arms race, a nuclear arm race, in a volatile region. [DATE] we sat for this interview on Superbowl Sunday. You had been [INTERVIEWED] for [DATE], and we talked about the state of the economy which was in dire straits, and you said this to me, quote if I do not have this done in [DATE], then it is going to be a [CARDINAL]-term proposition. You got good news on [DATE] in terms of jobs. The unemployment rate went down to [PERCENT]. But I think if you go out on the street and you ask average [NORP] is the recovery done, overwhelmingly they will tell you it is not. So do you deserve a second term? I deserve a second term, but we are not done. Look, when you and I sat down, we were losing [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs a month. In fact we had found out [DATE] before we sat down that we'd lost, [DATE], [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs. Now we are creating [CARDINAL][CARDINAL]. We have created [CARDINAL] jobs over [DATE]. We have created the most jobs since [DATE], the most manufacturing jobs since [DATE], but we are not finished. And we have got to not only boost up [NORP] manufacturing, so that not just the auto industry but all [NORP] manufacturing is building again and selling overseas. We have got to make sure that we are pushing [NORP] energy. And that includes not just oil and gas but clean energy. We have got to make sure that the skills of [NORP] workers are the best in the world, and we are making progress on that front. And we have got to return to old-fashioned [NORP] values--everybody getting a fair shot, everybody doing their fair share, everybody playin by the same rules. And that means, for example, regulations to make sure that Wall Street is followin the same rules that Main Street is doin. But we have made progress, and the key right now is just to make sure we do not start turning in a new direction that could throw that progress off. We have got a lot more to talk about. You have been kind enough to say that we can stick around here and we will tape something that people will see [DATE] [TIME] on the Today Show. [INTERVIEWED], enjoy the game. Thanks very much. I hope everybody has a great Super Bowl. It is gonna be a great game. All right. We are going to be back with the countdown to SuperBowl 46 from [GPE] right after this. I asked [INTERVIEWED] if he was satisfied with [GPE] and the [ORG] on their nuclear ambitions. I think we have a very good estimate of when they could potentially achieve breakout capacity, what stage they are at in terms of processing uranium. But do we know all the dynamics inside of [GPE]? Absolutely not. And I think that one of the difficulties is is that [GPE] is a lot more divided now than it was. Knowing who is making decisions at any given time inside [GPE] is tough, but we do have a pretty good bead on what is happening with the nuclear program. One of the things we do know, I would imagine, is that they are conducting a lot of this research and development far underground. And I understand [GPE] is in the process of developing the next generation of bunkerbusting bombs that can go far beneath the surface and take a site like that out. Will those bombs be ready in time? Would you use them, unilaterally, against those sites. [PERSON], I am not going to discuss specific military programs or go into details in terms of what our planning is. I will say this, that uh, we have done extensive planning over [DATE] about all our various options uh in the Gulf, and, uh, we are prepared to exercise these options should they, should the need arise. But, my goal is to try to resolve this diplomatically mainly because the only way over the long term we can assure [GPE] does not get a nuclear weapon is by getting them to understand it is not in their interest. Let us talk about domestic politics. [PERSON] is a guy who is running for your job. He may eventually become the nominee. He is a guy who is been incredibly successful in his life and career. He is made a lot of money. It is not a crime. It is part of the [NORP] dream. Absolutely. Do you think, though, that [PERSON] can identify with the middle class and the underclass in this country? Well, you know, I am not going to comment on any particular candidate until they decide who it is. . .the [NORP] decide who their nominee's gonna be. I think most people are thinking the election's [DATE] away - the last thing we need is to start it right now when the other side has not determined its nominee. But I do think the vast majority of the [NORP] people understand, we want everybody to be successful, and nobody begrudges people who've been successful because they are making things, creating new products, new services. That is the [NORP] way. But, what people also wanna see is that everybody is doin their fair share; we are all pulling together. That we are creating ladders of opportunity for all [NORP]. Whoever the [NORP] nominee is, I fundamentally disagree with a formula that would go back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. This idea, this idea of being able to reach out and connect to the middle class and having the middle class reach out to a political candidate. Right. On [DATE] you held a fundraiser. Right. You raised $[MONEY], 000 in [TIME], I think. [CARDINAL] wealth individuals paid $[MONEY], 000 apiece to spend [TIME] with you. Yeah. How do you think the guy sitting drinking a beer and eating chips watching the game [DATE] can identify with something like that? Right. Well I think, [PERSON], if you uh if you noticed uh [DATE] I also had lunch with [CARDINAL] folks who had given [MONEY] each who were part of this huge base of supporters we have all across this country. And it is precisely because we have been able to create a grassroots movement that I was successful in [DATE] and I, uh, I think we will be successful this time. Now if you ask me would I love to take some of the big money out of politics, I would. Unfortunately, right now, partly because of [ORG] rulings and a bunch of decisions out there, it is very hard to be able to get your message out without some resources. : Maybe the better question is how will you spend the money. And by all accounts you have raised a lot of money for this campaign, some people say [MONEY]. We have just seen in [GPE] on the [NORP] side a lot of money spent, [PERCENT] of it spent on extremely negative personal ads. If you raise [MONEY] to keep this job, can we expect the same kind of negativity coming from that money? What I can tell you is that in [DATE], part of the reason that we were successful is that we ran an affirmative campaign about my vision for where Am. . [GPE] should go. And I think what [NORP] s want to hear more than anything else is how are you gonna help me right now? If they are hearing a persuasive argument, about how we are gonna recreate a solid path for middle-class success in this country, then I think I will win regardless of the negative ads coming out. : And to that end, now this may sound like a little bit [PERSON], [INTERVIEWED], Right. But when the [NORP] nominee is chosen would you agree to meeting with that person, whether it is Governor [PERSON] or Speaker [PERSON], or whoever, and getting together with that person and talking about how the [CARDINAL] of you plan to conduct yourselves over the course of this campaign. I think the [NORP] people would like that. Would you agree to that? You, you know, I think that uh you will be able to see how we conduct ourselves in the campaign. I think it will be consistent with how I conducted myself in [DATE] and hopefully how I have conducted myself as [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. I, uh, one of the worries we have obviously in the next campaign, is that there are so many of these so-called super-pacs, these independent expenditures that are going to be out there, uh, there is going to be just a lot of money floating around. And I guarantee you a bunch of that is going to be negative. But it is not gonna be enough just to say the other guy's a bum. You have got to explain to the [NORP] people what your plan is to make sure that there are good jobs at good wages and that this economy is growing over the long term. Whoever wins that argument I think is going to be the next [INTERVIEWED]. Which leads me well into this next question because I have talked to so many people over [DATE], [INTERVIEWED], who were huge supporters of yours back in [DATE]. And [DATE] they are not sure. I hear more and more that they are disappointed in you. That you are not the transformational political figure that they hoped you would be. How does that make you feel when you hear that? Oh I, you know I think this is the nature of being. What is frustrated people is is that I have not been able to force [ORG] to implement every aspect of what I uh said in [DATE]. Well, it turns out uh that our Founders designed a system that makes it more difficult to bring about change than I would like sometimes. But what we have been able to do is move in the right direction. And what I am going to just keep on doing is plodding away, very persistent. And, you know what? Uh, one of the things about being [INTERVIEWED] is you get better as time goes on. Why though should a voter look and say, look he was not able to fix [GPE], which is a big job for any [CARDINAL] man. Perhaps there is more gridlock and more divisiveness in [GPE] now than there ever has been in the past. Why will he be able to do it in [DATE], and if he cannot do it, is not nothing going to get done? Even with a bunch of uh obstruction over uh on, uh, [ORG], we have been able to save an auto industry. We have been able to take [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs being lost a month and move it so that it is [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs being created [DATE]. We have been able to make sure that we ended uh the War in Iraq on schedule. We have been able to make sure that we ended policies like do not ask, do not tell. So we have been able to get a lot done. Not as fast as we want. Sometimes it is messy; the process is frustrating. I do think that this is going to be a critical election because uh, having yanked ourselves out of the risk of a great depression; having stabilized the economy; we now have a broader question which is how do we take it to the next level. And I think whoever comes in, both in [ORG] and in [ORG], is going to have to uh take a strong message from the [NORP] people about which direction to go. And I think that will allow us to make more progress over [DATE]. I said at the time with respect to [GPE] that we would be making these decisions uh on a case-by-case basis based on how unified the international community was, what our capacities were. Uh, but we have been relentless in sending a message that is time for [PERSON] to go, that the kind of violence that we have seen exercised against his own people over [DATE] and over [DATE], is inexcusable. But uh not every situation is going to allow for the kind of military solution that we saw . . . But would you consider military action with our allies without [ORG] approval, especially considering that [GPE] and [GPE] vetoed this latest resolution at the [ORG]? It is important for us to try to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention and I think that is possible. My sense is you are seeing more and more people inside of [GPE] recognizing that they need to turn a chapter and the [PERSON] regime is feeling the noose tightening around them. We are gonna just continue to put more and more pressure until hopefully we see a transition. This is not going to be a matter of if; it is going to be a matter of when. Here we sit on Super Bowl [DATE]. There is the cover of [ORG], the most recent [ORG], and it has a picture of you watching the big game on TV. And there you are sitting there and up on screen it is not the [ORG] and the [ORG]. It is [PERSON] and [PERSON], same team, and they are pummeling each other. And look at the smile on your face there. Is art imitating life here? Well, you know, uh, look, I have been through these primaries, they are tough. You know, I think... But does this help you? You know, I think ultimately this will be forgotten by the time they make a decision on who their nominee is. And the [NORP] people are going to make a decision on my platform and where I want to take the country and where the [NORP] does. A lot of this stuff is good for selling newspapers and boosting ratings on TV, but I think in the end what they are going to be asking a question about is not the horse race. They are going to be asking, How is this going to help me in my life? And finally on a personal note, [INTERVIEWED] wifegave an interview recently reacting to something that was written about her in a recent book, where she said that, you know, the image that has been out there since you decided to run for [INTERVIEWED] was she was some kind of angry black woman. And she said, That is not me. And the way to fight it is just go out there and be me and hopefully people will judge me based on me. Right Taking the fact that you are [INTERVIEWED] out of it, as a husband, how does it make you feel when she is forced to address something that is clearly a characterization that upsets her? You know, uh, as a husband, one of the things - and a father, one of the things that is toughest for me is that my family gets brought into the political realm, which is not always very pleasant. And, you know, that weighs on me. Having said that, [PERSON] has been as good a first lady as I think anybody can imagine. And, when I watch her making a difference all across the country in terms of changing how kids are getting exercise and eating, and the passion she brings to the military families, uh I could not be prouder of her. I, I think she had some reservations about taking on this whole process going on this journey at the beginning of it and she is admitted that. She is talked about it. She is turned out to be really good, so- Is she ready for [DATE]? Well, I think she is. Because she thinks, uh, that the work is really important. And I think even those folks who wish that I was doing more of this or more of that or questioning me on these policies or those policies, when you ask them about [PERSON], they give her a thumbs-up, and rightfully so. That is[INTERVIEWED].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday", "text": "About Search INTERVIEWER1: We begin on a [DATE] [TIME] with the disaster in the Gulf, now in [DATE], and our exclusive interview with [INTERVIEWED]. We sat down on [DATE] before his commencement speech at a high school in [GPE], [GPE]. And I began by asking [INTERVIEWED] if the oil spill in the Gulf has made this the toughest point in his [INTERVIEWED] to date. This is tough, no doubt about it, because, you know, when you watch television or you go down to the Gulf and you see birds covered in oil and you talk to fishermen who are on the verge of tears big, tough guys, but, you know, their livelihoods are being smothered by this oil that is coming into the estuaries and marshes it gets you frustrated. Do you feel at this stage, [DATE] or so into this, that your administration has been damaged by this oil spill? No. First of all, I am not concerned about my politics right now. What I am concerned about is what is happening down in the Gulf. And I guarantee you, the folks in the Gulf have been damaged by this oil spill. And livelihoods are at stake. This is the largest federal response to an environmental disaster in history. From [DATE], we understood that this was going to be a major disaster. We have put unprecedented resources to deal with it. Then why do you think there is so much frustration aimed not only at [ORG] right now but at your administration? There are people who are starting to wonder out loud if the oil spill in the Gulf could be could do to you what Katrina did to President [PERSON] or even what the [GPE] hostage situation did to [PERSON]. You know, I have to tell you, some of this is just the nature of the [TIME] news cycle. You have got a camera showing oil spilling out in the Gulf, and people are understandably frustrated and they are upset, and they have every right to be. But here is what I can say, that we have responded with unprecedented resources. And when you look at what most of the critics say, [PERSON], and you ask them, Well, specifically what is it that the administration could or should have done differently that would have an impact on whether or not oil was hitting the shore? you are met with silence. And the fact of the matter is there has not been an idea that is mentioned out there by any of the critics that we have not evaluated. And if it was going to work, we would have done it. But it happened under my watch that you still had these oil rigs out there that we thought could deal with this kind of situation and they have not been able to deal with it. A day or so after that oil rig sank Right. I spoke to Rear Admiral [PERSON] of [ORG] Yeah. who was speaking on behalf of the administration. And I asked her Right. I said, We are seeing an oil slick in the water. Where is that coming from? And she said, There is no evidence that that is coming from this wellhead. That is residual oil coming from the rig itself. Right. [DATE], she echoed those same comments. Right. Was the administration misled, in your opinion? Were you relying too much on information from [ORG]? And from the start, did [ORG] try to downplay the situation? Well, here is what I think happened. Initially the thinking was that, in fact, the rig had sunk but the blowout preventers had shut down the well, because that is what they were supposed to do. So the anticipation was maybe a thousand barrels might be leaking a day, but this is not going to be a monumental spill. As soon as people understood that the blowout preventers were not working, that the valves that were supposed to shut down in the event of a blowout like this had not functioned properly, then I think people understood right then that this was going to be a significant emergency. Have you spoken directly to [PERSON], the CEO of [ORG]? I have not spoken to him directly, and here is the reason, because my experience is when you talk to a guy like a [ORG] CEO, he is going to say all the right things to me. I am not interested in words. I am interested in actions. I And we are communicating to him [DATE] exactly what we expect of him and what we expect of that administration. In all due respect, that feels strange to me; that here we have got the CEO of a company that is responsible for the worst environmental disaster in [GPE] history, and I think I am just curious why you did not pick up you would not pick up the phone and in some ways just give him a piece of your mind. Well, the look, this has sort of been this has been the main critique of the administration is giving a piece of my mind to these guys. Look, I would love to vent. I would love to just shout and holler, because I am thinking about this day in and day out. But my main job is to solve the problem. To solve the problem, you have to have a reliable partner. Let me read you some of the things that Mr. [PERSON] has said over the course of this disaster. He said, The Gulf of Mexico is a big ocean. The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume. The environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very, very modest. And then he said, There is no one who wants this to end more than I do. I'd like my life back. Yeah. Well, I think The family members of those [CARDINAL] people who died on the rig and the people whose lives are going to be changed for [DATE] want their lives back too. He does not work for you. But if he did, would you want him out? He would not be working for me after any of those statements. First of all, we are going to have to find out why this thing went in the first place. And the fact of the matter is that there is going to be a thorough review. And I do not want to prejudge it, but the initial reports indicate that there may be situations in which not only human error was involved, but you also saw some corner cutting in terms of safety, and that [ORG] is a [MONEY] corporation. It is talking about paying [MONEY] in dividends just for [DATE]. Right. We are going to have to make sure that not only do they shut down the cap, we are not only going to have to make sure that any deepwater drilling process that is out there is, in fact, fail-safe and oil companies know what they are doing, but we also have to make sure that every single person who is been affected by this is properly compensated and made whole. When I went down there [DATE] Can [ORG] do that? Can they do all that? Absolutely. They can afford it. If I start seeing [ORG] nickel and diming folks down there, then they are going to have to answer to us. We have heard time and time again throughout this crisis, as [ORG] has tried and failed with all their fixes, that this technology is untested at this depth. Yeah. And it just raises a question. If this is where we are drilling for oil, at [QUANTITY] under the surface of the ocean, where is the oversight in that? Why are they allowed to drill there if the worst-case-scenario methods to prevent disaster are untested at that depth? It does not help to test them at [QUANTITY]. When it comes to how we were operating in overseeing and taking the word of the oil industry generally, not just [ORG] in terms of the fail-safe nature of what they could do, I think we have to completely review that. And that is why I have assigned this bipartisan commission. I want them to report back to me, because you obviously cannot take the word of oil companies when they say they have got a bunch of redundancy and backup plans, when something like this happens and it turns out they have no idea what they are doing. So even as the oil is spewing into the Gulf, would you consider halting all drilling below a certain depth right now? Well, keep in mind what is happening. First of all, there is we have already instituted a moratorium On new drilling. -- on new drilling. The production wells that are already pumping oil, those do not seem to be the problem. The problem has to do with actually drilling and starting a new well. So we have put a moratorium on new wells. Shallow wells are not a problem because the risers essentially come up above the water. So if something like this happened in a shallow-water well, then folks would just get up on the platform and they would start fixing it and it would be shut down fairly quickly. Right. -- that we can actually handle a crisis like this. Have you allowed yourself to even imagine what the Gulf region will look like if oil continues to spew until [DATE], what it will smell like, what the economic situation will be like down there? I have. And here is what I will say. This is going to be a mess. It already is. But I have been down there, and the people are resilient, and these ecosystems are more resilient than I think we anticipate right now, if we act swiftly, if we act seriously. There are going to be marshes, for example, where the oil goes in and the sea life that is there is decimated for [DATE] maybe [CARDINAL]. But potentially we can preserve those estuaries and those marshes so that [DATE] things have come back; things have bounced back. Critics are now talking about your style, which is the first time I have heard that in a long time. And they are saying here is a guy who likes to be known as cool and calm and collected, and this is not the time for cool, calm and collected -- Right. -- that this is not the time to meet with experts and advisers. This is a time to spend more time in the Gulf and -- I never thought I'd say this to a [INTERVIEWED] but kick some butt. [Chuckles.] And I do not mean it to be funny. No. And I understand. And here is what I am going to push back hard on this, because I think that this is just an idea that got in folks' heads and the media has run with it. I was down there [DATE], before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf. [DATE] I was meeting with fishermen down there standing in the rain talking about what a potential crisis this could be. And I do not sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar. We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I know whose ass to kick, right? So, you know, this is not theater. Most of the decisions that I make on a day-to-[DATE] basis, I make because I have gathered the best information possible in very difficult situations, and my job is to figure out how can I move the federal government, the private sector, all the various players who are involved, to perform some very, very difficult tasks? And I do not always have time to perform for the benefit of the cable shows. What I do have is dedication and commitment to make sure that the people who are actually being affected by this are going to get the best possible service from me. And as long as I am [INTERVIEWED], that is the approach that I am going to take to this job. So this [ORG] challenge; you had [CARDINAL] schools competing -- Yeah. to have you give the commencement address. Why'd you pick [ORG]? This school is a great example of what is possible when you have got a public school, it is not in a wealthy community, it is diverse, and yet, because the community decided to invest by guaranteeing college tuition for any graduate here, you have got teachers and a principal who are dedicated and are willing to think out of the box, so they are not just bound by It is not in my contract, but they are doing all kinds of extra stuff. You are not going to find a more friendly audience than you are going to have when you give this speech [TIME]. I watched their enthusiasm when they met you [TIME]. Right. Your job is to inspire them Absolutely. and give them words of wisdom. What are you going to say to them? Well, I have to say, first of all, high-school audiences are the toughest, right, because Why? Well, you know, when you are a teenager, you think you know more than just about anybody. Not than [INTERVIEWED], though. Probably not. But my main message to these kids is, number one, internalize a sense of excellence. You know, I think most of these kids have had a lot of support, telling them, Do well. But as soon as you get out of here, nobody's telling you, and you have got to want that on your own. The second thing I am going to tell them is, No excuses. Take responsibility and go out there and set your goals and then work for them. And understand that stuff does not come easy. You have got to work. This is [PERSON] -- Oh, I know. -- alma mater. And one of the things I am going to remind them is that guy, you know, shagged a lot of grounders to end up being the captain of the [ORG]. And so that is a message. And then the third one is I also want kids to internalize the lesson of their community here, which is give back. A couple of other quick topics. Yeah. [PERSON], the dean of [GPE] correspondents -- sits in the front row at the press conferences all the time -- announced her retirement [DATE] after some inflammatory comments about [NORP] [NORP]. Your reaction to her retirement? Your reaction to her comments? Well, the comments were offensive. It is a shame, because [PERSON] was somebody who had been a correspondent through I do not know how manys; was a real institution in [GPE]. But I think she made the right decision. And is it something that taints her career, in your opinion? Well, you know, I think that those comments were out of line. And hopefully she recognizes that. On a much lighter note, you are a sports fan. Yeah. So you must have watched with the rest of us the near-perfect game pitched by [PERSON] of the [ORG]. -- [ORG] [TIME]. Did [PERSON] make the right call in not awarding a perfect game and reversing [PERSON], the umpire's call? He made the right call in not awarding the perfect game, but I think that baseball is going to have to take a look at what football and basketball already decided More replay. which is replay may, in some cases, be appropriate. I am not advocating for it. Are you a fan of that? I am saying that you may have to take a look at it. But here is what was wonderful was how a potentially sour story ended up being, for me, an inspiring story. I think the class with which the pitcher handled it, the way that [PERSON] owned up to making a mistake, the way the whole team went out there [DATE] and said, You know what, we all make mistakes, but you have had a great career as an umpire, I thought that showed something about sportsmanship that you do not see enough in [GPE] [DATE]. Yeah, for all the times I have had to explain bad sportsmanship to my kids, this was a teaching moment Yeah, that was a good example. which was nice.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday0", "text": "About Search And now to our exclusive conversation with [INTERVIEWED]. We sat down on [FAC] or at [FAC] on [DATE] to talk about the passage of his landmark health-care legislation and the nasty political tone in [GPE] [DATE]. But I began by asking [INTERVIEWED] about [DATE]'s surprise visit to [GPE] and why he felt it was important to go now and not earlier, when he was making his decision about a troop surge. Well, keep in mind that as I was making the decision about troop strength, [GPE] was still in the midst of an election or the post-election jockeying that was taking place, and it was very important to make sure that presidentof [GPE] does not look like he is parachuting in and changing the outcomes there. And I thought it was important now not only to send a strong message to the troops that we are fully behind what they are doing -- I think we have seen some progress, and I wanted to mark that progress that is been made -- but also it is an important time for President [PERSON]. He has made some important steps in the right direction, in improving governance, reducing corruption. But there is a long way to go. And as our troops are on the front line, as they are going into places like [GPE], potentially into [GPE], how the [NORP] government performs is going to be just as important as how the [NORP] national security forces perform. I am curious to hear you say there has been progress, because I was in [GPE] with Secretary [PERSON] back in [DATE], and he told me, when he met with President [PERSON], he talked about cracking down on corruption and cracking down on the drug trade, the very same topics you talked to President [PERSON] about. And I am curious. Do you think he is listening? Is he getting it? I think he is listening, but I think that the progress is too slow. And what we have been trying to emphasize is the fierce urgency of now, that on all of these issues, whether it is making sure that farmers are actually getting help on their irrigation, whether it is emphasizing the need to make sure that police and prosecutors and judges are operating fairly, in terms of making sure that in these provinces that the governors are actually looking out for the best interests of their people and what kind of appointments are being made -- on all those issues, we have got to make progress faster, and we cannot dilly-dally around. And so, look, obviously this is a country that has been stressed and in war, in one way or another, for [DATE] now. It is not going to transform itself [TIME]. But my hope is that President [PERSON] can recognize the incredible opportunity he has to be the father of a modern [GPE]. Let us talk about health-care reform; health-care law now we can talk about. It is seen as a huge victory for you, your presidency, for [NORP]. It is a tough pill to swallow for [NORP]. It is been described in a lot of different ways. Your vice president described it in colorful terms. [Laughs.] How do you describe it? I think it is a critical first step in making a health-care system that works for all [NORP]. It is not going to be the only thing. We are still going to have adjustments that have to be made to further reduce costs. Now what we have is a system in place that preserves the employer-based system but says, number [CARDINAL], insurance companies, they have to behave themselves. We are going to have a private system in insurance, but you cannot bar people from getting insurance because of pre-existing conditions. You cannot drop people when they get sick and need coverage most. So you cannot game the system. The second thing is we have set up what is going to be called an exchange, but it is basically just a marketplace where individuals who right now have to go out on their own and buy insurance and have no leverage are suddenly going to be part of a pool of [CARDINAL] of people, including, by the way, members of [ORG]. And that gives them more buying power, the same way [ORG] has more purchasing power when it buys from its suppliers. That will force insurance rates down for the vast majority of people. So what we now have is the basic principle that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should have to go without basic health care. My hope is that [DATE] we are going to see some very concrete benefits that people get. Small businesses are going to get [MONEY] in tax breaks to provide insurance to their employees. Parents are going to be able to put their children on their health insurance up to [DATE]. Insurers are not going to be able to just drop people from coverage because they feel like it. This version of health-care reform did not receive [CARDINAL] [NORP] vote. Mmm-hmm. You almost have to say that again Yeah. -- to let it really sink in: Not [CARDINAL] [NORP] vote. And a lot of people wonder how a bill, or now a law, could be good for the [NORP] public in general when it did not receive [CARDINAL] single [NORP] vote and when a recent poll said [PERCENT] of people are not in favor of this plan. How do you respond to that? Well, look, I think that [ORG] made a calculated decision, a political decision, that they would not support whatever we did. There was a quote by a well-known [NORP] senator who said, This is going to be [PERSON]'s Waterloo. This is going to we are going to bring him down just the same way that we brought down [PERSON], by making sure that health care fails. And I think that is unfortunate, because when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of [NORP] ideas. I mean, a lot of commentators have said, you know, this is sort of similar to the bill that [PERSON], the [NORP] governor and now presidential candidate, passed in [GPE]. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from [ORG]. And so So you think it is all politics. Well It is not about the inner workings of the bill. It is all politics. I will say that any objective observer looking at this bill would say that this is a middle-of-the-road, centrist approach to providing coverage to people and making sure that we are also reducing costs. I am frustrated that [NORP], who I think had an opportunity to help shape this bill, declined that opportunity. That is not to say that on specific provisions there might be legitimate concerns that they had, philosophical concerns that they had. Some of them, I think, sincerely believe that we should do more on this aspect of the bill or that aspect of the bill. But the overall architecture of it was actually something that was right down the middle. [PERSON], who is the deputy editorial-page editor of [ORG], had an interesting take on it, [INTERVIEWED]. He said, If you produce a bill that even [PERSON] of [GPE] cannot vote for, you have not produced legislation for the generations. You have produced once-in-a-lifetime legislation that no [NORP] from any constituency across [GPE] can vote for. What is your response to that? And my response is -- well, number [CARDINAL], the [ORG] editorial page generally is not favorable to [Inaudible.] Right. -- much of what I do. But I think what is interesting is that if you actually break down the specifics of the bill, you will see that this historically has had a lot of [NORP] support. There historically was a lot of [NORP] support for the notion of an individual mandate, that everybody should take responsibility. There was historic [NORP] support for the idea that we should make sure that entitlement reform exists within [ORG]. There was historically a lot of [NORP] support for the idea of the exchange, which is the centerpiece of the bill. So if you actually look at the particulars, these are all things that in the past others, including the [ORG] editorial page, have endorsed. And yet, oddly What you keep coming back to is that the fix was in is what you are basically saying. I think what happened is that they made a calculation, which, if you are thinking in terms of short-term politics, you can see the argument. Their attitude is, Look, if we stop this bill, if we paint it as stop this president here. -- and we stop this president here, then that will give us a lot of political benefit in [DATE]. What I have tried to say throughout is I will continually reach out to [NORP]. I will continue to incorporate their ideas even when they do not vote for the ideas that I have presented. But what I am not going to be dissuaded from is us going ahead and taking on these big challenges that are critical in terms of [GPE]'s long-term economic health. When we announced that we would be sitting down here with you at [FAC] [DATE], our in box filled quickly with e- mails from viewers all around the country. And [PERSON] in [GPE] asked a question I'd like your response to. He said, [INTERVIEWED], the [ORG] just issued a statement [DATE] that [ORG] had reached the tipping point [DATE] than they originally had estimated. With that said, how can we believe their figures on your health-care plan that says we will save [MONEY] over [DATE]? The reason that the tipping point was reached a little bit earlier is because the recession was so devastating. And presumably if growth picks up, then you will see that adjustment made again. Now, [ORG] generally has to be reformed to ensure long- term sustainability. But in [DATE] or any given period, it might end up being way off from estimates because of something like the financial crisis. Here is the interesting thing, though. [ORG] historically has actually underestimated the savings whenever [ORG] has been reformed, whenever we have made changes. And that was true the last time it was done. So we actually feel pretty optimistic that not only is [MONEY] going to be saved in [DATE], but more significantly, [MONEY] is going to be saved in [DATE]. Let us talk about where we are politically right now. And I do not have to tell you that this passage of this bill and turning it into law has left this country as politically divided as I think it has been in a long time. You might be able to cite some other examples. But the vitriol, the rhetoric, the sniping, the threats -- how are you possibly going to continue with any kind of legislative agenda when your opponents have said to you, I am not going to cooperate with this president, with these [NORP], unless it is a matter of national security ? How do you move on? Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the rhetoric has been overheated and overblown. And this is what happens in [GPE] when you have a big debate. Suddenly the passage of this bill is Armageddon. And as I pointed out, [DATE], after I signed it, I looked around and no asteroids had hit the planet -- -- and no cracks had appeared in the earth. This is a bill that is going to help a lot of people and help to lower costs of health care, but it is not a radical departure from what we have done in the past. Let us talk about faith a little bit, all right? There is been a lot of tension, and had been in [DATE], about your family's choice of a church here in [GPE]. As of yet, I have not heard that you have settled on an exact church. Where do you stand on that? And how important a decision is it for your family? Well, you know, what we have decided for now is not to join a single church. And the reason is because [PERSON] and I have realized we are very disruptive to services. Now, there are a whole bunch of churches who would say it is okay, but when every other member of the congregation has to be magged any time that you attend -- so what we have done is we occasionally go across the street to [ORG], which is a church that a lot of presidents traditionally have gone to. We love -- the chapel up in [FAC] is probably our favorite place to worship, because it is just families up at [FAC]. Right. There is a wonderful chaplain up there who does just a great job. And so usually when we go to [FAC], we go to church on [DATE] there. And in the meantime, what we have done -- there was a prayer circle of pastors from across the country who, during the campaign, would say a prayer for me or send a devotional. And we have kept that habit up. And it is a wonderful group, because it is a mix of some very conservative pastors, some very liberal pastors, but all who pray for me and [PERSON] and the girls. And I get a [DATE] devotional on my BlackBerry, which is a wonderful thing. It is spirituality meets high tech. Yeah, . That is pretty good. Your girls have been here in [FAC] for [DATE] now, along with [PERSON]. And when I spoke to Mrs. [PERSON] not long ago, I said, You know, the normalcy thing, how is that going? Here comes [DATE]. Yeah. A lot of kids -- Okay, I am going to [DATE] camp. Yeah. I am going to go to sleep-away camp, Dad. Have you gotten that question? I have. And how do you handle it? I have. And I handle it like every other dad, which is saying, Do not you want to spend it with me? Yeah. No, I want to go to sleep-away camp, Dad. So the -- you know, the happiest thing about [DATE] has been the girls' adjustment. They have just been terrific. They are doing well in school. They are not as constrained. They can wander around. Their [ORG] protection is a lot more low key. And so, you know, they have got soccer. They have got basketball. They go sleep over at their friends' houses. Right. They have got -- you know, sometimes I have got [CARDINAL] little girls screaming on the third floor of [FAC]. And they have made a great adjustment. And during [DATE] they are going to do what their friends are doing. If I was not in [FAC] -- So it is possible to have a normal summer as a first daughter. It is. It is. Now, I get a little worried about them when they are teenagers, because I think that is the time when you are already embarrassed about your parents. [Laughs.] And then imagine if your dad's -- He is president of [GPE]. -- in the newspaper [DATE] and people are calling him an idiot. You know, so I feel a little worried about that. On the other hand, [PERSON] and [PERSON] have just turned out to be unbelievably well-adjusted kids. And the thing that is most important to me is that they are so respectful of everybody and have not gotten on any airs. And I attribute that directly to [PERSON], because she would not put up with any of that stuff. All right, [CARDINAL] names, okay? [PERSON], [ORG], [GPE], [ORG]. How is your bracket look, first of all? It is completely blown up. [Laughs.] It is a sign that I was paying singular focus on health care. That is your excuse, and you are sticking with it? Well, you know, I had done great in the first several rounds. I was in first place. I think [ORG] calculated I was in the top 98th percentile. Yeah. And then every single -- Then the bottom fell out. Every single number [CARDINAL] seed except [ORG] -- and [ORG]'s the [CARDINAL] number [CARDINAL] seed I did not pick -- To get to the Final Four. -- at least to get to the final [CARDINAL]. But if you think about what we have left, you have got [CARDINAL] schools that represent states you carried in the election. Absolutely. You have got [CARDINAL] school that represents a state you did not carry. Right. So who are you picking? Well, I am not going to pick now. Oh, you have to pick now. No, you just -- When I was here for the Super Bowl, you picked then. You just explained to me why it was such bad politics. But I will say this. Just to show that I am not biased, I actually think that [GPE]'s got a great chance. And I did not win that state, but they have got a really good team. So [GPE] over [ORG] -- I think the winner of [ORG] will end up winning the championship. You do not see a number [CARDINAL] seed -- I do not . -- winning the championship. Good luck with that. Thank you. We sat here [DATE], Super Bowl Sunday. Right. And at that time, we were talking about hope and change. Right. And you were going to change the dialogue and the tone in this country. And you said, [PERSON], it takes time. It does. We have to build trust with the [NORP] before the tone can change. Things now are worse. If you look at historically what happens is that a party that is out of power, oftentimes in [DATE] out of power end up reacting very negatively. Their base ends up being very agitated. And it may take the next election or the next presidential election before things settle down. I think what is important is that we recognize, A, we can disagree without being disagreeable; B, that all of us, [NORP] and [NORP], have a responsibility as leaders to set the tone -- to not exaggerate what the other side is trying to do, to not suggest that they are bad people, to assume that they want what is best for [GPE], even if we disagree on the particular approach. And so my hope is that the [NORP] leadership will take that tone. Certainly that is the tone that I want to take. And I think that when you look at the issues that are still out there -- we still have to have an energy policy in this country that reduces our dependence on foreign oil; we have still got a broken immigration system; we still have financial regulatory reform, a major issue that I have been talking about now for [DATE], where we have got to figure out how to prevent the same kind of situation where a few reckless banks can bring down an entire economy. And on each of these issues, I am going to actively seek [NORP] support. But there are going to be areas where we disagree, and I will continue to maintain a tone where, if they have got good ideas, I am going to take them. Right. But if we disagree, then we will fight it out -- We are talking a lot about -- -- on the floor of the [ORG] or the [ORG]. We are talking a lot about [NORP] disagreement. In your opinion, do [NORP] deserve any of the blame for the tone in [GPE] right now? Well, there is no doubt that [NORP] are known to play the same game, which is to exaggerate the venality -- -- of the other side. There are times where [NORP] do things I do not like, but, you know, my working assumption is that they are doing what they think is best for the country. And I think there have been times where [NORP] do not confer that same benefit of the doubt onto the [NORP], and I think that is a tone that all of us should take. When I look at the division right now, I was thinking of President [PERSON] in preparing for this interview. And I remember, he came to office saying, I want to be the uniter. And by the end of his second term, people were calling him the opposite. They were saying, You are a divider. And I am sure President [PERSON] would argue that the country was divided because he had to tackle some very difficult issues and make tough choices. Having been through what you have just been through with health- care reform, do you now have a different opinion of the job that [PERSON] did in this office? You know, I think that, having sat in [FAC] as president, I am much more sympathetic to all presidents generally, because what is true is that there are big, tough decisions that you make, and you know that unless you try to avoid those problems, whatever you decide is going to make some people happy and some people unhappy. And I think there are some things that [PERSON] has done that were smart and the right thing to do. I have said that before. I do think that we now have a pattern of polarization, not just with [PERSON], but also previous to [PERSON] with [PERSON], where the political culture gets so wound up. Frankly, [PERSON], it gets spun up partly because of the way the media covers politics [DATE], in the 24/7 news cycle and the cable chatter and the talk radio and the Internet and the blogs, all of which tend to try to feed the most extreme sides of any issue instead of trying to narrow differences and solve problems. Is it solvable? Well, I do think it is solvable, because I think that when I go around the country and I talk to folks, they do not think in ideological terms. They do not think in terms of Republican- [NORP]. They think in terms of Is this good for my family? Will this help my kid go to college? Is this going to help me keep a good job that pays the rent or pays my mortgage? And if we can demonstrate, as an administration, that, regardless of whatever the day-to-[DATE] news cycle is saying, that we are staying focused on the big picture and helping families, and the results are good, then I think that will show that it is possible to be principled and stick to your convictions and not worry about the polls, and ultimately be rewarded politically. And, you know, nothing succeeds like success in this town. If other politicians watch and it turns out that taking a common-sense approach to problems works, suddenly, lo and behold, you might see more of that. Let me ask you about the tea party. This is a movement, this is an organization, that did not exist before you were president. And now they are in the headlines [DATE]. Some say they are a legitimate movement. Others think they are a fringe group. Where do you fall? You know, I think that it is a still loose amalgam of forces. There is a part of the tea-party movement that actually did exist before I was elected. We saw some of it leading up to my election. There are some folks who just were not sure whether I was born in [GPE] -- -- whether I was a socialist, right? So there is that segment of it, which I think is just dug in ideologically. And that strain has existed in [NORP] politics for a long time. Then I think that there is a broader circle around that core group of people who are legitimately concerned about the deficit, who are legitimately concerned that the federal government may be taking on too much. And [DATE] a bunch of the emergency measures we had to take in terms of dealing with the bank crisis, bailing out the auto industry, fed that sense that things are out of control. And I think those are folks who have legitimate concerns. And so I would not paint in broad brush and say that, you know, everybody who is involved or have gone to a tea-party rally or a meeting are somehow on the fringe. Some of them, I think, have some mainstream legitimate concerns. And, you know, my hope is that as we move forward and we are tackling things like the deficit and imposing a freeze on domestic spending and taking steps that show we are sincere about dealing with our long-term problems, that some of that group will dissipate. There is still going to be a group at their core that question my legitimacy or question [ORG] generally or question people who they consider to be against them in some way. And that group we are probably not going to convince.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday1", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. We are here in [FAC] at [FAC] with the 44th [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], it is great to be with you. How you doing? [INTERVIEWED]. I am doing great, [PERSON], thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. So you have been [INTERVIEWED] [DATE]. So let me ask the question that is on everyone's mind right now: How is it going living with your mother-in-law? [INTERVIEWED]. Fortunately, I love my mother-in-law and [INTERVIEWER1]. I am just asking. I am not trying to start trouble. [INTERVIEWED]. She is actually--she defends me whenever I screw up. So, [PERSON], you know, she is about to come down hard, my mother-in-law comes in, intercedes so [INTERVIEWER1]. Everything's copacetic. [INTERVIEWED]. The longer she stays, the better off I am going to be. [INTERVIEWER1]. I was driving over here, [INTERVIEWED]; I was thinking about this enormous transition that you have been through taking on the reins as Commander in Chief, Mrs. [PERSON] becoming the First Lady. But you have got a daughter, [DATE], and a daughter, [DATE], and this is a huge game-changer for them as well. How are they doing? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, they--I said this, I think, in an earlier interview--people think I am cool; nobody is cooler than my [CARDINAL] girls. They just seem to take whatever comes with, you know, happiness and steadiness. And they are loving school, they are making friends--in fact, they have got some friends from school over [DATE]--and they have already joined some clubs. And [PERSON], you know, I think maybe to endear myself to her, she decided she wanted to join a basketball team, so what more could I want? [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you getting to take part in some of the routines? I was thinking, you have been on the road basically for [DATE], although you got home a lot. Now, you are all under the same room, basically, for [DATE]. Are you there for breakfast? Do you get to read them a story at [TIME], tuck them in bed? How is it going? [INTERVIEWED]. It is the best deal of this whole thing, is it turns out I have got this nice home office. And at the end of the day, I can come home--even if I have got more work to do--I can have dinner with them; I can help them with their homework; I can tuck them in. If I have got to go back to the office, I can. But I am seeing them now more than any time in [DATE], and that is been great for the whole family. [INTERVIEWER1]. President [PERSON] said in his last press conference here at [FAC], he said he was not sure when it would happen for you, but there would be a moment, perhaps in [FAC], when you would stop and realize, I am [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. I am curious, have you had that moment? [INTERVIEWED]. There have been a couple of times, some wonderful, some sobering. Whenever you take that walk down the [PERSON] and you go to [FAC], I do think you get this sense of the history that you are now a part of. Some sobering moments: having to sign letters for troops who have died and sending letters to their families, where you realize every decision you make counts, and you do not have time to spend a lot of time on inconsequential stuff. You have got to focus on, at this point, putting people back to work, but also reminding yourselves that you have got [CARDINAL] of people around the world who are putting themselves in harm's way, and you are the Commander in Chief. [INTERVIEWER1]. You talk about sobering moments. Even as a Senator and member of [ORG] you were getting intelligence briefings, on the campaign trail also, and during the transition. But now, from what I understand, [DATE] you go down there and there is that intelligence briefing on your desk, and it is got to contain some pretty sobering stuff. There are [CARDINAL] of people watching this broadcast right now, [INTERVIEWED]. If they were to have access to the same information you have now on a [DATE] basis, how much less sleep would we all be getting? [INTERVIEWED]. Here is what I think is important for everybody to understand: We have got real threats, and we have to remain vigilant, but the quality of our [ORG] has never been better. When you meet the people who are charged with keeping [GPE] safe, it gives you enormous confidence. They are on the case day in, day out, with extraordinary professionalism. But there is no doubt that we have to make sure that we do not let up, because there are people who would be willing to do us harm. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let us talk about some of those men and women who are serving this country overseas in [GPE], other locations, in [GPE]. And I am sure they are watching [DATE]; it is a big event for [ORG]. And a lot of those people have a vested interest in [CARDINAL] of your campaign promises to end this war and get them home as soon--within [DATE]--as humanly possible. So when you look at them, can you say that a substantial number of them will be home in time for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I mean, we are going to roll out in a very formal fashion what our intentions are in [GPE], as well as [GPE]. But in conversations that I have had with the Joint Chiefs, with people--the commanders on the ground, I think that we have a sense, now that the [NORP] just had a very significant election, with no significant violence there, that we are in a position to start putting more responsibility on the [NORP], and that is good news for not only the troops in the field, but their families who are carrying an enormous burden. [INTERVIEWER1]. The economy, I mean, people are going to watch this game [DATE]; they are going to blow off some steam; they are going to have a good time. But a lot of them are going to go to bed, they are going to wake up [DATE] [TIME], and the worry is going to start again. They are going to worry about losing their jobs and their homes and putting their kids through school and making ends meet. How much worse is the economy going to get, [INTERVIEWED], before it gets better? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we are going to be in for a tough several months. We have got to get this economic recovery plan passed. We have got to start putting people back to work. We are going to have to straighten out the credit markets and make sure that credit is flowing to businesses and individuals so that they can start investing and hiring people again. And, you know, as soon as [ORG] moves forward on the recovery plan, we are going to be also releasing our plan for the financial sector and regulating the financial sector. I have confidence we are going to be able to get the economy back on track, but it is going to take [DATE] before we stop falling, and then a little bit longer for us to get back on track. [INTERVIEWER1]. And when it comes to the stimulus plan, the [ORG] passed its version [DATE], but without [CARDINAL] [NORP] vote. That disappointed a lot of people. The [ORG] takes up their version of the measure starting [DATE]. How important is gaining some more [NORP] support for that? How big a test of your leadership at this early stage of your Presidency? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, the important thing is getting the thing passed. And I have done extraordinary outreach, I think, to [NORP], because they have some good ideas, and I want to make sure that those ideas are incorporated. I am confident that by the time we actually have the final package on the floor that we are going to see substantial support. And people are going to say: this is a serious effort; it has no earmarks. We are going to be trimming out things that are not relevant to putting people back to work right now. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can you predict a number of [NORP] votes [INTERVIEWED]. No, of course not. [INTERVIEWER1]. You would not do that? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I would not . But I am confident that--look, I think that the [ORG] [NORP] actually adopted a number of ideas that the [ORG] [NORP] had offered. Obviously, the [ORG] [NORP] wanted to make a statement. Now it moves to the [ORG]. We have got [CARDINAL] people who feel it is their responsibility to represent their constituents and make their voices heard. So this is--democracy is always a somewhat messy process. But the thing I want all of them to remember, and the thing I am thinking about [DATE], is the [CARDINAL] of people who are being laid off of their jobs right now. They cannot afford politics as usual, and old habits are hard to break, but now is the time to break them because we have got an urgent situation. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let us lighten up a little bit. Let us move towards sports, okay? You came out and you said, Look, in college football I am not crazy about the current system for determining a national champion. [INTERVIEWED]. This is true. [INTERVIEWER1]. I'd rather see a playoff system like in professional baseball or professional football. So will you look into the camera right now and talk to the people of [GPE] and their [CARDINAL] electoral votes, and tell them that the [ORG] are not the national champions of football? [INTERVIEWED]. Where is the camera, right here? [INTERVIEWER1]. There you go. [INTERVIEWED]. Congratulations, [NORP], on an outstanding season. [PERSON] is great. Would not you feel better if you had beat every team that was out there through a playoff system? [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] electoral votes. [INTERVIEWED]. I love you. I think they could have taken on anybody through the playoff system. By the way, [CARDINAL] of our [ORG] guys, his son is a tackle on [ORG], so, you know, I have got soft spot for the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER1]. You have got a connection. [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let us talk about this game [DATE]. You came out--and most Presidents do not pick a team--you came right out and you said, Look, I know the [PERSON]. They have been good friends of mine; they endorsed me. I think you got the [ORG] championship ball [INTERVIEWED]. I did. [INTERVIEWER1]. So you said, Other than my dear [ORG], they are closest to my heart. But I am having a hard time understanding how you, of all people, would not associate with the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. Underdog [INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, it is a Cinderella story. The team that came from nowhere to the big game, the audacity of hope. [INTERVIEWED]. Not to mention the fact that [PERSON] is close to my age. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right, exactly. How can you turn your back on the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. I love [PERSON] story. I love--[PERSON] seems like just a wonderful young man. It is a great story. But [PERSON] did not just endorse me; that guy was out going to steel plants campaigning for me. [PERSON] was out waving towels at my rallies. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have a Terrible Towel in the other room? [INTERVIEWED]. I do, actually, so [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to be waving them at the party? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not going to be rubbing it in. We have got some [GPE] Congressmen here, and I may need their vote on the recovery package. [INTERVIEWER1]. Give me a score. What is the score going to be in this game? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, it is tough to predict, but I think the [ORG] are going to eke it out in a close one. [INTERVIEWER1]. All right. Well, [DATE], you predicted the [ORG] over my [ORG]. I do not have a question here; I just wanted to rub that in a little bit. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am still wondering how the guy made that catch. [INTERVIEWER1]. The Hail Mary? [INTERVIEWED]. He has some Stickum on his helmet. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. He had Stickum on his helmet. [INTERVIEWER1]. They just dissected that play in [TIME] segment on the show. [INTERVIEWED]. It was one of the greatest plays in pro football history. [INTERVIEWED]'s BlackBerry [INTERVIEWER1]. Let us talk about the BlackBerry, all right? You got to keep it. [INTERVIEWED]. I did. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I see it? Do you have it? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, I did not bring it down here. [INTERVIEWER1]. No? [INTERVIEWED]. No, it is like [PERSON]; you know, the--if you touched it, it might blow up. [INTERVIEWER1]. I kind of envision that it is like Q in the James Bond. Did they give you, like, fingerprint recognition technology or something? [INTERVIEWED]. The works. The works. It turns into a car if I have to make a quick getaway. [INTERVIEWER1]. How many people have that e-mail address? [INTERVIEWED]. A handful. Look, there are security issues involved, and so we have got to make sure that I am not creating a situation where, you know, potentially people can comprise our system somehow. [INTERVIEWER1]. But, like, world leaders, can they contact you on that BlackBerry? [INTERVIEWED]. Typically, world leaders are going to be contacting me through [FAC]. They know how to reach me there. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] and [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] and [PERSON] can always contact me. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well [INTERVIEWER1]. Maybe. You are not going to hook me up, are you? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], do you want one? [INTERVIEWER1]. No, I want your e-mail address. I want to communicate with you during the game. [INTERVIEWED]. I like your son; I might give it to him. I am not going to give it to you. [PERSON], he might get one. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON], give it to your papa, okay? [INTERVIEWER1]. Let me end on some--not only did you just become [INTERVIEWED], obviously, that carries a certain amount of fame with it. But you have achieved a certain rock star status outside of that. [INTERVIEWED]. Outside of my house. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, let me show you. This is the current issue of [ORG], and here is a great picture of [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, it is a beautiful [INTERVIEWER1]. you and [PERSON] and your daughters. The reason I bring this up--I think it is funny--it is a great picture. But I want to show you the cover. Look what they did: they took you off the cover; they cut you out of it. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it is a little hurtful. [INTERVIEWER1]. You got replaced by [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, who is in a weight battle, apparently. Yes, oh, well. [INTERVIEWED]'s Message to the American People [INTERVIEWER1]. What would you like to say to [CARDINAL] of people who are watching this game [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, listen, have a wonderful time. The Super Bowl is one of the finest [NORP] traditions. I want to give a special shout-out to our troops overseas who are going to be watching this, because you allow not just this game to take place, but our liberties to be preserved, and we are very grateful to you. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], it is a pleasure. Thanks for welcoming us to [FAC]. Enjoy the game. [INTERVIEWED]. Have a great time. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you. We certainly will. [INTERVIEWED]. I will see if I have to eat my words again [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. We will see; we will call you [DATE], okay? I will e-mail you. [INTERVIEWER1]. You talked a lot during the campaign and in your Inaugural Address about bipartisanship, getting people to work together, about unity. And then people watched this vote on the stimulus package in the [ORG], and they saw that not [CARDINAL] [NORP] voted for it. What would you say to the people who were watching that speech of yours at home and maybe the [CARDINAL] people who were freezing out there on the [FAC], who were saying, You know what, we thought we could change, and maybe we were naive ? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, listen, it is only been [DATE]. People have to recognize that it is going to take some time for trust to be built not only between [NORP] and [NORP], but between [ORG] and [ORG], between the [ORG] and the [ORG]. You know, we have had a dysfunctional political system for a while now. And the fact that we have been able to move what is by all accounts a historic piece of legislation through this quickly, and that the [ORG] is having a serious debate about it, and we still expect it to be on my desk for signature [DATE], is quite an achievement. But it is going to take time for people to start getting used to the fact that we do not have to score political points on every issue. Once in a while, we can take the politics out of it and just focus on getting the job done for the [NORP] people. [INTERVIEWER1]. You were pretty agitated [DATE] when the news broke of these Wall Street bonuses paid out in [DATE], even as some of the firms that paid them out had their hands out looking for Federal assistance. And is there some--is there an audit underway right now, or can there be an audit that takes place to make sure that none of the taxpayers' monies goes to anything but stabilizing these firms? [INTERVIEWED]. That is what I have asked my [ORG] Secretary to do: to put together a clear set of guidelines. If a bank or a financial institution is getting relief, then they have got to abide by certain conditions. Now, as I said when I blew off a little steam in [FAC], the [NORP] people do not resent folks for getting rich. That is part of the [NORP] way. But they do expect that you share in the pain, and they do expect that if taxpayers are having to pony up the bill, then these folks are going to show some restraint. Obviously, they are not doing it on their own. We are going to have to make sure that it is part of the package that we put forward in terms of how we spend money in the future. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, we have seen some crazy examples; I mean, when the auto executives arrived in [GPE] for those hearings in [ORG] in those private jets, these bonuses. The [NORP] people might worry that the bailout, you know, could be off course, because if the money is going to people who simply are out of touch, it is not a confidence builder. [INTERVIEWED]. Right. Well, and that is why it is my job as [INTERVIEWED] and [ORG]'s job to make sure that there are some rules of the road that people are going to abide by, and that we have got transparency and accountability, that this stuff is being posted. And [CARDINAL] of the things that we are going to do is put together an independent board on the recovery package [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. that actually looks at these programs and the money before it goes out the door. Nothing is worse than finding out after the fact [INTERVIEWER1]. When it is too late [INTERVIEWED]. when it is too late that money has been wasted. We are going to make sure that on the front end, this stuff has been evaluated. [INTERVIEWER1]. It is hard to estimate because there are so many different numbers going around there, [INTERVIEWED], but it seems like somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 to $350 billion in [ORG] money has already gone out and been spent. And you are hearing more and more people saying, it is going to take much, much more. I am curious, though, have you heard anyone credible be able to put a real figure on how much it is going to take to fix this, and, B, who can say, And this money will work; it will fix the economy ? [INTERVIEWED]. Here is what I have heard from a range of economists across the political spectrum. The banks, because of mismanagement, because of huge risk-taking, are now in very vulnerable positions. We can expect that we are going to have to do more to shore up the financial system. We also are going to have to make sure that we set up financial regulations so that not only does this never happen again, but you start having some sort of trust in how the credit markets work again. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. So all that is going to have to happen on parallel tracks. How much it is going to end up costing taxpayers is going to depend in part on how well we manage the process, how well we are overseeing the spending. And that is why I have said before we put out more money, what we want to do is set up very clear guidelines. That is the charge of my [ORG] Secretary, [PERSON]; that is the charge that [PERSON], my national economic adviser, has. And I do have confidence that we are going to be able to get it right, but it is not going to be [TIME], and there is no silver bullets to this. The fact of the matter is, is that we are suffering from a massive hangover from a binge of risk-taking. [INTERVIEWER1]. And it is still getting worse. [INTERVIEWED]. And that is still getting worse. And it is going to take some time for us to be able to dig ourselves out of this hole. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] of those parallel tracks you talked about--are you planning in the near future to announce an idea that will buy up the toxic debt from the balance sheets of these banks with perhaps a so-called bad bank, similar to what happened with the savings and loan crisis? And if so, what do you think that could cost? Because [PERSON] came out and said, since we do not really know what those debts are worth, this could cost [MONEY]. [INTERVIEWED]. No, it is a--we are not going to be spending [MONEY] worth of taxpayer money. It is conceivable that we have more--not only is it conceivable, it is likely that the banks have not fully acknowledged all the losses that they are going to experience. They are going to have to write down those losses, and some banks will not make it. Other banks are going to make sure that we strengthen. All deposits are going to be safe for ordinary people, but we are going to have to wring out some of these bad assets and [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to set up a bad bank or whatever it would be called? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I do not want to preempt an announcement [DATE]. And there is a lot of technical aspects to it, and if I say that we are doing [CARDINAL] thing, then the markets might interpret it differently from what it ends up being. But the basic principle: that we are going to have to see some of this debt written down; that the Government is going to have to support some banks; that others that are not viable--essentially, that we are going to have to do something with those assets. You know, that is all going to be part of a overall plan that not only strengthens the credit markets, but more importantly, puts people back to work, because that is what people are experiencing right now. They are seeing their jobs lost [DATE]. Their neighbors, friends, or, you know, coworkers are losing their jobs. And what they want to know is, is that [ORG] and [ORG] has a single-minded focus on making sure that people can be put back to work. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let me ask you about a exit strategy, and I am not talking about in [GPE] here, although there is been a lot of talk about that. But do you have an exit strategy for this bailout? In other words, at some point will you say, Wait [TIME], we have spent this amount of money; we are not seeing the results; we have got to change course dramatically. Is there that kind of strategy in place? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, if we are doing things properly then what you will start seeing is slowly trust get rebuilt, banks' balance sheets will start to strengthen; they will start lending to each other; they will start lending to companies; they will start lending to small businesses. There will be some institutions that continue to be weak, and we are going to have to do something with them. Over time, as the market confidence is restored, then what we can do is start getting rid of some of these assets, some of the stock the taxpayers now have in some of these companies start being worth more. We sell them off to private parties, and taxpayers can recoup that money. So you know, it is going to have to happen in stages. The key thing, I think, for the public right now is they have to know that I am going to be spending all my time making sure that their money is not wasted, because I am going to be, ultimately, accountable. Look, I am at the start of my administration. [CARDINAL] nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I have got [DATE] and [INTERVIEWER1]. You are going to know quickly how people feel about what is happened. [INTERVIEWED]. That is exactly right. And, you know, [DATE], I think people are going to see that we are starting to make some progress, but there is still going to be some pain out there. If I do not have this done in [DATE], then there is going to be a [CARDINAL]-term proposition. And I welcome that responsibility, because I think now's the time for us to start shifting and thinking about long-term economic growth. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let me go on quickly if I can to some other subjects. You signed an Executive order in [DATE] that says you will close the military detention center at [FAC] within [DATE]. So the clock is ticking. And already you have heard the criticism that you do not know what you are going to do with the [CARDINAL] prisoners being held there. [PERSON], the top [NORP] on [ORG], said the decision to close [FAC] by [DATE] places hope ahead of reality. It sets an objective without a plan to get there. [INTERVIEWED]. Let me say this. We had a long campaign between myself and [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] thing we did not disagree on--in fact, something that [PERSON] was as adamant as I was, was that we needed to close [FAC]. It is the right thing to do. Ultimately, it will make us safer. You have already seen in the reaction around the world a different sense of [GPE] by us taking this action. Now, is it going to be easy? No, because we have got [CARDINAL] of hardcore militants that, unfortunately, because of some problems that we had previously in gathering evidence, we may not be able to try in ordinary courts, but we do not want to release. How we structure that is something that I am going to do carefully. Our lawyers are reviewing it. I have absolute confidence that, ultimately, we are going to be able to find a mechanism, with the cooperation of the international community, with the cooperation of some very smart [NORP], like [PERSON], a former JAG who knows this stuff well. I have confidence that we are going to be able to find a solution to this problem. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all worried--and some of these people may be released, the ones that seem to be less of a threat. But if [CARDINAL] of those people that is released goes back and takes part in the planning of or carrying out of an attack against [GPE] interests, you are going to have a [PERSON] times [CARDINAL] situation on your hands. How are you going to deal with that? [INTERVIEWED]. Of course I am worried about it. Look, the--I have to make the very best judgments I can make in terms of what is going to keep the [NORP] people safe, and is what--what is going to uphold our Constitution and our traditions of due process. And what I am convinced of is that we can balance those interests in a way that makes all of us proud, but also assures that we are not attacked. Now, can I guarantee--or can anybody guarantee, for that matter--that some of the people who have already been released--keep in mind, I mean, [ORG] released a whole bunch of folks out of [FAC], some of them have rejoined some of these militant organizations--can we guarantee that they are not going to try to participate in another attack? No. But what I can guarantee is that if we do not uphold our Constitution and our values, that over time that will make us less safe and that will be a recruitment tool for organizations like [ORG]. That is what I have got to keep my eye on. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let me ask you about [GPE]. [ORG] Secretary [PERSON] said this is going to be a long slog, and that it is our greatest military challenge. You are going to send [CARDINAL] additional [GPE] troops in there. Can that make a difference in a country that is had [DATE] of trouble and that is been called the graveyard of empires ? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I have not definitively authorized the [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] troops, although planning has been done. And I think that it is very important that we have enough troops on the ground that we are not putting those who are already there at risk, and that we can accomplish some core missions. We are not going to be able to rebuild [GPE] into a [NORP] democracy. [INTERVIEWER1]. So what is the mission there now? [INTERVIEWED]. What we can do is make sure that [GPE] is not a safe haven for [ORG]. What we can do is make sure that it is not destabilizing neighboring [GPE], which has nuclear weapons. And that is going to require not only military efforts, but also diplomatic efforts. It is also going to require development efforts in a coordinated fashion. And that is why I have asked the Joint Chiefs that have produced a review. [PERSON] is reviewing the situation there. We assigned [PERSON] as a special envoy to the region. They are all working together. They will be presenting to me a plan. But the key is the point you made. We have got to have a clear objective. And there is been drift in [GPE] over [DATE]. That is something that we intend to fix [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] last questions. [CARDINAL] is about security, not national security, but your own. There was an article in [ORG] that some of the big donors who were invited to some of your [DATE] functions were--I think the word they used was shocked by how easy it was to get access to you. And they expressed concerns that not enough was being done to secure you. First of all, just your opinion on that. [INTERVIEWED]. I have complete confidence in [ORG]. These guys and gals are unbelievably professional, they know what they are doing, and I basically do what they tell me to do. Now, sometimes I am the first one to admit that it chafes a little bit being inside this bubble. It is the hardest adjustment of being [INTERVIEWED], not being able to just take a walk or [INTERVIEWER1]. I watched you walk down the halls a couple of times, and there is someone in front of you and someone behind you. [INTERVIEWED]. That is exactly right. So it is tough. But I have complete confidence in their ability to keep me safe. Peanut Butter Products Recall/[ORG] [INTERVIEWER1]. Last question. There is been a massive peanut butter products recall in this country over [DATE]. Most of the products track--trace to [CARDINAL] plant down in [GPE] that has a bit of a history of sending out products even though there have been traces of Salmonella found. The question--the obvious question people want to know, is the [ORG] doing its job? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that the [ORG] has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch. And so we are going to be doing a complete review of [ORG] operations. I do not want to prejudge this particular case, but there have been enough instances over [DATE], and at bare minimum we should be able to count on our Government keeping our kids safe when they eat peanut butter. That is what [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. It seems a simple thing. [INTERVIEWED]. That is what [PERSON] eats for lunch, probably [CARDINAL] times a week. And I do not want to have to worry about whether she is going to get sick as a consequence of having her lunch. So we are going to make sure that we retool the [ORG], that it is operating in a highly professional fashion, and most importantly, that we prevent these things, as opposed to trying to catch them after they have already occurred. [INTERVIEWER1]. I really appreciate your time. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you. [There was a break in the interview, and then it resumed as follows.] The First Family's Transition to Life in [ORG] [INTERVIEWER1]. Has there been any surprise in terms of life in [FAC]? Is there something that [ORG] has you did not think they had or does not have you thought they did have? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, the bowling alley does not seem to be improving my game. That is the [CARDINAL] thing I have noticed. [INTERVIEWER1]. Have you used it? [INTERVIEWED]. We did. We took the kids down, and I wanted to use the bumpers, but [PERSON] said that is only [INTERVIEWER1]. If it does not work, you had the gutters at least? That is good. It is good to know you are not cheating in bowling, good. You are playing horse on the basketball court. [INTERVIEWED]. That is right, playing horse on the basketball court. There is a horseshoe pitch out there, so I am going to have to practice that a little bit. [INTERVIEWER1]. After [DATE]--it is a minuscule amount of time--are you and Mrs. [PERSON] more or less confident that you can keep a real sense of normalcy in the girls' lives? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, I think that we are going to be okay. Look, [PERSON] is [DATE], so [DATE], she is [DATE]. Who knows what happens to teenagers. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. But if there are a pair of kids who can handle this weird fishbowl, it is those [CARDINAL]. They are just even keeled; they are happy, cheerful--the prettiest, respectful kids. [INTERVIEWER1]. You are starting off from the right place. [INTERVIEWED]. That is exactly right. And having--this is where having the mother-in-law, you know, who will not take any guff from them, really helps. So we feel pretty good about it. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, we all wish you luck. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much. [INTERVIEWER1]. Go enjoy the game. [INTERVIEWED]. Good. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thanks for your time. I really appreciate it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstodayshowcovingtonlouisiana", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] of the volunteers [TIME] are [INTERVIEWED2] and [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWED2], good to see you again; [INTERVIEWED1], nice to have you here. [INTERVIEWED]. Hi, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] trips to this region for you since [DATE], I believe, for you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Give me a sense of the biggest change you have seen over [DATE] in this area. [INTERVIEWED2]. I think we have seen the spirits change. I mean, the storm hit; it was an overwhelming moment for a lot of people. And then they are beginning to realize, people the local people are beginning to realize there is hope; there is a chance to rebuild lives. And a lot of people care about them. I have seen some infrastructure change. The debris is being cleared, and roads are being rebuilt. And it is a remarkable spirit here in this part of the world. I mean, people say, Look, we are going to rebuild our lives, and they have realized a lot of people from around the country want to help them. [INTERVIEWER1]. And as you see the progress, you also see how much remains to be done. [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. [INTERVIEWER1]. Schools still need to be reopened [INTERVIEWED]. That is true. [INTERVIEWER1]. health facilities and all that sort of thing. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am worried about the schools. I am really interested in that. But I am also proud that so many people have gone to school, so many parents have put their kids in school wherever they are, if they are in [GPE] or [GPE] or [GPE] or wherever, and I think that is really important. [INTERVIEWER1]. So much more visibility on your part, [INTERVIEWED2], following Hurricane Rita and, as I mentioned, the [CARDINAL] trips to this region, as compared to what was seen as a slow and inefficient [ORG] response after Hurricane Katrina. Is this one of those situations where you are trying to get a second chance to make a first impression? [INTERVIEWED2]. I do my job as best I can. [CARDINAL] of the things that we do is we respond to crises. And as I told the people, if I did not respond well enough, we are going to learn the lessons. If there is any mistakes made at the [ORG] level, I, of course, accept responsibility for them. On the other hand, there is a lot of good that is taken place, a lot of people are working hard. We had chopper drivers pulling people off roofs. We had, you know, people working [TIME] to save lives, and the story will unfold. I mean, the facts of the story will come out over time, and the important thing is for [ORG], [ORG], and local governments to adjust and to respond. [INTERVIEWER1]. I talked to a prominent [NORP] in [GPE] who has said that this type of appearance, while it is great to see you guys rolling up your sleeves and grabbing a hammer and helping with this piece of wall here, that it is a photo op, and they want to see a plan on paper, your plan to rebuild this region. Do you have that kind of a plan? [INTERVIEWED2]. Well, [PERSON], you see, I do not think [GPE] ought to dictate to [GPE] how to rebuild. I guess we have a different philosophy than whoever the prominent [NORP] was you spoke to. [TIME] [PERSON] and I had dinner with Mayor [PERSON] and a group of distinguished [GPE] citizens from all walks of life. And my message to them was, We will support the plan that you develop. The point is, is that it comes from the local folks. And I recognize there is an attitude in [GPE] that says, We know better than the local people. That is just not the attitude I have. [INTERVIEWER1]. There was recently a loan package approved by [ORG], [MONEY] in emergency loans for the [GPE] hardest hit by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That is the good news. Some [NORP] complain that there was wording taken out of that loan package, a forgiveness clause that has traditionally been included in loan packages in the past. And they are wondering why these [CARDINAL] States were singled out. Would you ask [ORG] to go back into that legislation and reinstate the forgiveness clause? [INTERVIEWED2]. I think [ORG] what [ORG] said was is that the previous loans were limited to a relatively small amount of money. These loans are much greater loans, and that what [ORG] has said is, You will have [DATE] to repay, plus [DATE] to repay. And so I think it is a kind of package that [ORG] was comfortable with giving, and I was happy to sign it. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON], who, as you know, is a [NORP] from [GPE], a Congresswoman, said [INTERVIEWED2]. You are quoting a lot of [NORP] [DATE], [PERSON]. That is interesting. [INTERVIEWER1]. She said that we are not asking the people of [GPE] to pay back the money we are spending there. Why are we asking the people of the gulf coast, requiring them to pay back this money? How would you respond to that? [INTERVIEWED2]. Well, the people of [GPE] are paying a heavy price for terrorism. A lot of people are dying, [PERSON]. These people are working hard to establish democracy, and they are paying a serious price. Look, I understand there are a lot of politics. [CARDINAL] of the things that I suggested was we keep the politics out of [GPE] and [GPE] as we all work together to rebuild these communities. And we have got people here who volunteered their time, from all over the country, and they did not say, you know, I am a [NORP], and I am going to work here, or, I am a [NORP], and I am going to come and work here. They said, I am an [NORP] that wants to contribute. And the reason why [PERSON] and I are here is because we want to encourage other [NORP] to help somebody find shelter or help somebody find food or to continue to express the incredible compassion that the country saw when displaced persons moved from this part of the world and are scattered around the country. [INTERVIEWER1]. Which is a good point. So in other words, if someone says to you, Okay, you are moving a wall [DATE], and it is a photo op, but if that inspires someone else in another community to move a wall and grab a hammer, then that is mission accomplished? [INTERVIEWED]. That is right. And also, this gives us a chance to thank the people who do this all the time, not just in a crisis situation but who volunteer with [ORG] in their towns wherever they are across the country or volunteer in a million other ways working in schools or other ways. And this is really, really important, and it is very [NORP] to step out and help. [INTERVIEWED2]. I understand there is a lot of politics, and you keep talking about this politician or that politician. I think our job is to elevate this whole process out of normal politics. Frankly, we are supposed to [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that possible, though? I mean, is not it inevitable it will be bogged down in politics? [INTERVIEWED2]. It depends on who asks the questions, I guess. I think most [NORP] are not interested in this kind of politics. I think most [NORP] are interested in contributing. And the amazing thing about Katrina and Rita is that there has been a fantastic response by people from all walks of life that have welcomed a neighbor and said, Brother, what can I do to help you? Or, How can I show you love? And I applaud the Today show and [ORG] and your partners in being a part of a larger picture of helping people rebuild their lives. It is a great contribution. [INTERVIEWER1]. While I have you here and while you do not have a hammer in your hand, can I ask you well, you have it in your belt about some things going on in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED2]. Sure. [INTERVIEWER1]. A lot of criticism coming for your nominee to [ORG], [PERSON], from conservatives, people like [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Were you taken off-guard a little bit, caught by surprise by the amount of criticism you are getting for Judge [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED2]. Well, you know, I made a decision to put somebody on the [ORG] who had not been a part of what they call the judicial monastery. In other words I listened, by the way, to people in the [ORG] who suggested, Why do not you get somebody from the outside. And I figured that people are going to kind of question whether or not it made sense to bring somebody from outside the court. I would remind those, [CARDINAL], that [PERSON] is an extraordinary, accomplished woman who has done a lot. As a matter of fact, she has consistently ranked as [CARDINAL] of the top [CARDINAL] women lawyers in [GPE], that she has broken the glass ceiling. She has served as a great example. She is a brilliant person. And that just because she has not served on the bench does not mean that she cannot be a great [ORG] Justice. [INTERVIEWER1]. But you know, conservatives are worried about what is going to happen when she gets on the bench, and they are worried about what is going to happen in the future. And I get the feeling and I am not sure if this is too strong I get the feeling some [NORP], [INTERVIEWED2], are feeling let down by you, and they are thinking they have supported you for so long and when an issue that is so important to them comes up, that you let them down. How would you answer that? [INTERVIEWED2]. My answer is [PERSON] is going to be confirmed, and people will get to see why I put her on the bench. She is an extraordinary woman. [INTERVIEWER1]. You said she is the most qualified candidate for the job [INTERVIEWED2]. As I told you. [INTERVIEWER1]. would you agree with that? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. Absolutely. [INTERVIEWER1]. You had pushed for a woman to be a nominee. [INTERVIEWED]. That is right. And I know [PERSON] well. I know how accomplished she is. I know how many times she is broken the glass ceiling, herself. She is a role model for young women around our country. [INTERVIEWER1]. Some are suggesting [INTERVIEWED]. Not only that, she is very deliberate and thoughtful and will bring dignity to wherever she goes, but certainly to [ORG] she will be really excellent. [INTERVIEWER1]. Some are suggesting there is a little possible sexism in the criticism of Judge [PERSON]. How do you feel about that? [INTERVIEWED]. That is possible. I think that is possible. I think she is so accomplished, and I know I think people are not looking at her accomplishments and not realizing that she was the first elected woman to be the head of [ORG], for instance, and all the other things. She was the first woman managing partner of a major law firm. She was the first woman hired by a major law firm, her law firm. [INTERVIEWED2]. My attitude, [PERSON], is when people get to know her, they will see why I picked her. [INTERVIEWED]. They will. In the confirmation hearings alone, they will see that she what she is like. [INTERVIEWER1]. I think [ORG] has a story [TIME] that said they had [CARDINAL] [NORP] Senators have serious questions about Judge [PERSON] or about [PERSON] [INTERVIEWED2]. No, Judge [PERSON] well spoken. [INTERVIEWER1]. I was going to say kind of getting ahead of myself here. So you are convinced that she will be confirmed? [INTERVIEWED2]. Absolutely. Not only am I convinced that she will be confirmed; I am convinced that she will be a fine, great judge. And I am convinced that she will be the kind of she will not change. I mean, the person I know is not the kind of person that is going to change her philosophy. And her philosophy is, is that she is not going to legislate from the bench. So I told the [NORP] people when I campaigned for President the type of judge I will pick. I picked that type of person in [PERSON], and I picked that type of person in [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Your political guru, [PERSON], is set to or scheduled to testify before a grand jury for the fourth time [DATE], it seems, looking into the leak of a [ORG] agent's name. You have said if someone on your staff had anything to do with that leak, you will take care of that person. Has [PERSON] looked you in the eye, [INTERVIEWED2], and said, I, in no way, bent or broke the rules or the law when it comes to this case ? [INTERVIEWED2]. [PERSON], I have also consistently said I am not going to talk about the case. It is under review, so I am not going to talk about it. Thank you for asking, but on the other hand, the special prosecutor has made it clear and made it clear that he does not want anybody speculating or talking about the case, so I am not going to talk about it. [INTERVIEWER1]. But does it worry you that they seem to have such an interest in Mr. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED2]. I am not going to talk about the case. I have been asked this a lot; my answer is consistent. The special prosecutor is conducting a very serious investigation. He is doing it in a very dignified way, by the way, and we will see what he says. [INTERVIEWER1]. Got a big date coming up in [GPE] [DATE], on [DATE], a vote on the referendum on the constitution there. What do you expecting to happen there? And what are you expecting to happen in [DATE] leading up to that vote? [INTERVIEWED2]. I expect violence, because there is a group of terrorists and killers who want to try to stop the advance of democracy in [GPE]. I also expect people to vote, which is a remarkable achievement. We had a remarkable achievement [DATE] when [CARDINAL] of people voted. They now have a chance to vote on a constitution that will help unify the country. And then they will have a chance to vote, if the constitution passes, on a permanent government. And so what you are seeing is the unfolding of a dual-track strategy. On the [CARDINAL] hand, democracy is advancing, much to the amazement of a lot of people, particularly people in the region. And on the other hand, we are working to train [NORP] troops so they can provide the security for a democracy to move forward. [INTERVIEWER1]. I am going to let you get back to work in [TIME]. I am just curious about [CARDINAL] other subject, and you have spoken about this recently, this whole issue of a possible worldwide pandemic, this avian flu. You know, [CARDINAL] people have died in Asia so far. They are worried that if this comes here, there are, by some estimates this could claim [CARDINAL] of lives around the world. After Hurricane Katrina, there are some people in this country who are worried. They are not sure who is in charge, who do I turn to, who is going to handle a major catastrophe in this country? Are you confident that this administration has a plan in place to handle something like that? [INTERVIEWED2]. I am confident that we are working to identify the possible outbreak of avian flu, contain it to where the outbreak takes place, and strategize how to deal with it if it ever were to come to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Who would take the lead in that? Would it be a military situation? Would it be homeland security? [INTERVIEWED2]. It is a really interesting question, and it is one that I raised that has created a little bit of consternation among some. I have said that there may be a catastrophic event such that [ORG] has got the it is only [ORG] that has got the capacity to move in quickly with a lot of resources, which would require law changes. For example, the military cannot become police without a special proclamation. And so we are planning all this out. We are in the midst of, [CARDINAL], identifying that there may be a problem, and, [CARDINAL], what to do about it. When I have a plan that I am comfortable with, of course I will talk to the [NORP] people about it. [INTERVIEWER1]. Your husband has been through an awful lot [INTERVIEWED]. Our country has been through an awful lot. [INTERVIEWER1]. What toll have you seen this take, personally, on him? Not only you know, we had 9/11 in the first term, and now we have got [GPE], and we have got Katrina, and we have got Rita. What toll have you seen this take? [INTERVIEWED]. Well [INTERVIEWED2]. He can barely stand. He is about to drop on the spot. [INTERVIEWED]. He is doing great. He is got big, broad shoulders. There is a lot, but there is a lot on the [NORP] people too, and their response has been so terrific. You know, we can face challenges, and they are tough, and this is very tough down here. The number of people, the huge number of people that are displaced, that have lost everything, but you know, people are rebuilding their lives, and other people want to help them, and that is what I see. [INTERVIEWED2]. You know, I am the kind of guy who gets inspired by the decency of others, and as I travel the country and see this incredible spirit, it is so uplifting. It makes me understand how blessed we are to be an [NORP]. These folks right here I never met them before, but they are from all over the country. They are here for one reason, to love a neighbor. And that is a remarkable expression. And [PERSON] and I want to thank them, and we want to encourage others around the country to do to follow their lead and follow their example. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, this is going to be the home of the [PERSON] family, and we are going to talk to the [PERSON] family in a little while. [INTERVIEWED]. That is great. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED1], [INTERVIEWED2], thanks so much for your time [TIME]. [INTERVIEWED2]. Thanks, [PERSON], appreciate it. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Grab your hammers, and go back to work.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstodayshownewyorkcity", "text": "About [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], good [TIME]; nice to have you here. [INTERVIEWED]. Good [TIME], [PERSON]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. I do not think I am betraying any confidence when I say that I checked with the [ORG] people and I said, How did you get [INTERVIEWED] involved in this campaign? And they threw their arms up and they said, He kind of volunteered [INTERVIEWED]. That is true. [INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, he is called many times and said, 'What can I do? ' Why is this so important to you? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [PERSON] and I both spent a lot of time on this, and it is important for [CARDINAL] reasons. [CARDINAL] is, I was in music when I was the age of these children, and I know what it can do. And secondly, I have been very disturbed over [DATE] over [DATE], more and more, as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs. You know, the principals have a lot of problems. They have a lot of challenges they have to meet, and many times the money is not there. And the school districts have cut a lot of these music programs out all over the country. And when I heard what [ORG] was doing, I did kind of volunteer to get involved. I wrote [PERSON] a letter and said, Look, I am for this, and I think we have got to get music back into these schools. A lot of young children we know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education. Not everyone learns in the same way. Not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you say, though I mean, let us say, devil's-advocate it for a second I am a member of the local school board, and I sit down, and I look at the budget, and it is shrinking. And I say, I have got choices. I have to make cuts. I have got school lunches over here. I have books for the library here. I have music education over here. How do you stop me from cutting music education? [INTERVIEWED]. It depends on what your options are. But very often there are some options. And that is what that wonderful movie about music education here in [GPE], Music of the Heart, was about. But what this program tries to do is to encourage the schools to put some money into music education by giving them extra help with instruments and sometimes with other support. And what we have tried to do at the national level, with [ORG] and [ORG] that [PERSON]'s the honorary chair of, is to constantly support music education, to emphasize that the schools that have good music education programs see positive other academic advancements as a result of it, and of course, try to get some more funds for the lower income schools out there. [INTERVIEWER1]. But is the message getting out? I mean, you had music education as a kid; so did I. We took it for granted. We are now in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, and still [DATE], [PERCENT] of schools across this country offer music education as a basic part of the curriculum. [INTERVIEWED]. See, what a lot of people do not know is, over [DATE] and particularly in [DATE], while our school populations have been growing again, a smaller percentage of property-tax payers have kids in the schools. And an awful lot of our schools are funded primarily through the property tax. So the schools have had all kinds of financial problems. Their energy bills go up. A lot of them have substandard physical facilities. They have the need to hire more teachers to teach various academic requirements that may have come in. And they do not want to stop any of their competitive athletic proposals. So the [CARDINAL] things that have suffered most in the schools are the music programs and the art programs, on the [CARDINAL] hand, and the physical education programs for people who are not in competitive team sports. [INTERVIEWER1]. But is this the way it is going to be? I mean, when people like [ORG] come in and they donate money like this, it is great, but it is private and public partnership. Why cannot we find a way, even through [ORG] assistance, to make sure that this is a basic part of education? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we should do that. But the main thing we have to do is to build broader public support for doing it. Let me say, interestingly enough, you asked me the budget question. That is the first question: Well, what would you do if you had all these tough budget decisions? Our research indicates that the number [CARDINAL] factor in whether music education programs stay or come back to schools is strong community involvement pushing for it. In other words, where people at the grassroots want it, the people who make the budget decisions tend to find a way to provide it. And so, what we can best do, I think, is to point out consistently what the overall educational benefits are, number [CARDINAL], and number [CARDINAL], to try to get more Federal assistance out there to the schools to help deal with their big problems. That is why I am trying to get [ORG] to help with school construction and school repair, to help the school districts hire teachers to lower class sizes so they do not have to cut out music to hire that extra teacher when the population goes up, and to get the overall aid to low income schools up. So if we do those things and we get the kind of grassroots support we need, then what [ORG] will be doing is supplementing a growing trend, instead of trying to fill a huge hole. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is it possible to take it a step further? From what I understand now, [ORG] supplies [PERCENT] of funding for schools; local and [ORG] provide the rest. Can you offer [GPE] incentives? Can you say to them, Look, we will provide more funding if you take it upon yourselves to make music education part of your basic curriculum? [INTERVIEWED]. We could do that. I had not thought of that, exactly in that way. What we tried to dolet me just say this. What we have tried to do for [DATE], since I have been [INTERVIEWED], is to say, Look, here are the [ORG]'s education goals. They include music and the arts. And if you come up with a plan to meet those goals, we will give you some help to implement the plan, which included music and the arts. Basically, the specific targeted dollars we have for schools go to schools that have greater financial need, because they have got a higher percentage of low income kids, or to hire more teachers, generally, because the school population is going up. I think if we will stay with the position that we are going to help all the schools that have these goals, which include music and the arts, and then we come in with the big ticket items, which are personnel and school building and repair, and we can build the kind of grassroots support we need, then these music programs will be able to survive. But one of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just took the music programs for granted. A lot of people who were making tough budget decisions assumed nobody would care if they were eliminated. And it was tragic, what happened. So I think what is going to happen you will see a big infusion of public money going back into these programs because of what [ORG] has done and because more and more parents will insist on the music being there. And I will be glad to do whatever I can to help. [INTERVIEWER1]. We are going to take a little break. When we come back, I understand we are joined by another special guest, and we will talk more about music education. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. And we are back with President [PERSON] at [FAC] in East Harlem. Let me ask for a couple of quick answers to some questions in the news. [GPE]: [ORG] is holding hearings on security breaches there. [CARDINAL] hard drives containing nuclear secrets disappeared. Do you think national security was jeopardized? [INTERVIEWED]. It is not clear, but I think it is very important to get to the bottom of it. The [ORG] is investigating it, and we have got Senator [PERSON] and Congressman [PERSON], who have agreed to take an independent look. It is a serious issue, and I think what we ought to do is just see the investigation through and see where the facts lead us. But we need to do what we can to find out what happened, whether there was a security breach, and if so, how we can change it so it will never happen again. [INTERVIEWER1]. You and I were both watching the news earlier about gas prices. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. People in [GPE], [GPE], in particular, paying [MONEY] a gallon more than the rest of us. [INTERVIEWED]. Than anybody else in the country. It is been very frustrating to me. I am quite concerned about it. Let me tell you what we know. We know that the prices were affected by the shutdown of a refinery, which is coming back up, a leak in a pipeline, which is the cheapest way to transport gas, and an unusual increase in demand in the [GPE]-Milwaukee area. And all that affected it. Also, they used the cleaner gasoline, which is more expensive to produce, but that is [MONEY] a gallon. So we know that it would be more expensive for a little while until the transportation and the refinery problems are solved. What we do not know is whether there was any price gouging. So we have got [ORG] looking into that, and we have also had [ORG] and [ORG] looking into it. I am very worried about it. But I am hoping that we can break the logjam on it soon. [INTERVIEWER1] introduced musician [PERSON], who offered his advice to the young musicians present.] [INTERVIEWED]. The only thing I would say is, do not get discouraged early. If you will stay with it long enough, until you like to hear yourself play, then it will be easier for you to keep practicing. But if you play one of these reed instruments, you will squeak a lot. If you play a string instrument, it'll hurt your ears in the beginning. Just stay with it; be patient. And when you reach the point where you like to hear yourself play, then it is all downhill from there. You just keep working. [INTERVIEWER1]. Maybe it is a good time for you to relate to them also. You had a music teacher in your early life who had a pretty strong impact on your life. [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, absolutely I did. I had a well, my high school band director, [PERSON], is still a friend of mine, still writes me to this day. My grade school band director was a man named [PERSON], who had a big impact on me. My vocal my choir teacher when I was in elementary school, I still remember vividly. Her name was [PERSON]. All the kids I knew had access to choir and could be in the band if they wanted to. And I am so glad that [PERSON] and [ORG] and all these people are trying to make it possible for you to do this, because it is something you do not have to I was not as good as [PERSON], see, so I did not get to be a professional musician. But I had a wonderful time. It changed my life for the better. And it still benefits me, and I still play. [INTERVIEWER1]. you have to be thinking a lot about legacy. And you look at young people in the third and fourth grade how do you want them to be a part of your legacy? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I want them to have more opportunity, more educational opportunity, than they had when I became [INTERVIEWED]. And I want them to grow up in a country that is a more just and decent country, where there is less discrimination and where people work together more. And I think that that will be the case. But it is really important that kids are not deprived of opportunities like music, just because of where they happen to live and whether their parents have money or not. That should not be what determines this. [INTERVIEWER1]. Just a suggestion: You have got some free time coming up in [DATE], and [PERSON], you have got a little free time. I am thinking, you go to the garage in [GPE]; you get a little amplifier like you used to do in high school aggravate the neighbors, and put together a little band here. [INTERVIEWED]. I accept. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you so much for coming in. [PERSON], it is always good to see you. [INTERVIEWED], nice to see you, as well. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmaureenbunyanabc7", "text": "About [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], to most [NORP], [GPE] is still part of the axis of evil, its holding [NORP] hostages, and it helps to undermine the middle eastern-middle eastern affairs. Why should [NORP] stomach, and how can [NORP] stomach a deal with a country like that? [INTERVIEWED]. Because we do not want them to get nuclear weapons. It is precisely because [GPE] has been so antagonistic to us, to friends of ours like [GPE], that we have to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. That is been something that has been a top priority of my administration, but also previous [NORP] and [NORP] administrations. That is why we set up [DATE] of the toughest sanctions ever imposed on [GPE] which forced them to negotiate. And that is why we have now put forward a deal in concert with allies like, [GPE], and [GPE], and [GPE] and others, that ensures that all the major pathways for them getting nuclear weapons are shut off. And not only are we achieving a central national security goal of ours, but we are doing it without initiating another military action in the middle east at a time when obviously the middle east is in pretty bad shape. That does not mean that we trust [GPE], it means that we have set up such a vigorous system to inspect and verify that they are not getting a nuclear weapon, making them shut down facilities that would give us cause for concern, that we and most nuclear experts are able to see into what they are doing and ensure that we are not seeing nuclear proliferation in [CARDINAL] of the most volatile parts of the world. [INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned [GPE], our staunchest ally in the middle east, completely, adamantly opposed to this agreement. What are you doing to-to allow that-not to allow our relationship with [GPE] to deteriorate even further? [INTERVIEWED]. Well keep in mind that our relationship militarily in terms of intelligence cooperation with [GPE] has never been stronger. There is a policy disagreement between this administration and everyone else in the world, and prime minister [PERSON] of [GPE]. And while I respect his legitimate concerns about [GPE], as I have said very clearly, he is wrong on this issue. We do not want to have [GPE] get a nuclear weapon and every credible expert who is looked at this says this is the best path for us not to get a nuclear weapon. What we do have to continue to do though is recognize that even with [GPE] not having a nuclear weapon, that they are still engaging activities that are adverse to our interests and our values. And we have to work with not just [GPE], but other partners in the region to make sure that [GPE]'s not sending shipments to terrorist organizations like [ORG], to make sure that they are not destabilizing countries that are very important to us. And that is something that we are already doing and will continue to be committed to doing in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. In [DATE] when you were promoting the Affordable Care Act, you had a lot of allies in [ORG] who were standing at your side and doing some of the heavy lifting for you. In the case of this [GPE] deal, it seems as if you are not getting that kind of support from [ORG], and you are having to do a lot of it yourself, a little arm twisting here and there we understand. [INTERVIEWED]. You know, the truth is that this is probably going to be challenging but not as challenging as getting the Affordable Care Act done. I mean we have got terrific Senators, like [PERSON] in [GPE], who have stood up and made a very clear case as to why this is important to do. And I am very confident that this deal will go forward. It is unfortunate that we had [NORP] who immediately, uniformly opposed the deal, before the deal was even signed and before they had even read it. But you know one of the things that I have noticed is there was an initial interim deal that we did with [GPE] during the course of the talks, that the same folks expressed skepticism towards, [DATE] because it actually shut down any expansion of [GPE]'s nuclear program and worked exactly the way it was designed, suddenly they now all think it was a good deal. So you know the politics of these things [DATE] are going to be very different than the politics [DATE] or [DATE] when people see that we have been able to shut off [GPE]'s nuclear program from advancing in a way that could pose a threat to us. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much sir. [INTERVIEWED]. It was great to talk to you, thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. My pleasure.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmayarhodantime", "text": "[PERSON] Well thank you both so much for joining us [DATE]. My hope is that this is more of a conversation than an interview. So we will just let you guys talk. I am going to be obviously jumping in with questions. But we want it to be natural and fun. And I want to start off by saying that you guys have a lot more in common than I am sure a lot of people know. You are both born into multiracial families, you were raised by single mothers. And you have risen to the top of your respective fields as [NORP]. Which is pretty notable. But I am curious, what do you see in each other that you recognize in yourself? Like what is it, and is there a common thread that has allowed you both to succeed? [INTERVIEWED1]. Well first of all, I thought you were going to say that I am also a really good dancer. I thought about it. I saw you dancing with a [DATE]. That is not the common thread. So I was a little let down as you, that was not the common thread that she picked up on. Well first of all, I mean I could not be prouder of what [PERSON]'s done You know, as the father of [CARDINAL] daughters, one of the things I am always looking for are strong women who are out there who are breaking barriers and doing great stuff. And [PERSON]'s a great example of that. Somebody who has entered a field that is very competitive, where the assumptions are that she may not belong. And through sheer force of will and determination and incredible talent and hard work she was able to arrive at the pinnacle of her field. And that is exciting. The other thing is, as a father of [CARDINAL] daughters, seeing how images of strong athletic accomplished women carry over, and encouraging them in sports and dance and how they move physically, it turns out that every study shows that young girls who are involved in sports, dance, athletics end up having more confidence generally. And across the board in everything that they do end up being more assertive, happier. So this is one of the reasons why having [PERSON] on [ORG] has been so important. I think that there is a sense of humbleness and humility, and there is a human that is within you. And I think that that is something that I can relate to and connect with that people are drawn to. And they feel this genuineness coming from you. And I think that it allows you to rise to this level, and not feel this pressure that is kind of pushing you down, but allows you to take the responsibility with a sense of pride. And again just being grounded. And I feel like as I am embarking on [DATE] as a principal dancer I am experiencing something that I did not prepare myself for, I think emotionally and mentally and psychologically. When you have all of these expectations and goals to reach this point that [PERCENT] get to, you know how do you ? what do you do when you get there? How do you stay grounded and humble and striving? And I think that is on a much smaller scale for me, but something that I feel I can relate to with you that I cannot imagine you must have experienced. Well, you know, it is interesting, this whole notion of when you arrive. I do not know how it felt for you, but certainly for me, you know probably I burst out onto the national scene with the Democratic Convention speech of [DATE]. And that was the first time that I had a big national audience. And everybody responded really favorably. And so I got a lot of attention and interviews and magazine pieces and all this stuff. And I still remember telling [PERSON] and my closest friends, I said I am not any smarter [DATE] than I was [DATE], right. In some ways, when you struggle for a while, and you have had the ability of being an ordinary person and you have gone shopping, changed diapers and tried to figure out how to pay the bills and so forth, so that you are not some overnight success. Then handling some of these issues ends up being easier because you have a better sense of perspective. You do not sense somehow that this is because I am just so special, or because I am so much smarter than that other person. Because in fact you have known those other people who are talented and smart and capable. In some ways you got a break, you were lucky. And that, for me at least keeps me grounded because it reminds me that, you know, for all the blessings and privileges and responsibilities that I have gotten, I am just representing a huge cross section of people who are talented and capable and supported me getting to where I came from. So that takes a little bit of the edge off. And more importantly, it means that your friends do not start looking at you and thinking oh, you are acting kind of like you are all that, right. And it is good to have friends who will do that for you. If you start acting weird, they are like -- Check you. Yeah. It is like what, suddenly you are some prima ballerina? Please. I remember when ? and they will remind you of some story. Okay. That is helpful. And you both represent the [NORP] community. As [INTERVIEWED1] of [GPE], as a principal dancer for [ORG], do you ever think that ? how does race come to play? Do you think that people still treat you differently because of race? Because you are [NORP]? You know, my experience has been that a lot of what I have experienced has not always been to my face, or it is been very subtle. But it is in a way that I know what is going on and I feel it deep inside of me. And I, being the only African American in almost every environment in terms of classical ballet, it weighs on you and it wears on you after a while. And I feel like a lot of it as well is what I am kind of putting on myself. And this just trying to not get too caught up and too wrapped up and too weighed down with being black and trying to just be the best person and the best dancer that I can be. And work, and work harder than, even if I see the person next to me that things may be a little bit easier for them, I am going to try and push myself even harder than them. But I think that being [NORP] has definitely been a huge obstacle for me. But it is also allowed me to have this fire inside of me that I do not know if I would have or have had if I were not in this field. Well part of classical ballet that makes it challenging is that there is a very set way of doing things. There is sort of this canon that people want it just a certain way, or they want it to look a certain way. So do you find now that you are in a position where you can start pushing the barriers a little bit and the boundaries in terms of what people expect? Now that you have established that alright, I can do this, so let me also do that. Or I can master that style, and so now can we introduce something a little bit different? How much of that takes place? Absolutely. I mean I think that having a platform and having a voice to be seen by people beyond the classical ballet world has really been my power I feel. It is allowed me to say, it is okay to have a healthy athletic body. We are fully capable of doing everything that the person who does not have an extremely athletic body, that is more thin. We are fully capable of doing exactly the same thing. And I think that being in this position and showing that I can execute and do all of these things that it is possible to have any skin complexion, to have a healthy body image for the ballerina body. I think it is given me more of a voice. And it is I think forcing a lot of these top tier companies to address the lack of diversity and diversifying the bodies that we are seeing in classical ballet. It is really forcing that conversation to be had. I have to say as an outside, I do not know if you feel the same way. When I hear that like your body type is considered sort of more athletic or large, you are tiny. For those of you who are watching, you may not be able to see. I mean, you are petite. Yes. So the notion that somehow that was even a question is pretty interesting. Yeah, I mean I think it is how ? I think it is a lot of the language and how we use it. And I think for a lot of people of color, that seems to be an easy way or a way out by saying you do not fit in. It may be it is your skin color. It may be the texture of your hair. Whatever it is. We want a certain look. Yeah. And I think that is an easy way of addressing that. Interesting. As a father of [CARDINAL] daughters, do you see that at all? Do you see that pressure in your own life? Yeah. I mean some of this is just gender issues, generally. I mean when you are a dad of [CARDINAL] daughters you notice more. When I was a kid I did not realize as much, or maybe it was even a part of which is the enormous pressure that young women are placed under in terms of looking a certain way. And being cute in a certain way. And are you wearing the right clothes? And is your hair done the right way. And that pressure I think is historically always been harder on [NORP] women than just about any other women. But it is part and parcel of a broader way in which we socialize and press women to constantly doubt themselves or define themselves in terms of a certain appearance. And so [PERSON] and I are always guarding against that. And the fact that they have got a tall gorgeous mom who has some curves, and that their father appreciates, I think is helpful. I do think that culture's changing for the younger generation a little bit more. You see [PERSON] or you see some of these pop stars and what both white, [NORP], black children are seeing as representative of beauty is much broader than it was when I was a kid. You just did not see that much representation. And that is healthy and that is encouraging. But it is still a challenge. I mean [PERSON] will talk about black girl's hair and will have much opinions of that. And she is pretty opinionated about the fact that it costs a lot, it takes a long time, that sometimes girls can be just as tough on each other about how they are supposed to look. And so it is , as a parent, that is a constant learning process that you are trying to hold the fort. And that is why somebody like [PERSON] ends up being so important. A lot of it is the power of that image, even if they are not dancers, even if they are not interested in pursuing a career in entertainment or the arts. For them to know that that is valued end up making a big difference. And beyond the just simply being there, that obviously makes a difference. But then there is also a pressure like you mentioned to do more. And I am curious also what you make of social movements like Black Girl Magic, when there is like these grassroots level reinforcement of these ideas that black is beautiful, in a sense? It is so important for this generation. And to use social media to have a positive impact on our generation is huge. And I know that you have a presence as well. And it is such a part ? I think we have to be involved I think in order to really reach the younger generation on social media. But to have movements like Black Girl Magic, I think it could not be more positive for a young black girl to see that it is okay to be yourself, it is okay to not have to transform and look like what you may see on the cover of a lot of magazines. That you are beautiful, that it is possible to succeed in any field that you want to, looking the way that you do. With your hair the way it is. I think all of that is so extremely important and something that I am constantly celebrating. That something that I fought so hard for throughout the beginning of my career is I did not want to pancake my skin a lighter color to fit into the ... ballet. I wanted to be myself. I did not want to have to wear makeup that made my nose look thinner. There are just ? it is important I think with this generation of young minorities, children especially, to feel comfortable and confident in their skin. Well social media obviously is the way in which young people are receiving information in general. So the power of young activists to help shape color and politics through things like Black Lives Matter, which I think is hugely important. And when I think about the journey I have traveled, there is no doubt that young [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], LGBT youth, they have more role models. They have more folks that they can immediately identify with. And that, in and of itself is of value. But what we also have to remember is that the barriers that exist for them to pursue their dreams are deep and structural. And so it is wonderful that the potential dancer can see [PERSON] and say, I can do that. But if there is no dance studio at all in their neighborhood, and if their schools do not offer any extracurricular activities at all, or if their school is chronically underfunded, then it is going to be a problem. I hope that there are young men of color who are looking at me and saying, I can aspire to be [INTERVIEWED1], or a senator, or a community organizer and make change in my neighborhoods. But if they are locked out of opportunity, and in neighborhoods where even if I am on television, there are no men in their neighborhoods who've got jobs that are able to support a family, then you have still got problems. So I think culture, changing attitudes is hugely important. You know we are for example trying to get more girls and women to study the stem subjects, math, science, engineering. Because they are chronically under-represented. And in researching this we found out that for example, since CSI came on, and there are women who are doing forensic investigations, that the number of women who are in this field has skyrocketed, right. So some of it is just okay, I now picture myself as doing that. But I think it is important for us to remember that it is not just a matter of providing us a strong image, it is also making sure that they have got good schools, making sure that they are getting programs that allow them to explore all their talents. Making sure that the economy is working in a way that gives everybody a chance to succeed. It is a both and rather than an either or proposition. Well how do you make sure those things are protected when you see, for example Affirmative Action in the balance again? Is that something that is important in academics and the arts for example? Well I ? look, I am a strong supporter of Affirmative Action as a way of opening more doors. And I think there are ways of structuring [ORG] so that everybody's getting more of a chance. And the truth of the matter is, there is always been [ORG], it just has not always been minority focused, right. If you make a big donation to a university, your kid is more likely to get into the university. It is not called [ORG], it is called legacies. And so for a school, for a dance program, for a political organization to say we are going to actively seek out and recruit talent that has not had insight into this field before, this world before. We are going to have a bunch of young girls come into [ORG] and just watch, and get a workshop, and have them imagine themselves on that stage. You know, because they are much less likely to have a program available to them in their community or to have parents who even know about ballet. Well, that is something that is extraordinarily valuable. And I think we can sustain, while not being so rigid that it ends up locking anybody else out of an opportunity. I absolutely agree. I mean I think it is so completely necessary. Especially when you are dealing with a field that is never really been open to reaching out to communities that do not have the access, that do not have the exposure and the means to be a part of something especially that is so niche as the classical ballet world. And I think that it is a responsibility that I feel. You know, being the only [NORP] at this level in [ORG], I feel like people are looking at me, and it is my responsibility for me to do whatever I can to provide these opportunities in communities to be able to educate them. And if that means having a program just for black dancers to allow them to have the same opportunity that generations and generations of white dancers have had, it is necessary. Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I have got something called My Brother's Keeper that we have been mobilizing all across the country. And the notion is, if we can reach young men of color, who so often are channeled into destructive behavior or into dropping out of school and ending up in the prison pipeline. If we can just expose them to what their possibilities are, link them with a mentor, work with the institutions like schools to say, examine what your policies are on suspensions and expulsions to make sure that black boys or [NORP] boys are not being treated differently. What you do is to ? what you discover through this process is how much talent is there untapped. And we bring in some mentees to [ORG] [DATE]. And I have lunch with them and we pair them up with senior advisors. And a lot of them have never even been into an office setting before. A lot of them do not know what it means to be a secret service agent. Or what would be required for them to pursue a professional degree. And we have been doing this for [DATE] now, and we are already seeing how the horizons that these young men suddenly have for themselves starts rising. And the great thing is we have been able to duplicate this in [CARDINAL] of cities across the country. You are seeing companies step up saying we are willing to bring in somebody for [DATE] so that they can get exposed to what a law firm looks like, or what an accounting firm looks like. And that then provides the motivation for these young people to navigate and take ? make better choices in their own lives. Because ultimately, I am sure [PERSON] feels this, I certainly feel it, we would not have succeeded if we had not worked hard. You cannot replace hard work and initiative and discipline and sacrifice, and delayed gratification. There are all kinds of things you give up along whatever path to success you have chosen. But part of what inspires you to make those sacrifices is the sense that I might actually succeed, you know. And so much of what we want to do with our young people is persuade them to dream big, and to not feel that somehow their circumstances at birth, or the circumstances of their upbringing or poverty or race in any way inhibits them. You have to be honest with them and say yeah, it is going to be harder for you than it might have been for somebody else. But that is okay. It turns out that kids are extraordinarily resilient if they feel like they can actually make something happen. Looking back, was there anything that someone told either of you about race, or did not tell you about race that you wish they had or that you feel like you had to learn on your own? And how does that impact how you talk to young people [DATE]? I feel like my mom pretty much covered everything with me. Being biracial she made it very clear to me that yes, you are [NORP] and you are [NORP] and you are black, but you are going to be viewed by the world and by society as a black woman and you should be prepared for that. I think that I, being very shy going into a setting where I was the only black woman, allowed me to observe more, rather than react. And I think that saved me a lot. And it taught me a lot. And it has allowed me to, when I am interacting with my mentees to say to them, you know, there are just ways that you have to approach situations that may be difficult or may not be fair, but it is how you represent yourself. You may be carrying a responsibility that you do not want, but it is what it is being [NORP] and being in certain environments. It does not matter if you are a ballet dancer, if you are an attorney, whatever it is you are trying to do, you are going to be faced with these obstacles. You know, I mean I think about this now as a parent. [PERSON] and I are having a lot of conversations around the dinner table. And for me, what I always try to transmit to my kids is that issues of race, discrimination, tragic history of slavery and [PERSON], all those things are real. And you have to understand them and you have to be knowledgeable about them. And recognize that they did not stop [TIME]. Certainly not just when I was elected. I remember people talking about how somehow this was going to solve all our racial problems. I was not one of those who subscribed to that notion. And, but what I want them to draw from it is a sense of justice for everybody. My view is that the strength of having been a minority on the receiving end of discrimination is that it should make you that much more attuned and empathetic towards anybody who is vulnerable. Towards anybody who is being locked out. So what I say to my kids is use this as something that provides you a particular power to be willing to fight on behalf of what you think is right. And that includes thinking about and being concerned with the struggles that whites have in this society as well. You know part of what I think is sometimes difficult, but I think absolutely necessary for black activists like those who are engaging in some of the protests around [GPE] etc., is to try to also get yourself in the mindset of a police officer who is scared. And who is trying to figure out how to navigate a really challenging job and wants to get home safe. And may make a split second decision. And how are they being trained? And are they being provided enough guidance from their bosses that will steer them in a better direction than the worst direction? That is hard to do because it is easier to just kind of say, be angry and frustrated. And part of what I think successful social movements have involved is having a certain righteous anger about injustices being done to you, but also understanding that people who are on the other side of this, they have got their own history and their own circumstances. And you have to understand that, and you have to recognize that each of us has some good and some bad in is. And that is not an excuse, but what it does do is it gives us an opportunity then to have a conversation and to reach across the divide. And that is not something that always, at a time when so much of communications is sound-bytes and tweets, cable news, it is hard to have that kind of conversation. It is easier I think to just make everything very black and white. But I think that when you look at how social changes happened throughout history, including in our country, it is been because we can project ourselves into the circumstances of other people. And hopefully that is something that [PERSON] and [PERSON] and her generation is picking up on. And I think they have. And wrapping things up. What do you see as the single greatest fixable obstacle to the success of young people [DATE]? The single, wow. I think ? I mean everything that you were saying, being able to have an understanding of yourself and how you fit into society and who you are. But to be empathetic to everyone around you I think is such a powerful thing to hold. To be able to forgive. All of those things I think can strengthen this generation of our youth. I think having a strong sense of self and just knowing who they are and being comfortable with that. Well, you know, I spend most of my time thinking about institutions. And there is no doubt, even though it is a clich? that the single biggest difference we can make is making sure that our kids get a good education. We can do a lot to keep the economy moving forward, we can do a lot to make sure that we are enforcing our nondiscrimination laws. We can do a lot more to open up people's perspective about who belongs where. And press to make sure that we have more women CEOs, and more [NORP] film directors. And more [NORP] police officers. And all those things are important. But the foundation that all this depends is making sure that on the front end, when these little babies are born and start to get curious about the world and are like sponges, that we are giving them the kind of education and the nurturing that they need. So that they are off to a good start. And that involves an imaginative leap, a moral leap on the part of the society as a whole that says every kid should get a genuine opportunity and we are willing to put money behind it, and we are willing to invest in that to break cycles of poverty. And to reach out and pull kids up, even if they are not born into the best of circumstances. And that is hard to do. Because we are working off of a legacy of [DATE] of discrimination that gets passed on generationally. If we could decide [DATE] that there was no discrimination, that we had some new drug that everybody took and suddenly nobody would be racially prejudiced. We still have a whole bunch of really poor kids who need help. And that still requires us making investments in them. And that means that all of us, the government, private sector, nonprofits, have to make some sacrifices so that those kids are getting an opportunity. And if you talk to the average person, they embrace that idea. One of the great things about being president is you get to meet people from all walks of life. And ... people are fundamentally good people. And they want to do the right thing. And if you ask them should every child have an opportunity, they will tell you yes. But, if you tell them okay, that may mean we have got to spend more tax dollars to provide them with better schools. And the teachers have to be paid more. And we have to make sure that they have got computer equipment in their schools, and arts and music programs are not a luxury, they are something that helps that child thrive. Then people start saying well, you know, I have got my own bills to pay. And I moved into this good school district and I want to make sure that that school district maintains its advantages. And I am not sure whether the money's going to be well spent. We find all kinds of excuses why we do not actually do it, move that agenda forward. And part of my goal, through things like My Brother's Keeper, part of [PERSON]'s goal to ? an initiative she is got called Let Girls Learn, is to keep on creating more and more avenues where we as a society can have that conversation and actually move forward and do the right thing. If we do that, we are not going to eliminate racism and prejudice entirely in this society. But what we can do is to greatly lessen how much it determines the life chances of people. And that should be our goal. Great. Well thank you both so much for chatting with us. This has been really great. And lastly, did you guys catch the game on [DATE]? Is [PERSON] the greatest, or is he just great? [PERSON] is the greatest shooter that I have ever seen. You knew I had an opinion on this. And, and I am having more fun watching him than anybody since [PERSON]. I was going to ask, is he better than [PERSON]? He is pretty remarkable. He is not ? even [PERSON] would not necessarily say he is better than [PERSON]. But he is ? the fact that he is about my size and he is doing what he is doing. And I think the growth has been tremendous, I can imagine where he is going to go. It is, that is a great point. It is rare where you get somebody who is already at the pinnacle and then they take it another notch higher. And he is a wonderful young man. He is a lot of run. Well thank you. It is great to see you. Thank you, I enjoyed it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmeganglaroscbssthismorning", "text": "AboutSearch The big news story of [DATE] [DATE] and obviously PresidentJonathan accepting [GPE] aid to help the girls in [GPE]. So what help will we provide? And do you think at this point with [DATE] in, is it too late? We are sending in a team made up of our military and law enforcement and other experts, and we are very glad that [GPE] has accepted the help. Obviously what is happening is awful. And as a father of [CARDINAL] girls, I cannot imagine what the parents are going through. But this organization, [ORG], has been one of the worst regional or local terrorist organizations in the world. We'd long sought to work with [GPE] on dealing with them. And we are going to do everything we can to assist them in recovering these young women. More broadly though we are gonna have to really tackle a pernicious problem inside that county-a an organization that is carried out ruthless attacks and killed [CARDINAL] of people over [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED], Climate, climate change in general can be such a partisan issue. There is now bipartisan support for [FAC]. They are claiming energy efficiency. In light of all the data coming in with this new report, talking about carbon emissions, are you more onboard or are you concerned at this point? Well, the climate assessment plan was done over the course of [DATE], talking to [CARDINAL] of experts across the country, the private sector, not-for profits. And, the assessment is clear. Not only is climate change a problem in the future. It is already affecting [NORP]. It is increasing the likelihood of floods. Increasing the likelihood of drought. It is increasing the likelihood of storms and hurricanes. It is having an impact on our agriculture. It is having an impact on our tourism industries. And people's lives are at risk. So, the emphasis on the Climate Action Plan that I have put forward as well as this assessment is there are things we can do about it, but it is only going to happen if the [NORP] people and people around the world take the challenge seriously. And, we have already increased our production of solar and wind power. We have already increased fuel efficiency standards on cars, and now we are going to appliances. But we are gonna have to do more. And that should be a bipartisan issue, because always want to make sure that we are passing on an [NORP] to our kids and grandkids that is as beautiful as the one that we inherited. And Sir, climate change is the kind of thing a lot of people do not put as a top priority. How do you change that? Hopefully, by publicizing the fact that there are real costs, not out in the distant future, but right now. We cannot attribute any single weather event to climate change. But we know that if temperatures are rising, you are going to see more extreme weather events. And that means that more people are at risk. More homes are lost. More lives are potentially lost. It is going to impact people in severe, significant ways that cost money. And so for us to make some decisions now uh as opposed to putting this off, may seem as though we are dealing with something that we do not have to deal with until later. But in fact we will end up saving money and lives over the long term. And I think that is something that most [NORP] understand.", "discourse_type": 1}

The [ORG] lead [ORG] [CARDINAL]-2. It is [DATE], and [INTERVIEWED] was here [DATE] to throw out the first ball, and he will be joining us momentarily, as soon as we get him miked up. Well, we have got [CARDINAL] right-handers, myself and [PERSON], and [CARDINAL] left-handers in the booth now, [PERSON] and [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWER1]. We finally have some balance up here. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can we get a [INTERVIEWED] chair in here? Thank you very much. How are you, sir? [INTERVIEWED]. Great. It is been a good game, do not you think? [INTERVIEWER1]. I agree. [INTERVIEWED]. And [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. What was that first pitch you threw? Fastball, slider, curve? [INTERVIEWED]. It was not fast. It was not fast, but I had a good time. [INTERVIEWER1]. This is a good time of [DATE] for you. I know you are a big college basketball fan, having gone to [GPE]. Unfortunately, the [ORG] were eliminated, did not make it to the finals. [INTERVIEWED]. But I am very proud of them. They started [CARDINAL] freshmen and made it to the Sweet 16, so I think they did well. It was a great tournament [DATE], I think. Everybody who watched the games must have felt it was a great tournament. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know you love being here on [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. I do. And this has been exciting, you know? It is great to see this new [GPE] team. You know, they have got a chance to go all the way. And yet, if my count's right, all their RBI's go to Mr. [PERSON] [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. That is right. [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, he got [PERCENT] of what he had in all spring training. And of course, they all want to get to [FAC], because I know you had [ORG] there in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. I did. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know you get out to a game or [CARDINAL] during the season. Do you watch at [FAC] when you are home? [INTERVIEWED]. I do [INTERVIEWER1]uite often, I do. I watch the games when they are on, especially at [TIME]. When I come home [TIME] and I am kind of keyed up and I do not want to go to sleep, I often watch the games that are on. [INTERVIEWER1]. A drive to right center field. [PERSON] makes the catch on the warning track. [INTERVIEWED]. Great play. That is a great play. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] taking an extra base hit away from [PERSON]. So you were saying you watch our games [TIME]. I guess in essence what you are saying is that we put you to sleep. [INTERVIEWED]. Or keep me awake. [INTERVIEWER1]. This is the youngster that [DATE], at [ORG], got [CARDINAL] at bats, but the reason [PERSON] left him in center field, even though they have a very good center fielder in [PERSON], is because of his ability to make plays like that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Here is [PERSON], who struck out his first time up. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did you play baseball yourself in high school? [INTERVIEWED]. My school did not have a team, but we had church league and [ORG]. We had all those. I played in some of those teams when I was a kid. I loved it. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know you love to golf; did you play any other sports growing up? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but only not in school; I played church league basketball, softball, baseball, but you know, everybody that grew up where I did wound up loving sports. [INTERVIEWER1]. Now, are you allowed to have a favorite team? [INTERVIEWED]. I think so. In [DATE] in the basketball season, excuse me, people understand it when I cheer for my home [ORG] team or for my alma mater, [ORG]. And when I was a kid, interestingly enough, in [GPE], [ORG] were the closest baseball team to us; there were no [GPE] teams then. And so we used to listen to [ORG] baseball. That is what I studied to when I was a boy. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that right? [INTERVIEWED]. Yeah. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know you were out here [DATE] when [PERSON] broke [PERSON] consecutive game streak. [INTERVIEWED]. I was. [INTERVIEWER1]. What did that mean to you? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it meant a lot to me not only as a baseball fan but as a citizen and as [INTERVIEWED] now, as someone who really wants his country to work well. The idea that a man could show that kind of discipline and devotion to his work and stay with one team for a career in a time and age when a lot of people do not last very long because they do not have the discipline to do it and just go for the big-time bucks in the short run and float around from team to team, or in the case of non-athletes from company to company, I think it really sort of was reassuring, not only to me but to the [NORP] people, to see that kind of record set and to see that kind of discipline and loyalty. I liked it a lot. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you aware that [PERSON], is a Presidential candidate and has promised, if elected, to let people not pay taxes for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am worried about that. I am worried about him. I figure that-at the very least he is going to take more votes away from me than Senator [PERSON]. [Laughter] I am really worried about it. I think-you know, I have always been a big fan of his. I feel sort of stabbed by it. It is breaking my heart. [INTERVIEWER1]. You would not consider that, would you? [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER1]. Not having taxes for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. What I want to know is how he is going to pay the bills. I will consider it. I want to hear the rest of the deal. How is he going to not pay the bills? [INTERVIEWER1]. Base hit for [PERSON], who is [CARDINAL] for [CARDINAL] a double his first time up and now a single. So that is a good sign. [PERSON] is back healthy and swinging the bat well. [INTERVIEWED]. Looking good. [INTERVIEWER1]. Getting back to [PERSON] and all of the pressure that he must have been under [DATE] during that streak and you can certainly identify with pressure in your office what do you see about the way he handled the pressure? [INTERVIEWED]. I think he did what I try to do; he did not vary his routine. He just focused on [DATE] that was before him. And I think that he must have had the record in mind, but it did not paralyze his play. Even the night he was here, the night he broke the record, he hit a home run on a [CARDINAL]-3 pitch. So he still had enough presence of mind not to even just take the walk, you know? He was there, ready. He was playing. He was alive to every moment, and I think that is what you have to do. When you are under a lot of pressure, you have to just take a deep breath and do what you know to do. [INTERVIEWER1]. Pitch is low to [PERSON], who has struck out and grounded out. We are visiting with [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. I think you have got to give a lot of credit to conditioning, too. And the way he keeps himself in shape in [DATE] and during the season must have an incredible amount to do with the fact that he was able to play relatively injury-free all these years. And that re[INTERVIEWER1]uires a lot of discipline. [INTERVIEWER1]. And you know, a lot of discipline [PERSON] and I played for the [ORG] for a number of years, and a lot of people wonder what it is like to play in the big league. Are you enjoying being President? Is it what you thought it was going to be? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Oh, yes, I enjoy it very much. I am honored [DATE] when I go to work. There are some parts of it that are a little rougher than I thought it would be, but I have no complaints. I signed on for the whole show, and I am just honored to have a chance to do it, to make a difference, to stand up for what I believe in, and to serve. It is an incredible opportunity, and if I had it to do over again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. [INTERVIEWER1]. There are no off days as [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. No. But I always tell everybody [INTERVIEWER1]. Even [ORG] gets one off in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. even the bad days are good, you know? Even the bad days are good. You know, the only frustrating thing is when you come up against a problem that you know cries out for some sort of resolution, and you are not sure you have the power to do anything about it; or when you get a problem where it seems [CARDINAL]-50 on both sides, you just have to kind of feel your way through to the answer, but you are not neither you nor anyone else can be sure about whether it will come out all right. Those things are frustrating, but in terms of the pressure and the tension of the job, I do not mind that at all. I like it. It is part of the challenge. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], the count to [PERSON]. [PERSON] is at first with [CARDINAL] outs. [INTERVIEWED]. Come on, [PERSON], you need a hit. [INTERVIEWER1]. There goes [PERSON], throw to second by [PERSON]. He bounces it. [INTERVIEWED]. He made it. [INTERVIEWER1]. But it gets him anyway. [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER1]. You do not think so, [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think so. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, maybe we can get the umpire to change his mind. [INTERVIEWER1]. Could we appeal? [INTERVIEWED]. No, no. I went to see the umpires before the game. Let us look again. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did they have their glasses on? [INTERVIEWED]. Yeah, they got him. [INTERVIEWER1]. They did. [INTERVIEWED]. They got him. He was right. [INTERVIEWER1]. We will be back, [INTERVIEWED], in [TIME]. Take a commercial break; we will be right back. [INTERVIEWER1]. Welcome back to [FAC]. [PERSON] with [PERSON], [PERSON]. We are visiting with [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE], [INTERVIEWED], who is enjoying [DATE] here at the ball park. Good to have you with us. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. It is really beautiful here, is not it? Fabulous park. [INTERVIEWER1]. We think it is the best. [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] nice thing is, look how hard the wind is blowing, and you see the flags up there, and yet it is kind of calm in here, so it does not seem to be distracting the game. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] will lead off the fifth inning for the [ORG], with the [ORG] ahead [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. [PERSON] was called out on strikes his first time up. We were talking about your job and the enjoyment you derive from it, but what is the biggest challenge you have faced so far since you have been in office? [INTERVIEWED]. The initial challenge was to try to get the economy turned around and get the deficit down, get the interest rates down, get the jobs coming back into the economy. Now the big frustration is how to make how to get that economic benefit of we have [CARDINAL] new jobs in the economy. Unemployment is low, lower than the last [DATE] average. But there is still a lot of people that feel uncertain, because things are changing so fast. And now the biggest challenge is figuring out how to keep the job machine going and still give the baseball fans in [GPE], the working people, the security that they deserve while they are on the job, some certainty that if they work harder they can get a raise, they can have a retirement, they can provide health care for their kids, that kind of thing. And no one knows how to do this. It is a new challenge. We have never had a time before when we generated so many new jobs, and the economy was performing well, but we still have people uncertain out there. So that is our biggest challenge [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] out, [PERSON] up for the [ORG]. He doubled and scored his first time up. We were talking about somewhat of a background in sports as a youngster. Did you take any lessons away from competition that you use now in your life and on the job? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. [CARDINAL], particularly. No matter how good you are at what you are doing, most things work out better when teams do it together. People work better together than they do on their own most of the time. And the second lesson is the obvious one: Never give up. It is not over till it is over. [INTERVIEWER1]. Were you very frustrated as a sports fan during the baseball strike? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, very. Especially [DATE]. It is something that you can identify with as a pitcher. It was [DATE] in [DATE]. I mean, for people like me that grew up memorizing the baseball statistics, not just of all of my heroes in [DATE] when I was a boy but going back to the [DATE] and [DATE], I knew the hitting records of all the old players. The idea that we were going to have a literally a [DATE] record in hitting. And I know there are all kind of reasons for it, the expansion teams. I know all that. But to see that just thrown away, it just broke my heart. For all of us nuts, it was a bad deal. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thanks for being with us, sir. It is been a pleasure. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks. [INTERVIEWER1]. Come back anytime. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. This, however, is going to be [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah, I imagine, and [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE] for baseball. [INTERVIEWER1]. And also [DATE] for you. [INTERVIEWED]. But I will still keep up. [INTERVIEWER1]. Okay. Good luck. Nice seeing you. [INTERVIEWER1]. A real pleasure. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. We will be back with more from [FAC] in [TIME]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Give me a golf game [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Okay. You got a deal.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmemberstheeditorialboardthenewyorkpostnewyorkcity", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1] Well, [INTERVIEWED], first of all our genuine appreciation for sparing us the time. We know your schedule is very busy, and we know that time is limited. So, we'd like to get down to business right away. [INTERVIEWED]. All right. Well, let me say I am appreciating your paper and its upholding of our country and the principles that involved and so forth very refreshing. [INTERVIEWER1] Well, we shall continue to do so. [GPE] [INTERVIEWED], it would seem that congratulations are in order over your efforts to bring about a [GPE] cease-fire. However, all Mideast cease-fires seem to be fragile at best, and we are wondering what are the contingency plans if the cease-fire breaks down. Secretary [PERSON] has said there is no timetable to pull out the marines, says that goes for the [ORG] as well. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I think right now this is a first step. We know that it is a tenuous one and that it is a very complex problem that has to be worked out. But it is right in line with the mission that took the whole multinational force there to be in a position to help preserve stability as a government of [GPE] reinstitutes its sovereignty over its own territory and the foreign forces get out. [INTERVIEWER1] [INTERVIEWED], you said [DATE] that the [NORP] played an important part in the helping to bring the cease-fire about. Did they put pressure on [GPE] by threatening to withhold their bankrolling? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know of any pressure of that kind. But I do know that just as we had [CARDINAL] ambassadors there who were back and forth working virtually around the clock, trying to bring the various parties together, they were most helpful in doing the same thing and, I think, have to be recognized for that. So, I would not know what persuasion was used or anything else, but finally we have the cease-fire. [INTERVIEWER1] On [DATE], [PERSON] and others will be forming the committee for your reelection. Can you say at this stage if you have made up your mind to run? If not, will you at least endorse Mr. [PERSON]'s committee? [INTERVIEWED]. At least I would endorse what? [INTERVIEWER1] Mr. [PERSON]'s committee. [INTERVIEWED]. Oh. Well, no, let me just say I do not think this is a time when I can make an answer of any kind to that question. First of all, I believe that campaigns are too long anyway. But I have said there is no way that I am going to make or announce a decision until the last possible moment that it could be done, because either way it is going to make things difficult. If you are not a candidate, you are a lameduck, and if you are a candidate, suddenly everything you try to accomplish is viewed as part of the political campaign. So, I know there is coming a day when I am going to have to make a statement, but not now. [INTERVIEWER1] Have you discussed the possibilities yet with your family? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously this has come up in conversation. [INTERVIEWER1] Will you endorse the committee that is being formed, though? Is it with your blessing? [INTERVIEWED]. That would be getting into the area of commenting that I still do not think I should. [INTERVIEWER1] When do you think, [INTERVIEWED], [DATE] may come when you will have to make a decision public? Do you see it within [DATE] or so, perhaps? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have not set any specific date, and so I will not hazard one. But, as I say, I know that such a day is coming, that there is reality alone says that a decision must be announced. [INTERVIEWER1] You had a rather historic meeting of prayer with Cardinal [PERSON] [DATE]. How did you find that very brave man? [INTERVIEWED]. Very brave. And it was just amazing. He expressed his interest in so much that is going on in the world and some of the things that we are trying to do. And it was a moving experience. But also we were so grateful for the opportunity to see him and have this meeting with him. They had arranged a little prayer service in his chapel, but not with him present. But we then went to his room, and he concluded the service before our visit with the final prayer. [INTERVIEWER1] Senator [PERSON] of [GPE] and many others have been very forceful in their language calling for Mr. [PERSON] to resign. What are your views about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think Mr. [PERSON] has done a very capable job as Secretary of [ORG]. I think we have to point out with all of this that it was an unfortunate remark. It certainly was a mistake, and he has admitted that both those points. He has apologized not only to me, but he is apologized to the people on the [ORG] for that. But I think in all fairness we have to recognize that, yes, it was a very improper thing to say, but it certainly was not said in the sense of any bitterness or bigotry or prejudice. If I thought he was bigoted or prejudiced, he would not be a part of our administration. It was an attempt at lightness that, as we all have to admit, fell very fiat. And it was unfortunate. So, I think that we have to recognize that, hope it will not be repeated. [INTERVIEWER1] Do you think it'd be possible for him to continue in office? [INTERVIEWED]. What is that? [INTERVIEWER1] Do you think it would be possible for him to continue in office? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that is a decision that he, himself, would have to make, whether he feels that he has made it questionable as to whether he can be effective or not. [INTERVIEWER1] You have no plans, [INTERVIEWED], to ask him to leave, then? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I accepted his apology. [INTERVIEWER1] If we could turn to your speech at [ORG] [DATE], which is very calm and very measured. Had you, while you were preparing the speech, had any indication or signal of any sort that your proposals might be agreeable to the [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you can always hope. What I said [DATE] I have thought for some time the things that needed saying, both with regard to [ORG] and to their approach to these matters. I just feel very deeply that if and when I remarked about governments starting wars, that if the representatives of [GPE] and ourselves sat down at those tables, those negotiating tables, with the conviction in our minds that there must not be a war, then there will not be a war, and there could almost instantly be a reduction in those terrible and dangerous arms, those weapons. I am certain that the [NORP] people do not want a war, and I know our people do not . We do not . And I just do are they willing to come to the table with that idea in mind, instead of an idea as to how they can preserve some margin of superiority for themselves. [INTERVIEWER1] heard, [INTERVIEWED], has there been the slightest signal of the overall regret expressed by some segments of the [NORP] leadership, which there has been, small as it may be. Have you regarded that as any kind of genuine signal? [INTERVIEWED]. No, because I do not think it is come from the kind of people that normally would give the signals. But it is an indication there of, certainly, recognition on the part of some, as you say, that this was as terrible a deed as we have said it was. And I just think the world is owed an apology plus a statement to the effect that they are going to join the rest of us in cooperating to see that such a thing can never happen again. And that could be aided and abetted also if they would recognize some responsibility in compensation for the families of the victims. [INTERVIEWER1] [INTERVIEWED], do you think there may be some sort of a high-level political dispute going on in the [ORG], that the statements by these lower level officials, which were just referred to, may represent and in fact there is not unanimity in there on what happened? [INTERVIEWED]. I would not hazard a guess on that. But I do say that there is evidence that is a little different than what we usually expect, because usually the official reply comes out with unanimous support over there, and that is it, and that is the story everyone tells. So, this has been a little different, that there have been voices that have begun now. They were not heard for quite a while. In fact, there was such a difference in the stories that it just further added to the evidence of how deliberate and despicable this act was. Most people are tending to forget that their first statement was that they just did not know anything about it. It just disappeared from their radar. And then when the evidence was presented that it had been shot down and that they were responsible for that, suddenly they come up with a new story about spy plane and so forth. No one's mentioned this yet, but is not that a pretty hardthe idea of errora pretty hard thing to believe, when that plane is one on a regular schedule, that at least every week is flying that same route and at the same time of day? [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], are your plans firm [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. What is that? [INTERVIEWER1]. Are your plans firm for [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the trip is still planned. If there would be any reason to change it, it would be domestic, because there is a probability we had planned that trip with the idea that [ORG] would not be in session, that it would have gone home. And that is questionable now as to whether they are going to go home. And now it makes you wonder, how can you be in [CARDINAL] places at once? But do not take that as an indication. So far the trip is still on. [INTERVIEWER1]. The First Lady had expressed second thoughts, misgivings about that particular trip, given the recent events, the recent, tragic events. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me just say and I sympathize with her very deeply, but since a previous experience that we had , I should not use the expression she is a little gun shy. No, but she does feel a legitimate concern and in many places where I have to appear. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], just to come back to your speech to the [ORG] [DATE] and your [CARDINAL] proposals, I was struck let me not talk for everyone, because we have not all talked about it but it struck me as being rather generous towards the negotiating position, in the view that they have constantly said no, and you say, Well, all right, now, we will count the aircraft, and we will not count the missiles in the Far East. So that would reduce the total number to which we are responding in Western Europe. [INTERVIEWED]. Ah, but we reserve the right to place in other areas [INTERVIEWER1] Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. to counter what other threats might be involved in their disposition in other areas of their missiles. [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, and you go very far towards meeting the [NORP] position over the Pershings, which they have been making the most noise about. [INTERVIEWED]. Maybe that was a restatement of something that was always in our mind. The original concept of what was going in [ORG] in INF was going to be a mix of Pershings and cruise missiles. And at [CARDINAL] time, there was a [NORP] voice raised that, well, they might listen to cruise missiles but not Pershings at all. Well, this in a way [DATE] was a restatement that, no, there will still be a mix, but we are willing that if they agree to reductions, that means that our original figure must be reduced. That reduction will be in both Pershings and cruise missiles. But as I said in the remarks, I'd like to see it on the [CARDINAL] basis. We know that cannot be. Well, now we want any reduction that can be achieved is going to be better than what threatens us now and threatens our allies in Europe. And so, that is what we are going to continue to strive for, is to the lowest possible point that they will come, and we will meet them on an equal and a verifiable basis. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you have been at the [ORG] and there have been reports out of your administration that you and some of your senior aides feel that there is a double standard operating for example, being quick to condemn [GPE] for its invasion of [GPE] but not condemning the [NORP] downing of the airliner or the [NORP] invasion of [GPE]. Do you feel after being here that there is a double standard? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, I have noticed that many times they on many votes have been able to marshal a majority of votes their way and not on ours. What I was trying to point out was again the something happens to the whole concept of the [ORG] if we find the [ORG], like the world, beginning to divide up into blocs. The ideal was supposed to be that every nation would be there as an individual and seeking the same thing, the things that are called for in the charter of the [ORG] And there has been evidence of the other, of kind of taking sides or bloc voting, and I was just trying to call their attention back to the original purpose. I will tell you, may I say something else about that, too? It is time that all of us recognize that maybe we are not as civilized as we were when I was a young man growing up. By that I mean that it was taken for granted for [DATE] and [DATE], [DATE] prior to World War II, that all the rules of warfare were aimed at limiting warfare to warriors and providing protection and neutrality for civilians. And without quite realizing it is happened, we are in a world [DATE] where not only are the civilians fair game, but the most potent weapons systems, the nuclear weapons, are definitely aimed at the destruction of civilians. And would not it be nice if in a forum of this kind we could get back to being as civilized as we once were? [INTERVIEWER1]. Since we are in [GPE], could we ask you a question about the [NORP] vote? In [DATE] you scored a very high proportion of the [NORP] vote for a [NORP], but since then, it has been suggested that support has dwindled. Do you think it would be possible to recapture that element in your [DATE] strategy? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I never conceded that we lost them. I think we have more to offer them than the other side does. And, no, I have not felt that at all. I know that sometimes in all of this debate with regard to the peace plan and all, there were times when the [NORP] and ourselves found ourselves differing on various points. But that never in any way and they knew this as well; the [NORP] knew this that never slackened in any way or weakened the resolve of this country, which has existed since [DATE], of a moral obligation to see that [GPE] continues to exist as a nation. [INTERVIEWER1] Thank you, sir. [INTERVIEWER1]. Could I ask [CARDINAL] last question? [INTERVIEWED], I wonder if I could ask you as an astute political observer, not as a [INTERVIEWED], who you think amongst the [NORP] candidates for President might be the toughest candidate? [INTERVIEWED]. If I knew the answer to that one, I would not give it to you. Why should I help them make their decision?", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorps", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. I am delighted to take questions. I just had a long telephone conversation with [PERSON] -- very interesting. Maybe [PERSON] already told you about that. Mr. [PERSON]. I did mention that you'd made a call. [INTERVIEWED]. He called me, following his suggestions on the [NORP] question. And I feel comfortable; I think we are on track. I have been in close touch with our allies -- in fact, talked to every single one, as I said [DATE], in [ORG]. And I have talked to [PERSON] in [GPE], talked to others around that are not exactly tied into this, and I am feeling very well prepared. We have had a series of briefings at the Cabinet level and expert level, outside specialist level. And so, I have still got a little more reading to do and talking to our team that will be there, but it is taking proper shape. I'd be glad to take some questions. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you look at the events that have transpired in Eastern Europe and [GPE] -- the upheaval, if you will -- do you think the period of greatest danger for the West has now passed, or does it still lie ahead? [INTERVIEWED]. Of greatest danger? [INTERVIEWER]. Of greatest danger in coping with this. The risk of [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have not seen danger in coping with it up until now. Maybe I misunderstand your question. I mean, what we have done is to certainly rejoice in the rapid change, but I have not seen threats at this moment to reverse the change. In other words, I think [PERSON] has said that he is not going to intervene in this change. He is taken a very broad view of it. And so, we have not felt imminent danger in what has transpired so far, but what I think you want to do is to conduct yourself in a way that you do not inadvertently contribute to an atmosphere of danger or create a danger where one need not exist. And that would mean avoid some of the more flamboyant posturing that has been urged on me from time to time. That is not a way you conduct the foreign affairs of this country. And I will tell you what is reassuring on that, [PERSON], is the reaction again from our allies. They have been rather complimentary of the posture of [GPE], as they see it. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if [PERSON] -- as a result of strikes and famine, say, in [GPE] [DATE] -- felt the need to crack down sharply, would that be the end of perestroika? Would it be the end of the warmup in relations and a renewal of the cold war? [INTERVIEWED]. It would be dumb for me to respond to such a hypothetical question. I am not going to do that -- I am simply not, and I have taken that position steadily. I get asked that, and I simply am not going to take that position. Clearly, I think everybody would know that we would take a very dim view of military force to change the course of events, and yet I would compliment [PERSON] for not taking that action. So, for me to hypothecate that he is going to do that, or speculate on what happens -- I simply would respectfully ask not to be pursued on that because I am not going to answer. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I was told that during some of your sessions with experts one of the things you wanted to know from them was what they thought [PERSON]'s goals would be for the summit and, if they were you, what their goals would be. As a result of all your preparations, have you formalized concrete goals for yourself for the summit? And if you have, can you share those with us? [INTERVIEWED]. No, we have got some objectives, but the goals remain the same: an open agenda meeting where we discuss a wide array of issues. And I will raise some. I talked about one [DATE] that clearly everybody knows I'd raise -- let me just reassert it here -- the question of Central America and [NORP] -- -- Q. But, sir, your personal -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Put it this way, [PERSON]: There is been no change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to be about. Events have changed more rapidly since the genesis of the meeting than I thought, but there is no shift. And I have seen nothing authoritative from [GPE] to make me think they are looking at it differently. There may be more of an urgency to it -- I would say that. And I would say that if we had not suggested such a meeting at [DATE] that -- given the rapid changes that have taken place, particularly in Eastern Europe -- we probably would have gone ahead and suggested such a meeting within [DATE] or [CARDINAL]. But it has not changed -- a lot of speculation, but it has not changed. Q. Have you found a way through your people to send the word to Mr. [PERSON] that you would not appreciate any bombshell surprises? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have sent the message that we do not think there are going to be any, but if he comes with something, fine. I mean, this is an open thing. He can say anything he wants, but I think he wants to see a successful meeting. And I do not think we want to go -- any side, either side -- no indication that anyone wants to go out of the meeting having a contentious feeling. Certainly we do not , and I have had no evidence from any of the contacts that have been made with [GPE] that they are looking for confrontation. And so, I think that it is unlikely there will be something so dramatic that it puts us in an embarrassing position. There is not going to be that -- it does not matter. We are part of an alliance, and we are not going to go unilaterally making commitments that affect our allies. And I obviously will feel free to tell Mr. [PERSON] that, but I also have a feeling that he is so well plugged in that I do not need to say that. He will know it. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], could I ask a post-summit question? You talked about the aspirations over [DATE], and at the risk of talking about the vision thing, could you describe somewhat specifically what kind of things do you see, maybe, say in [DATE] with a downsized military? What kind of adjustments will the country have to make, assuming that things go on track as they are now? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think I can definitively answer that until we know what course the arms control agreements take. And we will know much more about that by the time of the summit meeting which will be held [DATE]. In terms of the vision thing, the aspirations, I spelled it out in little-noted speeches [DATE] and summer, which I would like everyone to go back and re-read. And I will have a quiz on it because they are rather autographed copies and [INTERVIEWER]. Governor [PERSON] has given us our copies. [INTERVIEWED]. Has he? But you will see in there some of the vision thing -- a Europe whole and free. Now, that, I think, takes on a little more relevance [DATE], given the changes that have already taken place or that are taking place. [DATE] it is [DATE], and I do not know what the changes are going to be on [DATE], but it is been more rapid than we saw. I think it is been more rapid than Mr. [PERSON] saw or more rapid than our allies saw. But in terms of your question, I think a Europe whole and free is less vision than perhaps reality. But how we get there and what that means and when the [NORP] question is resolved and all of these things -- I cannot answer more definitively. I cannot answer. [INTERVIEWER]. Are there dangers, let us say, in the peace dividend ? Are there dangers of dislocation in [NORP] industry? [INTERVIEWED]. Talking about a peace dividend I agree with that, I will go back and answer your question. But when you mention peace dividend, there is almost a -- well, there is an uncalled-for euphoria in some quarters now that suggests that events where they stand [DATE] means that [GPE] can recklessly in my view recklessly cut its defense spending. And we are not in that posture. We have commitments to an alliance, and that is not to say that we are going to always have to have exactly the same deployment of forces every place around the world. But we are rethinking all of this, but you cannot make a judgment until you get some feeling as to what your allies think and some feeling as to what [PERSON] and the [ORG] countries think. I interrupted the question because I wanted to say that when I hear now peace dividend, what that implies to me -- somebody said, well, if you cut defense spending by [MONEY], we can take that money and spend it on something else. They all have a wide array of programs. We cannot do that. We have got enormous budget problems facing me. I feel very strongly about it because [PERSON] [[PERSON], Director of [ORG]] just walked out and when you see him walking out, I go through a period of [TIME] of gloom before I refocus on what else is happening out there. And now I am back talking about [GPE]. But seriously, the budget problems that we face -- and all the budgeteers know it -- in [DATE] are enormous, so it is premature to talk about a peace dividend in the sense of take volumes of money out of defense and apply it to some worthy cause. We cannot do that. Does that answer your question? [INTERVIEWER]. It was kind of a peace dividend was only in the sense that I was interested in what kinds of dislocations in [NORP] society do you see? I mean, if you are cutting back, let us say again, this is on the premise that things go on track as they are now but assuming that you do have an arms control agreement of some fashion [INTERVIEWED]. That permits [INTERVIEWER]. that permits downsizing armies, how do you kind of approach unemployment in the military? How do you approach the defense industry? [INTERVIEWED]. That gets back to the fiscal side of the equation have fiscal policies that are so sound that [GPE] continues to grow. We have created [CARDINAL] you know the litany [CARDINAL] new jobs in [DATE], or whatever. But be sure that that economy grows to accommodate people. This is one of the big problems back to the [NORP] equation because as they pull back and demobilize, the impact on their economy is very, very difficult right now. They have, I am told, real concerns about dislocation: How do you treat the people coming out of the services? You have got housing problems that make ours pale in comparison. Now, I do not mean to be mingling into the internal affairs of [GPE], but I have gotten enough information to know that this is very difficult for people. I think it would be less difficult here if we have a strong economy, much less difficult. We do, right now pretty good. The growth is not as robust as I'd like to see it now, but we are still moving, still growing, still creating jobs. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a moment ago, you said that neither you nor Mr. [PERSON] is looking for a confrontation at [GPE]. And yet, from [DATE], we learned that you planned very early in your talks to tell Mr. [PERSON] your concerns through [PERSON] [President of [GPE]] of the introductions of weapons through [GPE]. If you do that, is not that apt to, [CARDINAL], create some tension in those talks and, [CARDINAL], perhaps cast a pale over the improving relations with the [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I do not want to surprise him, and I would surprise him if I do not raise that subject. No surprises. And he knows how strongly we feel about it -- that was discussed at the [[NORP] Foreign Minister] [PERSON] meeting. I believe that it is been represented to [GPE] by [GPE] that they are not sending arms into the [ORG]. And I will be prepared to discuss with keen definition exactly what our complaints are against the [NORP] support for [ORG], and I will accurately replay to him what [PERSON] asked me to replay to him -- his concerns about [GPE]'s role in all of this. So, it would be a surprise to him if I did not raise it. I do not think it has to be contentious because they have already made certain representations to us about not supporting the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER]. And on [GPE], it is been [INTERVIEWED]. What I'd like to do, see, what I'd love to do, is see them swing further over. They are talking about choice and free elections and all these things -- I mean, let us apply that to this hemisphere. I do not think it has to be raised in a way that is going to blow something up, [PERSON]. I think they expect to talk about it, and we expect to talk about it. [INTERVIEWER]. On [GPE], it is , I believe, been [DATE] since we sent some experts down there. Are you assured in your own mind that forensic tests are going to show that there is absolutely no government involvement in the slaughter of the [NORP], and convinced that the [PERSON] government is playing on a level field with us? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I believe [PERSON] when he says he wants to get to the bottom of it. He is asked for some technical help, he is gotten some, and it is absolutely essential that we keep insisting that the [PERSON] government get to the bottom of those killings. And having said that, I would like to express, lest the question not arise, my concern about the wanton attack by these [ORG] guerrillas on the residences of [NORP] serving in official capacity there in [GPE]. That is unacceptable to us. And what I can do about it, I do not know. So, get to the bottom of those who killed the priests, absolutely, and they owe us and the rest of the world an explanation on that. The killers must be brought to justice. Secondly, the [ORG] ought to stop shooting up civilian population and trying to undermine an elected government that is been through certifiably free elections. And I am outraged by the attacks on the lives of [NORP] -- holding [NORP] in hotels, attacking [NORP]' residences. And so, I have outrage on both accounts. [INTERVIEWER]. If I could go back to Europe for a second, [INTERVIEWED]. It is clear that the changes of [DATE] somehow are going to alter the definition of what [ORG] and [ORG] are all about. Do you have some ideas or some thoughts about the longrun future of the alliances and how they ought to change to meet these new circumstances that you want to get across to Mr. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. One of the things that is responsive in that area is, we began talking at the last meetings of [ORG]'s role and concern on economic problems and on other global problems. That is not to say that suddenly the mission changes [DATE] from an alliance with strong military component to some economic structure. But I think as threats change, roles change, definitions change. And so again, it is too early to predict how all this will play out, but clearly it is moving in the right direction, and clearly it is moving in a way that should result in a permanent reduction of the tensions that have been the hallmark of [DATE]. So, I think there is dramatic progress. But I am sorry, but I still think there is reason to be prudent and cautious. Some others may label it differently, but those are the words I elect. And I have a funny feeling I feel more strongly about that, [PERSON], [DATE] than I did even [DATE] before I started talking to our [ORG] friends and allies. [INTERVIEWER]. I was just going to ask quickly about [GPE] because that is where the latest changes have taken place. In your view, has enough happened there to begin the kind of integration and Western aid process that you have had in [GPE] and [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Not yet. I think you have to see more development. It is obviously exciting. I will try to be exhilarated here as I this so cameras are not here, but I want you to report [INTERVIEWER]. You look exhilarated. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] told me [DATE], Lean forward -- show that you are interested in all of this. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. Put on your glasses. [INTERVIEWED]. Do something. Do not just sit there. I have taken the hits on being [INTERVIEWER]. So has [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, he sits on your side, somebody's side, the camera's side. But where were we before I got off -- -- [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Events are still a little behind where they are on some of these others, but they are moving so fast. And I certainly like what I am hearing, but I think -- in answer to your question -- the election process is, I'd say, inevitable, coming along. I mean, they are moving. You take a look at someplace like [GPE] -- I mean, my God, I'd like to see some action there. My heavens -- correct that -- I would like to see some action there. I'd like to see them come into the new world and not deprive their people of a chance to be independent and free. I mean, I do not know when that is going to come. We have sent a new Ambassador over there who is a friend of mine, and I sent him there because he is strong and tough and he knows of my conviction about democracy and freedom. I think [PERSON] left [DATE], and if anybody can represent our viewpoint -- mine, [INTERVIEWED]'s -- on this matter to Mr. [PERSON], I believe it is this man. So, we will be trying, but it is so difficult there. [GPE] is ahead of that now. Moved faster than we think, but not as far along as certainly as [GPE]. Maybe in an economic sense, they are better, [PERSON]. They may have problems -- in fact, they do -- but I would say that they have got less scale, their problems are less intense on the economics front than [GPE]'s. I mean, in my bet. Everyone thinks they have got -- -- [INTERVIEWER]. Get through [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. these horrible problems. So, there we are. But, no -- and all of this, I think, will be discussed. And it is not like I am going with suggestions to do this about [GPE] and that about [GPE]. I want to know what Mr. [PERSON] thinks about this, how he sees it as affecting [GPE] itself. I am one that is been around the track enough to know that there is no fine lines between intervening in the internal affairs of a country and having a frank discussion about the problems facing that country. And I hope Mr. [PERSON] knows that I know the difference, but I want it to be as free and full of discussion as possible. And I am more concerned about his economic problems, not in some put-down sense or not in trying to be -- hey, we have got a good economy and you do not -- I mean, a [CARDINAL]-upsman sense. But how do we interact? What kind of reforms can [GPE] do so we can do more in terms of investment? [PERSON] said [DATE] -- somebody asked him about -- I think the question was rather rudely put, I think -- said something about, do you want [GPE] to bail you out? And he reacted as he should have reacted, with a certain sovereign pride, and said, Wait [TIME]. That is not what this is all about. So, we are not going there with an arrogance. I am going in the spirit of inquiry and findings ways that we can help and be sure that everything moves forward so this change that the West has been advocating, and clearly [GPE] has -- change towards freedom and democracy and the people governing themselves -- I mean, it is all moving in the right direction, and we want to keep it going. And [PERSON] has played a very, very constructive role as these events have developed in Eastern Europe. [INTERVIEWER]. I just wonder, [INTERVIEWED], if there is any chance that or what your thinking is now on the possibilities of a CFE treaty [DATE] and START treaty [DATE]? Do you think [INTERVIEWED]. I think we have got to push for them, and I will be obviously bringing those subjects up. I mean, the concept of our wanting to go ahead and conclude agreements there -- and throw in chemical -- I still am very much interested, and I think they are. I have gotten back from them a real interest in moving chemical forward. And it is not just our fault or theirs. We have got other parties that are very much interested in what we do, obviously, in chemical and CFE -- I mean, these are multilateral. And some of the problems on the CFE are alliance problems -- not just shifting the blame to [GPE]. So, we can talk about those things, and maybe we will get some ideas as to how to move them along. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you expect to sign something [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I hope so. I think that should be our goal, absolutely. World War II Peace Treaty [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you think there needs to be a peace treaty formally ending World War II? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], eventually, but these matters can all be discussed. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think there should be some sort of conference to work it out or something like that? [INTERVIEWED]. We are having a conference at [GPE] to talk about not that subject per se but to talk about a wide array of subjects that will have an eventual bearing on this. I am not one who believes that the status quo in [GPE], for example, or in the [GPE] or in Western Europe, wherever else, has to always be that way. Status quo forever? No. [INTERVIEWER]. You realize, of course, that [PERSON] is going to be in a state of grace, having just returned from the [FAC]. [Laughter] He may take advantage of that. [PERSON] knows what the state of grace is all about. [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. Look, [PERSON], I want to tell you something. We are trying to separate church and state here. [INTERVIEWER]. This is my first time wearing glasses. That is why I came -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. You have got good ones -- no bifocals. [INTERVIEWER]. It is a sure sign of age. [INTERVIEWED]. What do you need them for? For close in? [INTERVIEWER]. No, distance, I think. [INTERVIEWED]. You do not need them for reading? [INTERVIEWER]. Not yet. [INTERVIEWED]. Wait until you get a little mileage on that old body. [INTERVIEWER]. That is soon enough. [INTERVIEWED]. Are you going? Are you guys all going? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. Where do you stay? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, that is what they tell us. [INTERVIEWED]. I thought the island was [QUANTITY] long, from end to end. [INTERVIEWER]. We are at the other end. [INTERVIEWED]. Do you want to borrow my boat on [GPE] so you can -- -- [INTERVIEWER]. It does not sound like you are going to see much of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. No. The Prime Minister [[PERSON]] sent me a beautiful book on [GPE]. It has marvelous pictures. Q. How did you happen to think of it? Just because it is so close to [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Close, logistically close, and we'd had good reports from our little mission that my brother was on that went over there. I have met the Prime Minister. They are a small country respected by both parties. Certainly, I have a favorable feeling about what they have tried to do, and it seemed like it lends itself very nicely to this concept of a meeting aboard ships. We have some nice anchorage there. Nobody is going to be throwing up. [INTERVIEWER]. Always a good point. [INTERVIEWED]. We are thinking of the journalistic profession. [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON] -- did not he call it a tiny island of history and romance? Which is -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Who said that? [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWER]. No, [PERSON] said it about [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Is that right? [INTERVIEWER]. I think; I will have to check the references, but that was it. Governor [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED] is very partial to falcons. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. There is a sign -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I said to somebody, Is there any fishing over there? I thought I'd get a chance. And they said, The best fishing in [GPE] is in the harbor where you are. I said, You have got to be kidding. These ships, these great big ships? He said, Absolutely. This is where people go. So, I have got to figure out -- I do not want to look frivolous. [INTERVIEWER]. The portholes. [INTERVIEWER]. [ORG] will catch you. [INTERVIEWED]. [ORG], are they still picking at you guys for coming in here? [INTERVIEWER]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. But that is good. [INTERVIEWER]. This must be the first time you will be sleeping on a ship in a while. Since [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No -- well, it could not be since [DATE] -- it may, it may be. [PERSON] and I went on a cruise and -- no, I have slept on a boat going down, with my son, down the Potomac River, taking my speedboat around to the Eastern Shore. Mrs. [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. And your wife is not going on this trip? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. But Mrs. [PERSON] apparently is going. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I do not know what the role will be. But [PERSON] has the Kennedy Center Honors, which is something that they -- and it is a shipboard meeting, and it did not seem to lend itself quite as much to the events, things of interest to her, literacy and all that, as other -- where she and Mrs. [PERSON] might constructively interact on their interests. So, it did not work out. [INTERVIEWER]. But Mrs. [PERSON] is okay? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, she is fine, thank you. No, she is. She got a good review [DATE]. And she is still got it, she is still -- this Grave's disease. But I said to the doctor, I said, Is there any secret agenda on this? I mean, it just lags on? He said, Absolutely not. And they have got now [ORG] and [ORG] and [FAC], and it is just a question of getting the proper balance with the drug or radiation or time. So, thank you for asking, but she", "discourse_type": 1}

They told me that [CARDINAL] of the girl on my right that pretty looking she claims to be the 250th in the world in tennis. And she is struggling and trying to it is so wonderful practices [TIME] [DATE]. And she is a pretty [INTERVIEWER1]. on red clay? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, on that -- on red clay over there, yes. And then the kids they train for what they call their national games or something there. The one that spoke the English, her dad was a coach in [GPE]. And she learned her English over there, and she is a high-jumper. But anyway, it was fun. [INTERVIEWER1]. a good mood? [INTERVIEWED]. Good mood. This visit to [GPE] well, [GPE] also but both of them were very, very moving. And I just come away with this real acute sense now of the change that is taking place in Eastern Europe and a determination to play a constructive role in that change. The meetings with these [NORP] leaders the most recent visit were very good, very frank. I have been to, what, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] countries, or something, as Vice President; and these talks were more than just diplomatic. I mean, you did not rely on the printed card, and they did not . I mean, they spoke right from the heart. They said what they thought; they made clear the difficulties that they were facing. And I tried to do the same thing. There was something very special and warm and personal about the meetings in both [GPE] and [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think you made a difference? [INTERVIEWER1]. I realize it would not have been diplomatic for any of those leaders to say so, but did you hear any complaints in either place about the sufficiency of the packages you brought? [INTERVIEWED]. No, and I think you are right: There may be a reason that they would not say so. But I heard none at all, not [CARDINAL]. And in fact, [PERSON] [[ORG] leader], who had been reported to be asking for [MONEY], moved off of that and said that what they wanted were more banks to come in that would loan those kinds of money. There was a paper written by a [NORP] economist that had the figure of [MONEY] and had broken it down into x-number of dollars from [ORG], x from the [ORG], x -- and it added up to [MONEY]. But there was no pressure of that nature, and then I see that subseQuently [PERSON] was in the paper [DATE] or [DATE] saying that there had not been a disappointment. But I think they understand that we are restricted in what we can do in terms of aid, or dollars of support, for some very worthy project. The thing that is impressive is the determination on the part of all these leaders to move towards economic freedom and political freedom. It was so clear in [GPE]. General [PERSON] [Chairman of [ORG]] -- who has had an image in the [GPE] earlier on that was not a very favorable one -- is really out front in the reforms. And conversations were very warm and very frank with him. We'd talk about differences, but we'd also talk about common objectives. And he went out of his way to be hospitable. And then the same thing on the -- what you'd call the private sector side -- [PERSON] down there. And the same was true here; we met with the leaders and then, again, the opposition. And then they were all together at a reception. It is -- change is absolutely amazing that is taking place in Eastern Europe. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think that you have made a difference? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I do. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think that was? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the very fact that they can sit and talk to an [NORP] President in a reasonable way and I could tell them what I thought we would be able to do, how much we shared their desire for change -- I think was fruitful to them. And I think they saw the friendship and respect for [GPE] from their people -- the crowds on the street and the -- any time there was interaction with the people it was dramatic. And I am sure that makes a difference to the leaders. I think it shores up their desire for change because I think it shows all of us the genuine affection for [GPE] that exists in these countries and, I would say, in the rest of Eastern Europe, too, although I cannot speak as authoritatively. I have been t [INTERVIEWER1]. Is [GPE] going to get a government soon? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know, [PERSON], I do not know. I would say yes, but I cannot predict who [INTERVIEWED]'s going to be. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did [PERSON] seem concerned? [INTERVIEWED]. We discussed that very openly, but it is just something I cannot predict the outcome. [INTERVIEWER1]. holding them up? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it takes some time after their elections for the [ORG], and I think that they are now trying to sort out, in an arrangement, who to support for President. And you have got several different options. But that is their business; that is the internal affair of [GPE], and I ought not to try to get involved in that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did [PERSON] express any concerns about calling upon workers to make the kind of sacrifices re[INTERVIEWER1]uired? Because that is another problem area. [INTERVIEWED]. He did not express concern about that, but I had an opportunity to make clear in private that and publicly that reforms were essential. There is no point going there under false colors and to try to have everything sweetness and light as a message that but it is not going to be easy. But that is part of the message. The rest of it is that change is in the winds, and I sense it so much more clearly from having been there. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you feel the general I mean, you could see a man almost totally resigned [INTERVIEWED]. Did I feel what? [INTERVIEWER1]. Do not you feel that the general sees something besides the inevitable? I mean, he seems to have given up. [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think it is a question of resignation. You see, as you see change take place in [GPE], this opens the way for change vital change, vibrant change in the rest of Eastern Europe. And so, I did not sense a dejection on his part; I sensed somewhat of an upbeat feeling that, yes, that these changes were possible now. And I certainly sense that in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. odd man out? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let us wait and see. [NORP] Reforms [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think your opinions may have encouraged reform in some of the other countries, such as, maybe, [GPE] or [GPE] or [GPE], or might there be a backlash [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you want to be careful not to conduct yourself in such a way as to encourage a backlash. But I would think that this visit in the neighborhood would be watched by countries where economic and political change are lagging behind [GPE] and lagging behind [GPE]. That is not true of [GPE], and it is not true of [GPE]. But there are other countries that are probably watching and wondering. I am firmly convinced that this wave of freedom, if you will, is the wave of the future. And I would expect that this visit has been watched by the people of other [NORP] countries and, hopefully, giving encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform political change, economic change -- that these other countries are now following. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think they will feel that talk is cheap from [GPE], and what about a little more aid to encourage their reform movement? [INTERVIEWED]. I did not sense that. That was their early question, and I did not sense it. I expect everybody would like to have as much aid as everybody possibly can attract. But when you are tying your position into economic reform and incentive and ownership and private sector and entrepreneurship, it seems to have at least negated the public cry or diminished the public cry for more funds. I just did not encounter that. In fact, a couple of them and I will leave their names out of it -- said: We did not expect you to come here with a bag full of money was the way they put it. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to tell the summit leaders that communism is dead? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I am going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking place in Eastern Europe, and I expect each one of them will want to tell me about their experiences with that. But I want to be sure that they know of our commitment to foster this change in a prudent way. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. I have not set up any yardsticks for that, [PERSON][PERSON], [ORG]]. I do not think that there is a way to measure success at an economic summit. I mean, this is not a summit where there is [CARDINAL] major problem to be solved. There are problems on the agenda, but I expect at the conclusion of the meeting you will see [CARDINAL] countries in harmony, pulling together on matters like the environment and, you know, the economies of the various countries, and trade. All these are contentious matters bilaterally, but I think we can reach common understanding. So, maybe that would be the yardstick. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] to what is going on in Eastern Europe approach seems to be development in Eastern Europe and that you are a partner, but a limited partner. Is not it [PERSON]'s revolutionary approach to the East-West relationship that has given these people license to move forward? Is not he glad they are moving forward? [INTERVIEWED]. I would think so, and maybe you missed what I said about [GPE] and giving them the flexibility to move forward. So, no, I would certainly say, and I mentioned [CARDINAL] countries [CARDINAL] of them was [GPE]. I do not think you were here when I started talking about that. So, we are very pleased to see the perestroika. And let me repeat for the umpteenth time: I want to see it succeed. [INTERVIEWER1]. When are you going to tell him that personally? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know. [INTERVIEWER1]. [DATE]? [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No plans for that right now. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it would be useful? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think there is any misunderstanding on his part about the position of [GPE] in terms of his reforms. I think maybe if there is ever any doubt about it those doubts have been dispelled; and if there was any recent doubts about it, those doubts will be dispelled by his friends in [GPE] and in [GPE] because I made very clear to them that, you know, we are not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. [PERSON]. Just the opposite to encourage the very kind of reforms that he is championing and more reforms. [INTERVIEWER1]. convinced that he understands what you are doing? [INTERVIEWED]. Because there are so many contacts with him and because some of these leaders told me that. And they told me that in terms of our approach to arms also. There has been some suggestion we were dragging our feet on arms control, which is pure nonsense. And I am convinced from talking to these people that [PERSON] knows that we are serious. Indeed, we have an opportunity now to encourage him to move along faster on conventional force reductions. The idea that some [NORP] spokesman [DATE] says they cannot meet these timetables I do not want to believe that that is Mr. [PERSON] speaking. And I am not going to believe it until I hear from him or until I hear authoritatively that that is who it is. [INTERVIEWER1]. Should we not believe [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. You can believe [PERSON], yes, because he speaks with great authority. But this guy was not a -- I do not think it was a press spokesman. It was a [INTERVIEWER1]. It was a lieutenant general that [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, a lieutenant general. [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- political general. General [PERSON]. He is their arms control guy. [INTERVIEWED]. He is a couple of beats behind the pace here, because I do not think [PERSON] wants to slow down an agreement on conventional arms. If he does, he is wrong on that. But I do not believe he does. I think he wants to move forward there and on the strategic arms talks, and so do we. [INTERVIEWER1]. From your conversation, did you get any sense of what the bottom line is in Eastern Europe as far as political change? I mean, what are the [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] points that you cannot cross? [INTERVIEWED]. No, there does not seem to be a bottom line, because when you go to open, free, fair elections, who knows what is going to happen? Take a look at [GPE] I mean at [GPE]. Take a look at those [NORP] elections. So, the change is so rapid and so devastating to old ways that I do not think you can put a bottom line on the thing. [INTERVIEWER1]. Perhaps [PERSON] is also looking at the elections? [INTERVIEWED]. Probably looking at the elections at home, and that is a good thing. I tell you, the excitement of all this, you just feel it in talking to the leaders and feel it from the people. [INTERVIEWER1]. specific with both leaders that further economic reform for example, did you discuss with them the sale of state-owned business or getting private enterprise to the people in both [GPE] and [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, both, but in varying degrees of detail. Of course, [PERSON] that was his whole thrust: privatization. And the talks with Mr. [PERSON] we got into that. Mainly we were talking about joint ventures and partnerships, but also I had the opportunity to emphasize our conviction that state ownership is less productive than private ownership. And similarly, in a couple of the meetings maybe we did in all but in a couple of the meetings [DATE] there was discussion of privatization. No resistance, incidentally, it seemed like, in [GPE]. But we had a very frank discussion about what percentage of their gross national product was in government and what in private sector, and [GPE] still has a long way to go until it achieves privatization. [INTERVIEWER1]. any [NORP] or are they all, essentially they are all democratic, pluralistic [INTERVIEWED]. I met people that are caught up in this wave of historic change. [INTERVIEWER1]. What about [INTERVIEWER1]. Are they changing their whole philosophy? They are [NORP], are not they? [INTERVIEWED]. You asked whether one of the leaders made a big distinction between a [NORP] and a [NORP]. And [CARDINAL] of them pointed out that [NORP] socialism could well be the model of the future as opposed to the socialism that we equate with communism. [INTERVIEWER1]. What about the austerity side of this? Did you get into [DATE], the [NORP] would not get the votes they needed, and then you talk about belt-tightening. But did they talk to you about what they would do? And do you have any qualms that this might backfire that if these supports are removed, the [NORP] may not get the candy they need to keep supporting the system? [INTERVIEWED]. I had some feeling after some of the talks that the reforms that would be required would be very difficult for them. That is not universal, but it did come up. [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- in any way communicate that to [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, except indirectly saying please tell Mr. [PERSON] this, that, or the other. [INTERVIEWER1]. Would you have any plans to contact him [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have regularized contacts with [GPE] now, and we will continue on those. But there could be occasion to do that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did [PERSON] tell you about the powder-keg situation in [GPE], as he told TV interviewers? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I said, some of the interlocutors made clear that the kinds of reforms that are going to have to be taken will not be easy. It was not put in the context of powder keg. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we spelled out some broad parameters: privatization, openness, free elections. And that is just the [NORP] way, that is just our belief as to what works. And to the degree those things take place, why, we will be able to do more. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON]? Yes. I'd met him before, and it is funny how you just meet [CARDINAL] time and it establishes a certain personal warmth there. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you talked about the changes, and you used the word amazing. Were you surprised by the things you saw? [INTERVIEWED]. Not textbook surprised, but surprised at the feeling: the feeling and the emotion of it all and the frankness with which the leaders -- in [GPE] particularly; well, and also [PERSON] and [PERSON] -- talked about the change. I mean it was with emotion, and it was not your traditional I will read my cards, and you read your cards kind of diplomacy. It was very special in that regard. There is an intensity to it, a fervor to it that moved me very much. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. You mean like in Eastern Europe? Well, I think without the change in [GPE] it would have been highly unlikely that Eastern Europe would be achieving the kinds of changes or aspiring to the kinds of changes that it is aspiring to. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, I do not know. I do not ever look for disputes, I look for calming the troubled waters. You know that. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know that either. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I want to go to Africa, but there is no doubt -- I would not say that would be the next, would you? [NORP] Reforms [INTERVIEWER1]. keep this policy alive? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think it is the [GPE] role to keep the change alive. I mean, I think this is something that is the business of the [NORP] and of the [NORP]. This is their business; this is their life, their country. I think it would be rather arrogant to suggest that it is [GPE] that has the sole responsibility. That is not your question. But it, to the degree we can encourage change without intervention in the internal affairs -- why, I am all for that. But that is not our role. This is too fundamental: The people's aspiration for liberty and for free choice is too fundamental. And they can look to our system, look to our country, as a beacon for all these good values. But it is not our role to go in and dictate to any of these countries how they are going to run their business. [INTERVIEWER1]. tore up that [INTERVIEWED]. I know that struck you the most about it, because you did not have to stand out in the rain. [INTERVIEWER1]. He said they liked that. [INTERVIEWED]. Did they really? Well, I mean, I had plenty of opportunity to pay my formal respects, which, in essence, was what that was about. And those people had been standing there a long time. I told them [DATE] one of the leaders was very complimentary of that. And I said it reminds me of an old adage that [GPE] the speech that you do not that was the one in the rain. [INTERVIEWER1]. Who are you going to send to [GPE] as an emissary? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, there is not any emissary going from [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. There is no determination of that at this point. [INTERVIEWER1]. a chance to talk at [FAC]. Have you had any contact at all with the [NORP] on that question? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we chose to stop there because [FAC] is a great international symbol of human rights. And I do not know -- what do you mean about contact about -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, it is a constant issue that [GPE] officials are regularly asking of the [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. I have not personally asked of the [NORP] that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that the Secretary of [ORG] might send an emissary? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am saying that we have people go to [GPE] all the time and to other countries in the area. But when you say, Who am I sending as an emissary? -- I was putting that in the context of past high-level shuttle diplomats or something of that nature, and there are no plans for that. I reserve the right to send people anytime I think it is in the interest of [GPE], but there are no plans for that kind of level -- diplomacy. [INTERVIEWER1]. Why is the [GPE] making [INTERVIEWED]. But if somebody felt it was worthwhile, somebody over there would welcome a special emissary from [INTERVIEWED], I'd be very openminded about that. But there are no plans. You asked me whether there are plans. [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- find out what is going in terms of -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. We have got a very able Ambassador over there who knows a great deal about what is going on and has excellent contacts with the Government. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think is going on over there? [PERSON] has simply restated what his position has been all along. Why is the [GPE] so shook up over this? The President. I do not know that the [GPE] is so shook up, but they know the [GPE] policy. And the [GPE] policy on settlements, for example, has not changed, and it is not going to change. And so, we might as well be frank with our friends, because that is what friendship is about. And so, I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there, and we want to see the election process go forward. And if anybody can make a case for me that the recent deliberations in that party will enhance the election process, then I'd say, Great! But I am afraid other people are looking at it, saying, What is happened does not enhance the possibilities of election. So, the [GPE] policy is set. And I am [INTERVIEWED]of [GPE], and [GPE] is a friend and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is -- and so, I do not think there is great heartburn here, but I want to just continue to articulate what we believe. [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- [PERSON] said -- what should be important from the very start -- so I am trying to figure out why [GPE] is so distressed. [INTERVIEWED]. I am not so distressed. I am [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWER1]. I mean [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you go ahead and talk to [ORG] about that. You are talking to the President. I set the policy, after a lot of input from [ORG], and I want the [GPE] policy to succeed. We have thought out very carefully what we think is best, and our support is for our principles. And they have got great difficulties inside of [GPE]. I understand that. I understand the political pressures. But I cannot be varying [GPE] policy [DATE] to accommodate political change. I am not going to do that. [INTERVIEWER1]. How about the [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. Keep encouraging them to do what they ought to do: to participate in this election process -- absolutely -- and deplore the kind of violence that we see when a bus is carried over a cliff and carrying a lot of innocent people to their death, or innocent people getting killed in other ways -- on both sides. I mean we have to stand for something. And I am going to continue to try to do that. [INTERVIEWER1]. When did you first decide you were President? When did it hit you? Mr. [PERSON]. That sounds like an essay question to me. [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know. But I am deciding more and more that I am. Experience never hurt anybody, did it? Experience does not hurt.

[INTERVIEWED], what are you going to do about the fact that sensitive and relevant documents were not reviewed by the Iran-contra committees? [INTERVIEWED]. In the first place, I have great confidence that [PERSON] [Counsel to President [PERSON]] and those charged with cooperating with [ORG] were cooperative; I have seen nothing to indicate they were not . Secondly, I would offer full cooperation to any request made of this administration, and I just cannot confirm the hypothesis of your question at all. [INTERVIEWER1]. But you mean you would turn over any documents that they now want to see? Is that what you are saying by full cooperation ? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, procedures were set up to determine what documents would be made available. Those procedures were agreed to by the [ORG]. Certainly, I would see that if any documents are in control of this administration -- relevant documents -- that we would live assiduously by those guidelines. But I have no reason to believe that the previous administration, the lawyers in it who worked closely with [ORG], did not fulfill their obligations. [INTERVIEWER1].

[INTERVIEWED]. I have told you that I am not going to discuss that until the trial with [PERSON] is over. [INTERVIEWER1]. But the jury is being sequestered [DATE], sir, and it is -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. No, I might have something to say on it when the trial is over, but I would simply ask you to understand that this is a request of the lawyers. And I am not going to do something that inadvertently will -- but put it this way: My conscience is clear. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, there have been suggestions that -- on the documents -- that there might have been an oversight, either on the part of the [ORG], the part of the [ORG] staff. As far as you can tell, was there an oversight by any of those [CARDINAL] bodies, or was it a question of -- the [ORG] was not pushing the right buttons to get the documents? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am not sure. I do not know. All I can just state is the confidence that I feel in [GPE] and company. But we have received the letter down here, and I will take this opportunity to tell them we will cooperate fully. But who controls the documents and all of that -- you will have to talk to the lawyers about that. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], when you say -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I think they are in the control and in the custody of the [ORG] archivists, but I am not sure. [INTERVIEWER1]. When you say you will cooperate fully with -- I presume you mean Senators [PERSON] and [PERSON] [member and chairman of [ORG] and the [NORP] Opposition, respectively]. In their letter -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Everybody. [INTERVIEWER1]. Does that mean -- they have asked you, I think, to launch an investigation to find out exactly what happened. Are you saying you will launch an investigation or that you have? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not remember launching an investigation. Was that part of their request? [INTERVIEWER1]. I think the language is an immediate and thorough investigation which essentially asks whether and why documents were not provided. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would refer them to the people that were in charge of the documentation, which would be Mr. [PERSON] and company, in whom I have great confidence. But if there is anything we can do to encourage that -- absolutely. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], when you say your conscience is clear, do you mean that the interpretation that has been made of the documents in this trial, which I gather were made by Mr. [PERSON] himself, are not entirely accurate? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not discussing anything about my role in this except to say that everything I have said I will stand behind. [INTERVIEWER1]. You will not even -- since they are sequestered -- just give us a -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I have just told the gentleman that I am not going to go into that. So, please, do not ask me to do that which I have just said I am not going to do, because you are burning up time. The meter is running. Throw the sand on you -- -- Semiautomatic Weapons [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. Assault weapons. [INTERVIEWED]. And I am now filibustering, so -- [laughter]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, can I ask you about assault weapons? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, no, you have already used up your time. [INTERVIEWER1]. No, no, no. Assault weapons. You know, [PERSON], your drug czar, has made a proposal that you treat them like machineguns, which would mean people would register and they'd have their names on file and so forth. First off, what do you think of that idea? And secondly, when are you going to tell us your next step on that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we are having a meeting [TIME] with certain Members of [ORG] on this. The standards that are set up in existing law about import are: suitability for sporting purposes. And we are being very careful here, but we are going to make a determination using that as a standard. And, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], I cannot say exactly when it will be, but I have expressed my concern about these weapons and their suitability. So, stay tuned. I do not know exactly when it will be, but there is a meeting here [DATE] that is just ongoing, and I have great confidence in [PERSON]. We have talked to a wide array of people on this. We have gone to some of the think tanks -- that very intelligent, thoughtful paper from [PERSON] [president, [ORG]] group over at [ORG], very thoughtful. And so, our package will be -- I guarantee it will include more on law enforcement. And I am sure that [PERSON] will be totally on board. But we have not gotten the final administration position yet. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], will you apply the same standard to domestically made weapons that you apply to imported weapons? [INTERVIEWED]. We are in the process of discussing that now and what role the administration has -- whether it is strictly restriction of imports or something broader than that. [INTERVIEWER1]. At this point, are you convinced that any package that deals with drug violence and crime must also include some aspect that deals with assault weapons? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, I cannot say that. I cannot go that far, because we really have not gotten that far in determining it. President's Popularity [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], the [ORG]-New York Times poll [TIME] puts your approval rating at [PERCENT] but suggests there is more style than substance. What do you think about that evaluation? And I think that you and Governor [PERSON] have been briefed by a [ORG] poll that is been taken. Does that contain the same sort of information? [INTERVIEWED]. No, the [ORG] poll -- I am not sure it is just because the committee paid for it -- is much stronger. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Higher ratings? [INTERVIEWER1]. What about the [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Higher, higher, higher. I am not sure. I do not want this to be considered a vicious assault on [ORG]. [Laughter] They are entitled to their polling figures. But the others were -- look, these things -- you know me on polls, [PERSON], [ORG]]. You have heard me on this subject before, and I have not changed my view. It is not a question of polls, but a question of what is going on, achieving what you are trying to do. And we are making some progress here. I am very pleased that the [ORG] did what it did on the savings and loan bill, pleased that we got a budget agreement that many cynics thought we could never achieve at all, no matter of what scope, whatsoever -- that took place. And so, I have been very pleased with the recent talks on the Middle East with [CARDINAL] leaders there. And so, things are moving. But I do not feel under any pressure to meet somebody else's standard on what is progress or not. I know what I am doing, and I think one thing is the country senses that. Otherwise, there would not be that kind of support. Aid to [NORP] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], are you going to offer military aid to the [NORP] resistance in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, no discussion of that yet, no decision taken on that yet. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], we are coming -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I will continue to give good support to the process and certainly to [President] [PERSON]'s efforts. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did you say no decision or no discussion on that? [INTERVIEWED]. No decision and -- not with me -- cannot recall, but I am not anywhere close to making a decision of that nature. Administration Accomplishments [INTERVIEWER1]. We are coming up to the [DATE] mark on your Presidency, which -- if you will look over [DATE], every other President, or almost every other President, has come into office at times of crisis, and crisis has been kind of a stage on which we watch Presidents perform. How would you assess [DATE] so far? [INTERVIEWED]. About the same as [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Uh-oh. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can you elaborate on that? [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] came in; he was not radically trying to change things. But then, that is about where the parallel ends, because I do not know what he did in [DATE]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- or any of [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. We got an agenda, and I have clicked off things that I think demonstrate progress. And I left out the whole question of an ethics package that I think is a very good one. We have had many visitors from foreign lands. We have moved forward on -- I want to add now to what I was saying -- moved forward on Third World debt in a positive way. So, I think that we are moving reasonably well. And I do not even think in terms of [DATE] because we are not radically shifting things; this is the [PERSON] analogy. We did not come in here throwing the rascals out to try to do something -- correct all the ills of the world in [DATE]. Now, there is some ills of the world; there is some unsolved problems. And I am methodically, I think, pragmatically moving forward on these. So, I really do not measure it in terms of [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. I guess we are the ones who measure [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. You are. Foreign Policy [INTERVIEWER1]. Foreign policy has been kind of held back. You have had visitors, but do you expect the pace of your foreign policy to pick up after this? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not sure I understand the question. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, the pace -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. The pace of it? No, I do not . The pace of it is pretty intense -- numbers of visitors, amount of time I spend on foreign policy, initiatives taken by the Secretary of [ORG], attention given to this in [ORG], [DATE]. So, you see, I think we have got prudent foreign policy. We have set into forward motion certain reviews that are moving towards completion. And so, I do not feel a need for some precipitous and dramatic initiative in order to salve the consciences of those who are saying you have got to do something in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Let me go back -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. These reviews will not trigger something then? [INTERVIEWED]. It could; it might. But I think [PERSON] -- on the [NORP] East-West relations -- understands what we are about. I, frankly, thought that what we said on [GPE] [DATE] was new and a strong initiative. But that takes time to sort out these things. But I did not do it because I wanted to get in under the [DATE] wire. Now, the question is: We have spelled out what we want to do, and I have got to move our bureaucracy to see that we do it. And you know, it is that kind of concept on the Middle East -- spent a lot of time on the Middle East. And I think King [PERSON] was right when he said [DATE] that the time is right for some kind of action. But now we have got to assess, after he leaves here, where we go, what next step we take. We have got something out there on elections that offers some promise. We have not backed away from historic positions on conference or whatever. And so, we move -- we take whatever the next step is. I wish I could give you a more dramatic answer to the [GPE], because this is one that really does hurt. And I am very, very concerned about it. And here all I can say to you is that we have encouraged the Secretary-General to go forward, to try this mission of peace. There is some stumbling blocks to that; I am told we will renew our call for removal of all foreign troops and for a cease-fire. But here is one where I wish that there was some dramatic plan in which the players in the area could agree to, and it is not there. And we have talked to the [NORP] leaders. But I cite this one because I really feel it -- about the [GPE], of the divisions in [GPE]. We have talked to the [NORP] about it. We have talked to the [NORP] about it -- and President [PERSON] [DATE]. And the people at the [ORG] are trying to figure. But there is not a dramatic plan that can bring peace to [GPE] right now. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that a problem that defies solution? [INTERVIEWED]. The problem -- the short-run of it -- how you stop this firing, the shelling, how you get factions to stop warring -- has certainly in [DATE] defied solution. But we cannot give up on it. We simply are not going to -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. How has the [GPE] managed to provide any kind of influence in the situation? [INTERVIEWED]. That is the problem: We do not have great influence in [GPE], with the factions that are fighting. We do have good influence with many of the countries out there. In fact, I think our standing with the moderate [NORP] countries is as good [DATE] as any time in recent history. And I feel strongly about that. And back to the [PERSON] theory -- I mean, we are building still, coming back out of a time that hit a bit of a low [DATE]. Then we restored some prestige by the way we acted in the Gulf. Then you see a cease-fire in the Gulf. We have, I think, much better communication now with [GPE]. We have kept good cooperation and coordination with the [NORP]. The [NORP] themselves attest to the fact that they have great confidence in our administration. We have some differences with all [CARDINAL] of those countries, but, no, I think it is moving. But, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], I wish there was a short-term answer to stop the killing in [GPE]. Strategic Weapons Modernization [INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- you missed a couple of deadlines -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], could I -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. You have missed a couple of deadlines on the MX missile, on what you are going to do to modernize the strategic arsenal -- go MX, [PERSON]. And Mr. [PERSON] gave you some recommendations [DATE], and a decision is expected [DATE]. What are you going to do on that? [INTERVIEWED]. Do not know yet. We will obviously be talking to [PERSON] when he comes back from [ORG]. But no decision has been taken. [INTERVIEWER1]. Any leaning? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, cannot tell you that. I am listening -- because this exercise [DATE] in [FAC] was not just a semantic drill of some sort. When I talk about cooperation with [ORG], I mean it -- consultation with [ORG], I mean it. And some of what [DATE] was about was getting the views of various Members of [ORG] on this decision that is facing [INTERVIEWED]. But how do you -- you know, what do you do about SDI and levels of funding? What do you do about MX or Midgetman? And I have to make the call, the recommendation, from here; but I wanted to get their input. Now I want to get renewed talks with [PERSON] when he comes back. The national security adviser has provided me with a lot of thinking on this, had several important briefings on it. And I will be prepared very soon to make a decision on it. But we have not -- I cannot go any further than that. Middle East Peace Process [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you met now with [[NORP] President] [PERSON], [[NORP] Prime Minister] [PERSON], and [[NORP] King] [PERSON]. What is the next step in the Middle East peace process? [INTERVIEWED]. Not sure now. On the table is the election process, and [CARDINAL] other thing would be how we flesh that out, taking into consideration the concerns about it that have been expressed by [PERSON] and by King [PERSON] and also by Mr. [PERSON]. So, how we do that -- what the modalities are of that -- a lot of thought will be going into that: who is represented; making clear that this is not a final step, that that is not going to solve the Middle East problem; making clear that it is a step, but we want it to be a constructive step; and exploring other options as well. [INTERVIEWER1]. What is the structural procedure for doing that? [INTERVIEWED]. On the [GPE] side, we will use the [ORG] procedures to do that. And of course, I plan to be in touch with the various leaders. I have told them I want to do that as President. And I do plan to talk personally with some of the leaders out there on these matters -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. Is this a high priority? [INTERVIEWED]. -- -- in addition to the ones I have already talked to. For example, I talked to King [PERSON] [of [GPE]] [DATE], and think that that is useful, to be sure. Now, after this round of visits, what do they think? A lot of these countries can be important players here, and the more agreement we can get on the next step, the more likely it is to succeed. [GPE] [GPE] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], on the [GPE]: Is it time to say that [DATE] battleships are, in fact, obsolete and begin taking them out of service? Is that the lesson here? [INTERVIEWED]. No, that is -- -- [INTERVIEWER1]. Or if not, what is your lesson on it? [INTERVIEWED]. That is not -- well, my lesson is that -- to find out what happened in infinite detail, check all procedures to be sure that safety is at the highest point, and -- but not -- I would not jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that that makes a useful platform obsolete. I am not going to go that far. Drug Testing [INTERVIEWER1]. Could you indulge me [CARDINAL] quick question because of a conflict that the Attorney General suggested [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], give me a break. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] quick one. The Attorney General -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Is this for TV or is this for the print? [INTERVIEWER1]. TV. Q. Both. The Attorney General suggested [DATE] that it might be appropriate to drug-test people in public housing. [ORG] took immediate exception to that. What do you think? [INTERVIEWED]. I'd have to talk to him about it because I do not know, and I am not going to go off on some tangent here until I know exactly the thinking of our key [ORG] people. We have got a good [ORG] system, and I encourage people to speak out. But the decisions on something of that nature will be made right here in that room, and they are not going to be made until I have all the facts. [INTERVIEWER1]. You do not favor a drug -- -- Interest Rates [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you expect interest rates to come down now that you have got a budget agreement? [INTERVIEWED]. I was very pleased at the market reaction to the budget agreement. It seems to have been underreported, but nevertheless, it is very heartening, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [INTERVIEWER1]. How about the interest rates? You said you were going to campaign -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I am not heartened by the interest rates. [Laughter] Drug Testing [INTERVIEWER1]. Is there still going to be those drug tests for the [ORG] employees? [INTERVIEWED]. Selectively, yes, absolutely. [INTERVIEWER1]. Selectively? To everybody? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have already got some patterns out there -- well, widely. If we are talking about a drug-free workplace, we have got to have some testing, and I support that. This idea that this is a total infringement on everybody -- I do not agree. Now, in some cases -- I mean, I do not want it to be so widespread, but I do think that selective drug testing is very important, and nobody will change my mind on that one. [INTERVIEWER1]. Civil rights? Human -- no? [INTERVIEWED]. Civil rights is very important, too -- and so is the law.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorpsthesituationpanama", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. Let me take a couple of questions. But first, a word about [GPE], just to be very clear. And if I were speaking to the [NORP] people, I would tell them that the affection of the [NORP] people for the people of [GPE] is still very much intact, strong. Secondly, I would say to [ORG], the [ORG], they have a useful role to play, and they will in the future of [GPE] have a useful role to play. The problem is not the [ORG], per se; the problem is [PERSON]. And if [PERSON] were to leave office, we would have good relations with [GPE]. We would have good relations with [ORG]. And clearly, the good feelings between the [NORP] people and the people of [GPE] would grow and prosper. And so, I would hope that [PERSON] would leave and that the results of this election would be recognized. The fraud in the election has been condemned by people all across the world; [ORG], leaders in our hemisphere, all the way to [GPE] -- people speaking out in indignation against this thuggery and against what the man has done. So, I just want to be sure that the people of [GPE] understand that relations can quickly return to normal if Mr. [PERSON] will leave and set aside his dictatorship and permit democracy to prevail. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think they have any doubt about that? And are not you calling for a coup on the part of the [ORG]? I mean, [ORG] in [GPE] also has basically been saying the same thing to the PDF. Are you saying [INTERVIEWED]. That I just said? [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that you would like the [ORG] to get [PERSON] out? [INTERVIEWED]. I would love to see them get him out. We'd like to see him out of there -- not just the PDF, the will of the people of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. It sounds like you are calling on the people of [GPE] to rise up and basically have a revolution. Is that what you are trying to say? [INTERVIEWED]. A revolution -- the people rose up and spoke in a democratic election, with a tremendous turnout, said what they wanted. The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of these Doberman thugs. That is what I am saying. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think the people should do now? [INTERVIEWED]. The people should do everything they can to have the will of the people respected. They ought to heed the international calls, and they ought to just do everything they can to get Mr. [PERSON] out of there. [INTERVIEWER1]. Have you been in conversation and contact with President [PERSON] and others? [GPE] apparently has offered [PERSON] asylum. Have you been in contact with the [NORP], and do you have thoughts on when and where [PERSON] should go? [INTERVIEWED]. No, but I have no doubt that countries would receive him. [INTERVIEWER1]. Why, have you had any assurances indirectly on that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have a habit of not liking to go into detail with what I talk to others about. But I am just confident that they would receive him, and I think [PERSON] knows this, too. [INTERVIEWER1]. You said [DATE] that you would not favor dropping the drug indictments. But if he were to go to someplace that, either through prearrangement or postarrangement, did not have extradition arrangements with the [GPE], how would you feel about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that could well be an answer. That could be a solution. [INTERVIEWER1]. What? Going to a country that [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, because if he has -- no, he was saying, if there was a country that prohibited extradition -- and he ought to think about that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Would you allow him to go to a country [INTERVIEWED]. think we have any control over that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Would you allow him into a country that did not have an extradition [INTERVIEWED]. He can go anywhere he wants. But I am obligated as [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] to respect our laws and to go forward on fulfilling obligations under the law. But if he went to a place where there was not any extradition treaty, then that would be a different situation than if he went to a place where there was an extradition treaty. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you care which one he does? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'd like him to -- well, I care that he does whatever it is that it takes to get him out of there right now. And that is what I'd like to see happen. [INTERVIEWER1]. more than getting him [INTERVIEWED]. I think it is right for the people of [GPE]. It is right for the democracies in this hemisphere. You cannot have an election that is blatantly stolen, where people that win are beaten up by thugs. [INTERVIEWER1]. So far, you have struck out -- and so did President [PERSON] -- in trying to get him out of power. Do you have any other options? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, they have not been successful. [INTERVIEWED]. Still at the plate, and we will stay at the plate until we can help the people of [GPE] have the democracy for which they spoke so articulately in an election. And we are not going to give up on it. [INTERVIEWER1]. This effort will not be a success until he leaves, right? [INTERVIEWED]. No effort can be a success until he leaves. That is right. [INTERVIEWER1]. [DATE], you said that the goal of your sending those extra troops down there was to protect [NORP] lives. Now you seem to be adding a new, much more outspoken dimension to your intention here, which is to see [PERSON] leave and leave [INTERVIEWED]. I am not changing the definition of the role of the [NORP] troops at all. [INTERVIEWER1]. Have you had any contact with him indirectly, sir, in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE]? No. [INTERVIEWER1]. How about directly [INTERVIEWED]. No, you asked the question properly. [INTERVIEWER1]. How does it feel personally, after [DATE] of seeing this drag on -- -- now this thing comes to a head? How does it feel when you read the accounts and see the pictures? [INTERVIEWED]. See, I think there is a whole new ingredient in [GPE], regarding the relationship with [GPE]. And the ingredient is the election. And I think the election made so clear that the people want democracy and made so clear that that democracy is being thwarted by [CARDINAL] man that that in itself could be the catalyst for removing [PERSON]. Now, why do I say that? Because, heretofore, you have not heard the neighboring countries around [GPE] speaking up. Now they are speaking up loud and clear. You have not heard the [ORG] as indignant as it is now. You have not seen the [ORG] [[ORG]], our friends in Europe, speaking up and denouncing what happened. And I think the [NORP] weighed in on this. So, I think this is a very different climate now and one much more conducive to possible change, because the people spoke so overwhelmingly, and heretofore, that has not been quite as clear. Never underestimate the power of the people, even though their will seems to have been frustrated short-run. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think the [ORG] [[ORG]] will do something on [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], I would hope so, and I think it would be helpful if they did. And I'd love to see a very powerful and strong statement coming out of there, and I'd like to see it as unanimous. But I am not sure what will come out of it. But I think it is well worth the effort. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED] -- you are worried about the people in [GPE] and what they have gone through, and it is in their hands. Are you concerned, though, about any violence that might be started by anything that the people would do to change the situation where innocent lives may be lost or children would be hurt and families disrupted as they try to make a change for democracy? [INTERVIEWED]. I always worry about the loss of innocent human life. And I would be worried about that. [INTERVIEWER1]. What about [NORP] [INTERVIEWER1]. Would you caution them against rising up in violence? [INTERVIEWED]. [NORP] life? We will protect [NORP] lives in every possible way. That is a solemn responsibility of [INTERVIEWED], and that is one of the reasons I augmented our forces in [GPE] -- is the reason I augmented them. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you concerned that the situation there -- with your calls and mounting pressure internationally -- would lead to a situation right now in [GPE] that might lead to violence that would, in fact, endanger [NORP] lives more than they would be otherwise? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is too hypothetical. I mean, I would be concerned about any escalation of violence that would endanger [NORP] lives. And I think we are in a good position to protect our [NORP] lives and interests. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], your words could be seen, though, as inciteful, basically saying to the [NORP] people that it is up to them: Do not let it die. Your will seems to have been thwarted, but you have got to hang tough. The people could see that as inflammatory, like it is a call to -- -- to revolt. Would you add any words of caution [INTERVIEWED]. No, I would add no words of caution. The will of the people should be implemented. And if I wanted to increase the rhetoric, strengthen it, I would do so. But I think I have phrased it just about the way I feel. [INTERVIEWER1]. And the will includes [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER1]. And the will includes -- -- demonstrations in the street? What form would you say [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I am not about to get into proposing a [CARDINAL]-point action plan for the people of [GPE]. All I want them to know is that if they get rid of [PERSON] they will have an instant normalization of relationship with [GPE] and there will be a useful role for [ORG]. And I think there has been some doubt about that, perhaps in [ORG] itself, as to how we now view the [ORG], because of the thuggery of its leader. And this gives me an opportunity to clarify that specific point, as well as to repeat my support for [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON], who was so brutally beaten. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you contemplating sending even more [NORP] troops down there now? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, if I were, it would be unlikely I would announce it here, just before landing in [GPE], only because I think it would be prudent to do it differently. But I will answer your question, though: I have no short-run plans, but that does not preclude anything I will do in the future. [INTERVIEWER1]. You know [PERSON]. Is it strictly power that he wants or is there a point where he could be negotiated out? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know, [PERSON]. I think it is power that he has wanted, but I do not know what his view is now that he is seen a total repudiation of his rule. And you see, I keep coming back to the fact that what happened [DATE] in the election is something quite different than has been on the table before. So, I just do not know the answer to it. It might be now he'd like to find a way to get out. I would hope that would be the case, but I do not know that for a fact. He has lost all support, all respect -- the man is considered just out of it, an outlaw, by the world community now as a result of what happened. But I do not know. It is a good question, yet I do not know how to answer. I do not have an answer for it. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that [GPE] at this juncture has, more or less, done what it could and that now what we are going to do is lend moral support to whatever the [NORP] decide? That we really cannot from the outside do anything further? [INTERVIEWED]. No, what I have said is that we have taken certain action to protect [NORP] lives. I have now spelled out, although I hope it had been understood before, what it would take to have good relations with [GPE]; and I will continue my own efforts internationally. You see, I do think it is important that it not be [GPE], [PERSON], coming down there to try to dictate to the people of [GPE]. And that is one of the reasons I spent a lot of time [DATE] working with the international community and instructing [ORG] to do the same thing. So, we will continue our international efforts. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you disappointed in the response to that of the [ORG] and some of the [NORP] to why you sent the troops down there? Are you disappointed in their response? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am not sure I know what their response has been. The PDF response? [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes. I mean, you have come out here to clarify your views. [INTERVIEWED]. No, I am not disappointed in the response. What I am trying to do is make clear to [ORG] that there is no vendetta against [ORG] as an institution. There is clearly the desire to see Mr. [PERSON] get out of office. I do not know how they have reacted to the [NORP] forces. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], how long can the people of [GPE] be expected to put up with [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE] they demonstrated loud and clear they do not want any more. They have had it; and their will should be respected and honored. So, we have got to find a way to have that magnificent expression of democracy be honored. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are there certain things that you and the administration are sending them immediately, once [PERSON] leaves? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. We'd recognize immediately the [PERSON] government. As soon as he is sworn in, we would return our Ambassador; we would remove our economic sanctions; we would, in essence, have normalized relations with a country for whom we have great affection and whose people have great affection for us. If you talk to those [CARDINAL] delegations that came back, both of them -- the liberal members of the delegation, the conservative members, the [NORP], the [NORP] -- all of them certified, stipulated that the people of [GPE] have great affection for our country and for our people. So, you'd see an instant release of this oppression; and you'd see an effort by [GPE] to help [GPE] go down the road to democracy and to help them economically, as best we could, and to welcome them as they rejoin the family of democracies in this hemisphere. That would happen instantly. We would not need a lot of delaying or thinking about it either. But it has to have the -- with that -- it is the departure of [PERSON] and the recognition of the people's will; those [CARDINAL] have to go together. [INTERVIEWER1]. Was there some development [TIME] or some intelligence that you got that caused this [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, but I know because I was talking to General [PERSON] [Assistant to [INTERVIEWED] for National Security Affairs] [DATE] and talked to Secretary [of [ORG]] [PERSON] [TIME]. And I have had an uneasy feeling that perhaps what I have told you here [DATE] was not known clearly there. And it gives me a chance to -- well, the question as to how we view [ORG] itself, what would happen if [PERSON] left, vis-a-vis [GPE], and I hope it is known that [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. You think that [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think in a situation of this nature, where the head of the [ORG] has become such a pariah, that there perhaps -- been misunderstanding there as to how we view the institution itself and other of its officers. But if they come in there and [PERSON] goes and they respect the will of the people, I -- you know, we see a very useful role for [ORG], in their own internal security and for their own -- any threat they might feel they had to the external security. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], has the [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]. I really do have to go. [INTERVIEWER1]. If the PDF asked for [GPE] military help, how can we respond? What would we do? [INTERVIEWED]. Asked for it to do what? [INTERVIEWER1]. If they asked for military support -- if the PDF asks for military support from [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Support for what? [INTERVIEWER1]. Military troops. [INTERVIEWED]. For what purpose? [INTERVIEWER1]. To move in on [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. If the PDF asks for support to get rid of [PERSON], they would not need support from [GPE] to get rid of [PERSON]. He is [CARDINAL] man, and they have a well-trained force. That is my [INTERVIEWER1]. What about if -- -- opposition asked for military support? [INTERVIEWED]. I have outlined what we are doing. I have outlined what we are doing. I'd love to see this be resolved diplomatically. And when you have overwhelming world opinion on your side, maybe something is possible in the short-range future that has not been possible over the difficult past. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you still expect a smooth summit in terms of resolving the missile issue? [INTERVIEWED]. We will work it out. [INTERVIEWER1]. This is [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. No, no, it is a good question. It will work out. This alliance is strong.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool", "text": "About Search [INTERVIEWED]. First of all, it is progress. Great success happens when there is [CARDINAL] states, living side by side in peace. And this is progress. I thought I would-since this is an historic trip, I thought I would just have you up and share thoughts and answer questions. We will go around for a while. First, I am pleased with what happened [DATE] and [DATE]. The first signs of peace happen when people make up their mind to work toward peace. And that is what you saw. You heard some pretty firm statements [DATE]. The statements [DATE] by the [NORP] leaders were very strong in public, and they were strong in private. [CARDINAL] of the things that we have made clear to all parties is that there are terrorists who have to blow up the process-you all know that; it is been an historic fact-and that these countries in the neighborhood have the capacity to work to cut off money to the terrorist groups and access and arms deals. And they committed themselves to do that, which was a positive sign. It was also important for Prime Minister [PERSON] to hear that. This is a man who is a newly elected Prime Minister, new to office. He gets sworn in, and the roadmap gets released. All of a sudden now he finds himself in a serious effort, the creation of a [NORP] state, which puts enormous responsibilities on him. And one of the things we are saying is, you are now responsible. But it helped a lot to have the [NORP] leaders support him, and not only support him but to support him through pledges of activity and action. The Crown Prince of [GPE] was particularly strong [DATE] in private about the need to chase down terrorists. They have had some recent experience with terrorism. And I was really pleased with the strong commitment and the strong desire to not only deal with terrorists inside his country but to work to prevent arms being smuggled from-out of [GPE] and into the territories. We also spent a lot of time talking about [GPE] and the mutual concern about [GPE] and the desire to convince [GPE] to shut down terrorist offices inside-in [GPE]. So there was a very helpful discussion. I think it was very helpful for Prime Minister [PERSON] to hear that. Then we come to [DATE]. The way [DATE] worked is that I met with the King of [GPE]. He is a wonderful man. He is obviously desirous of [NORP] statehood, which would be very helpful to him. We talked about bilateral relations, economic- matters of economic development, and it was a good conversation. And then I sat down with Prime Minister [PERSON]. I assured him that security was at the top of our agenda, like security is at the top of his agenda. [CARDINAL], we are in a war against terror, or a war against terror on the homefront; we are chasing down these people around. But we also recognize that there are some who would like to blow up the process and that we want to work to create the conditions for a [NORP] state to emerge, which means jointly working with all parties to work on the security issue. I also told him, though, he is got responsibilities. The fact that he showed up meant that he believes Prime Minister [PERSON] can deliver. And therefore, we have got to work together to help the Prime Minister achieve his stated objectives, which, [CARDINAL], he had a very clear statement on terror. The other thing that was very interesting was his statement on incitement. And it was a fact statement, for those who follow the process. He needs time to get his security forces set up. And I reminded the Prime Minister-I also reminded him that I was not caught by surprise by his statement on the outposts, the issue of the outposts. He said he would dismantle them; we expect him now to dismantle them. People say, Well, what is the first step? Well, you just heard the first step [DATE] in the speeches. And the-you also heard me say that we would help [ORG] develop a security force. Minister [PERSON] will be in charge of that security force. We intend to work with them. We assured the [NORP] we intend to work with them. We want this man to be successful. The Prime Minister absolutely rejected terror. In order for him to be effective in rejecting terror, he is got to have an effective security force. And so that is what we discussed. And then we met, all of us together, our delegations. It was good. We had a- the discussion was very interesting is the Prime Minister asked members of his [ORG] to speak, Minister of [ORG], the Deputy Prime Minister, the equivalent of the Attorney General, Minister of Justice. And then Prime Minister [PERSON] spoke; I spoke. And then I suggested that the [CARDINAL] of us just go outside and visit, rather than having the formal settings of the old roundtable discussion. And so we went out and sat on the lawn there for [TIME] and discussed a lot of matters. What I wanted to do is to observe the interplay between the [CARDINAL]; did they have the capacity to relax in each other's presence, for starters? And I felt they did. In other words, it was-the body language was positive. There was not a lot of hostility or suspicion. There was a-it seemed like to me, from the conversation, that there was a mutual desire to work toward the vision. And obviously I am not going to betray confidences, but it was a very interesting and positive conversation, is the best way to say it. I did not need, for example, to be Mr. [PERSON]-you know, kind of, Hey, fellows. [Laughter] There was a natural tendency to want to talk about common matters and common desires. And then after that, we gave our speeches, and here we sit. I will tell you that I am pleased with [DATE]. We have made a good beginning. And I emphasize beginning, because there is a lot of work to do. Let me just review some of the work that must take place. Obviously, there needs-there needs to be a focused, complete, [PERCENT]percent effort to fight off the terrorists. I believe the [NORP]-I know the [NORP] leadership wants that, has got that desire. And so, he must help them put the institutions in place to do that. On the [NORP] side, there needs to be an emergence of a state, the institutions of which are larger than the participants. And that is essential. I assured the Prime Minister of [ORG]-and this was when we were sitting out on the lawn-that there is plenty of help coming. At the G-8 meeting in [GPE], there was a lot of discussion about how we can help, What can we do? I said, Well, when the time is right, there is going to be need for money and commercial development and enhancement of the entrepreneurial spirit. There is just a lot of things to be done- better education systems. [GPE] has got to recognize that Prime Minister [PERSON] is desirous for peace and, without compromising security, must make decisions necessary to help the [NORP] people. And they are doing that. Money is-more money is now in circulation. They collect revenues, [GPE] does, and now they are -they have got great trust in the Finance Minister of [ORG], a guy who went to [ORG], by the way, for a while. He came to [GPE] as an intermediary on behalf of Prime Minister [PERSON], and [PERSON] and I met with him in [FAC]. I spent a lot of the time on [NORP] finances, cashflow matters, making sure that aid and money actually end up helping the people and not either bank accounts of individuals that-where it does not belong. I am absolutely convinced he is an honest and upright man who believes in the future of the [NORP] people, believes that a democratic [NORP] state is possible. It is important for Prime Minister [PERSON] to recognize that. I think he does. I am confident he recognizes that. The [MONEY] that had been held in arrears was released, and the process of talking about more money going through, which-25, [CARDINAL] workers now that were not allowed in [GPE] now allowed in [GPE]. In other words, what I am telling you is, is that it is important for the life of the [NORP] to improve in measurable ways. And as confidence is built, as institutions are in place, I assured Prime Minister [PERSON]-and this was important for Prime Minister [PERSON] to hear as well-that there is going to be a lot of help, financial help, from around the world. People want this effort to succeed. And so it is -it is a bit of-2 good days, but there is a lot to happen. Let me just go around the table. [INTERVIEWER1]. You sound cautious still. [INTERVIEWED]. I am cautious, because- and I am cautious because history tells you to be cautious. I do not know where you were in [DATE]. I guess it was-they were close. There are killers lurking in the neighborhood. There are people who have declared their-openly declared their hostility to [GPE] and their desire to destroy [NORP] citizens. There are people that, you know, would rather have chaos than a state. And so long as you know they are there, you have got to be cautious. And on the other hand, we have now got a partner in peace, Prime Minister [PERSON], who is-wants the tools necessary to chase them down. It is going to be one of the accountability measures, by the way. That is one of reasons why we put [PERSON]. The news [DATE], of course, from our side was, besides having the meeting, was Ambassador [PERSON] and his team. It is not just [PERSON]. It is not [PERSON] and [CARDINAL] administrative assistant. It is [PERSON] and a team of people that the Secretary will be glad to explain to you. We have a security team there to help the [PERSON]. Their job is to find out what is needed and to also hold people to account, both sides to account, reminding people of promises made in meetings and insisting them that in order for progress to be made, people have got to deliver it. And so, yes, I have cautious, but optimistic. Perhaps we should say, cautiously optimistic. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], previous efforts at making peace in the Middle East did not succeed. You believe you now have a chance. Did you-and you also mentioned that it is historic-this was an historic meeting. Could you try to put this in history? What do you think has changed since you took office, and how did we get to this point? [INTERVIEWED]. I think a couple of things have changed. [CARDINAL], I think there is-I think Prime Minister [PERSON] is willing to make the necessary decisions and take the necessary steps to fight terror and to develop institutions necessary for a state to emerge, a genuine effort. I believe he is, and that is a change. Secondly, there is a universal recognition that the war on terror is just that, a war on terror and not empty words, that [DATE] or bombings in [GPE] or the terror that has plagued [GPE], these are terrorist acts that must be defeated, and they must be defeated at its source as well. So there is a different-frankly, a different attitude toward terrorism. It is no longer isolated terrorism, it is terrorism that is beginning to affect a lot of people and can affect a lot of people. So in other words, the meeting [DATE], for example, with the [NORP] nations, it seemed like to me the new reality was reflected in their statements, which will make it easier for a [NORP] state to emerge. There is a vested interest to fight terror. It is people's self-interest now. And so I think that is been one of the changes. I am sure this is-other Presidents have said this; other leaders have-but there is now battle fatigue. People are sick and tired of it. People are sick and tired of the death, suffering, of the humiliation. In other words, there is -hopefully history will show whether or not I am right, but hopefully we have reached the point where a lot of good people have begun to realize that the immediate past will lead to nothing but more suffering and humiliation and death. And people are beginning to change their attitudes on the ground. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think September 11th had an impact in the region, as well, in help-ing-did it just galvanize [NORP] views about terrorism, or did it also carry through into-- [INTERVIEWED]. I think it-the terror attacks shocked the world. And it frightened a lot of people, because they realized that if [GPE] can be hit, they could be hit. And then terror began to-I just said, the attacks in [GPE] or the attacks in [GPE], [GPE], a nice secure resort community. The next thing is, people wake up [DATE] and realize-around the world realize that there is no such thing as a nice, secure resort when we have terrorists willing to kill innocent lives in the numbers they did. So not just [DATE]. [DATE] made the world aware of the new war. And then the other acts of terror that have taken place since made the issue come even closer to home for many countries. And then the combination of that plus the terrorist activities in the [NORP] territories and in [GPE] made people realize the effects of terror. It kind of brought it all home, I think. So, yes, I think [DATE] mattered, but it was not the only event that was-helped galvanize thought. People are frightened about terror in the Middle East, not just in [GPE]. And they have got to get after it. And we are going to help them get after it. It is a part of this war. One of the hardest things I knew that I would have to do as [INTERVIEWED] is to remind the [NORP] people, and for that matter, people around the world, the nature of the war in which we find ourselves. And it is different. There is a couple battlefronts that are noticeable, [GPE] and [GPE], but this war goes on. I mean, [DATE], as we speak, we have got intelligence sharing going on, we have got people on the hunt trying to find them, [CARDINAL] at a time. It is that same effort that will take place in the [NORP] territories, but it requires the desire by all leaders to want to fight it. I think that is changed some. I think it is changed a lot mentality. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you seem to value and even enjoy the spontaneity and informality that you brought in your meetings with these leaders. Could you dwell for a moment on your personal style of diplomacy and how you see it working? [INTERVIEWED]. I try to tell the truth, put it right out there on the table for everybody to understand what is expected. I do; I like people. You know, I remember, I think it was- [PERSON] [[ORG]] asked me the question, Do you trust [PERSON]? It was one of the really interesting questions, to fire up [INTERVIEWED] standing next to [PERSON]. Well, the answer is yes, I did not hesitate, because during my meeting with him, I had developed an interesting rapport. My instincts were such that, this is a guy I can trust. History will prove me right. It does not necessarily mean he has to agree with everything that I say, but trust his word. I have spent enough time with [PERSON] to know he is the kind of guy when he says something, he means it. I am getting the same sense about Prime Minister [PERSON]. And therefore much of the conversations, particularly as I get to know somebody, is to figure out whether or not you can- whether or not, when they say something, they mean it. You can tell that, pretty much, during a conversation, which means trying to get people off their script, and as you discuss things, make it as informal as possible, because I think people in an informal setting tend to show their heart and/or their conscience in a lot better way. I am not a very formal guy to begin with. [PERSON] and the Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], can give you a better sense of what my style is like. I am also not very analytical. You know I do not spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things. The meetings are informal; they are kind of relaxed. I think one of my styles is trying to relax people. National Security Adviser [PERSON]. Direct, I would say. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am a direct person. I mean, there is no-we do not have a lot of time, and therefore I like to get to the point. I like to ask people-I can challenge people. I believe I can do so in a way that is not offensive to them. It is about as encouraging as it was discouraging. And I hope they sense my sense of optimism. I mean, I am an enthusiastic person when I believe that something is possible. I believe peace is possible. I know it is going to be hard, but I think the fact that I am representing a great country and am willing to sit down with these leaders and give them a sense, We are all in this together, is helpful. The best way to do that is in a more informal type setting where there is not a lot of prepared notes. I have been in meetings where people read speeches. It is not as productive as a meeting in which people can sit down and actually-one of my jobs is to try to help relax people in a setting. I hope I am pretty good at that. How do you feel? Do you feel relaxed right now? [INTERVIEWER1]. More relaxed than I should. [INTERVIEWED]. It worked. Meeting With Arab Leaders [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that what happened when you were in the the anteroom with the [NORP] leaders, you just decided that it was a more relaxed setting and that you prefer to keep talking-- [INTERVIEWED]. Exactly, yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Could you tell us a little bit about that meeting and what went on in that meeting? [INTERVIEWED]. Sure, I'd love to. First of all, I understand that there was a little bit of hard feelings. I was told [TIME] about certain press was not in. We had no idea. I am available for any photo op. [Laughter] But it was not an intention, if that is -that is the meeting I think you are talking about, the informal meeting. [INTERVIEWER1]. Multilateral. But we'd like to know what happened in the private meeting that you had with the heads of state before you came out. [INTERVIEWED]. Before we came out, the thing that was not supposed to be on TV, that one. It was just a roundtable discussion about-let me make sure I get it right here. I told them, I said, look-all [CARDINAL] of those leaders, except for Prime Minister [PERSON], were-Prime Minister [PERSON] was there. The other [CARDINAL] leaders are leaders who I obviously talked to during the Iraq war. Before the Iraq war and after the Iraq war, I assured them that I was going to be involved in moving the Middle East peace process forward, particularly after the emergence of the Prime Minister, [PERSON]. This was my chance to go around the table and look him in the eye and say, I am here to make it happen, but I need your help. The first thing was to-is to let them know about the intent of this administration. I shared with them-well, you know [PERSON]'s involvement and [PERSON]'s involvement. I did not share with them the [PERSON]-I knew they would read about it [DATE]. There was not any great secret. On the other hand, you occasionally try to hold back some news-you have probably learned it before I did, anyway. And then we listened to them, and Crown Prince [PERSON]. And they had a lot of interesting thoughts about different issues. Oh, and by the way, it was not just- the discussion was not just on the Middle East peace process. The other thing I told them, I asked them, was to help Prime Minister [PERSON]. I directly said, We need your help on this fellow. If he is to succeed, if peace is to succeed, he needs your help. And they were willing; they expressed their desire to help. And I went to [GPE] and talked about what was happening there. Then I encouraged them to continue on their paths to reform and about how that would make a significant difference in the lives of their citizens. So it was more than-and they commented on all that, different aspects. I am not going to tell you what they told me. If they want to tell you what-if they want to say what is theirs, they will put it in their own press. It was a long discussion. It took a lot longer than we thought. And part of it had to do because a lot of it needed to be translated. Therefore, a normal conversation-all of it had to be translated. The Crown Prince does not speak English very well, so therefore every word that was spoken had to volleyed. And so that is -we had a good conversation, again, not structured. People said what they felt like, and there was no-it was not just, Okay, you speak; you speak; you speak, and then we are through. There was a lot of interchange. That is positive. And I met bilaterally with them as well. I met with-[PERSON] and [PERSON] and I went over to President [PERSON]'s house [TIME]. We had a bilateral with him in the morning, and afterwards we ate. I had a bilateral with the Crown Prince at the hotel after the sauna bath. It was very hot outside when I spoke. [Laughter] Thank you for clarification. It was hot. I am sweating. I was really hot. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know, I know there was [CARDINAL] place where you were talking about it, figuratively-- [INTERVIEWED]. Figuratively, that is right. Just to see if you were paying attention. And it is very useful to have those kind of conversations. [ORG] Leadership [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], a big part of why you were here, and you made clear, is because [PERSON] is the person who is [NORP] Prime Minister, and [PERSON] is not the person who you chose to negotiate. But [NORP] leaders, some of their senior officials, made clear that they still think [PERSON]-they made clear that they still think [PERSON] is somebody who needs to be dealt with, who needs to negotiate. I am wondering what kinds of conversations you had with the [NORP] leaders and maybe with [PERSON] about [PERSON]'s role? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is clear that I am going to deal with Prime Minister [PERSON], so there was not much conversation. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it will come up? [INTERVIEWED]. Not really. The Secretary of [ORG] is-- Secretary [PERSON]. It did not come up in any of the conversations with [INTERVIEWED] that I am aware of. And they know our views on this. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have any concern that he might be a hindrance to the process at all? [INTERVIEWED]. Not if he has the [NORP] people's interests at heart. We will see. I certainly hope not. Secretary [PERSON]. Can I just-- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, please. Secretary [PERSON]. In conversations with the [NORP] leaders, particularly the Foreign Ministers, we made it clear to them that one of the things we expected them to help with was to make sure that Mr. [PERSON] does not become an obstacle to the execution of the roadmap. [INTERVIEWER1]. Did they seem to say that they were willing to do that? Secretary [PERSON]. They understood. They will help. [INTERVIEWED]. I think they understand. Secretary [PERSON]'s Role [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. It really did not -I mean, he is handled most of that. It did not come up during my conversations with the [NORP] leaders. What came up was, how do we help Prime Minister [PERSON]? Now, [PERSON] may have had different-with the Foreign Ministers, since they have some frank discussions. A lot of times you will find out that the underbrush has been cleared by the- and by the time [INTERVIEWED] arrives, everybody kind of understands. And one of his jobs is to clear out underbrush. That is an old ranch term. [Laughter] In other words-I do not know what he told the Foreign Ministers, but I just heard what he told the Foreign Ministers. [INTERVIEWER1]. He is watching the calluses on his hands. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that is it. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you, just a followup? [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. Red Sea Summit [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you consider sort of the importance of the role of [INTERVIEWED] in this kind of process? For example, this is the first time-it is been [DATE] since you have been President. It is the first time you have had this kind of summit, where some of your predecessors had multiple summits by this time. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, first of all, we have had a lot of meetings but not summits. I have had a lot of discussions with every one of the parties that have been around the table, with the exception of Prime Minister [PERSON], and he is just showed up. He just emerged as a leader. I called him immediately upon-I think immediately or soon after he became Prime Minister. I mean, so-let me-just because we have not had the summit does not mean this administration has not been working toward achieving the conditions necessary to move forward. And that is really an important- there has to be-I can remember saying this to the press corps early on in my administration. People want to have to- peace, want peace. In order to move the process forward requires a-there is no need to spend capital and energy and time if there is not a commitment to peace. And the conditions are such now that there is a commitment to peace by a lot of people that are ready to see if we cannot make it happen. That is what is changed. And therefore the timing of this summit was really based upon the attitudes of the decisionmakers. We are not the decision-maker. Oh, the [NORP] President or the [NORP] Secretary of [ORG] is-I wish we were the decisionmakers. You know, Okay, this is it. That is not the way it works. There is terrorists to deal with. If we could, we'd say, All the terrorists, put down your arms and become useful citizens, peaceful citizens. But that is not, unfortunately, reality. Banding together, though, we can deal with the ticket-you know, build up the will necessary to deal with the terrorists. And so what the role of [GPE] is, is to lay out the vision, encourage people to accept the vision, and then help implement the vision. In this case, we call it a roadmap to achieve the vision. And that is exactly what we are going to do. We can be stewards of accountability. And we can say to somebody, You said you'd do this. You have not done it. You say you want to do this, and what do you need to get it done? So [DATE] we asked [PERSON], What is it you need? How can we help you? This is a security matter. What exactly can we do to help? Secretary [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], can I give [CARDINAL] data points to show [INTERVIEWED]'s involvement? Just a couple of quick data points to show you how we got here and how [INTERVIEWED] caused us to be here. [CARDINAL] [DATE] speech you are very familiar with. On [DATE], [INTERVIEWED] had [NORP] Foreign Ministers in the Oval Office-[PERSON] of [GPE], [PERSON] of [GPE], [PERSON] of [GPE]. And at that meeting, [INTERVIEWED] said to them, we will now structure a way to go from my vision to reality. And that was the beginning of the work on the roadmap. Work went on [DATE], [DATE]. And then on [DATE], the [NORP]-the [ORG] came together to finalize it. [INTERVIEWED] met with the [ORG], finalized it, and then we waited for the [NORP] elections to be over, which were just about finished at that time, and then we said, with the appointment of new leadership in [ORG], [INTERVIEWED] is ready to act, and he did. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], in the events of [DATE], have they exceeded what you expected coming over here? [INTERVIEWED]. That is a good question. I am supposed to say-that is an interesting question. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. You are supposed to say what you think. [INTERVIEWED]. I am the master of low expectations. I think they-we did what we wanted to-I think we-we accomplished what I hoped we would accomplish, but I do not think we necessarily exceeded expectations. I think met expectations is a better way to put it. I was hoping to have honest dialogs. The statements that came out-I think when you analyze the statements, you will find them to be historic, I guess is the right word to use. Amazing things were said. The [NORP]-the Prime Minister of [ORG] talked about the suffering of [NORP] people. It is a strong statement. The Prime Minister of [GPE] talked about a [NORP] state which was free. The statements were strong. It is hard to answer, exceeded expectations. I had a little bit of an understanding of what might take place, because we worked hard. These trips, obviously, do not just happen. The statement just does not show up out of the blue. It requires- [laughter]-- National Security Adviser [PERSON]. Oh, no, they just appeared magically. [INTERVIEWED]. I am a great delegator; I am a great delegator. And so they met expectations. However, the cordial atmosphere- I will tell you what else was interesting, that I would say met expectations or was pleasing to see, was the interface between [ORG] and [ORG]. When we went out to sit on the grounds- and I witnessed some of it but not all of it since I was actually on the grounds- [PERSON] and [PERSON] told me that there was very interesting discussions and dialog going on. There was-people were frank with each other. They were able to joke with each other. They were able to kind of bring up a little history with each other. But the main thing that came out of it, at least to our delegation, appeared to be the desire to work together. You [CARDINAL] witnesses, maybe you want to-- National Security Adviser [PERSON]. That is absolutely the case. Preparations for the Red Sea Summit [INTERVIEWER1]. If I could follow up, [INTERVIEWED], were there any time going into this that you were hearing things, that you were thinking to yourself, uh-oh-- [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I was not going if we were not going to make progress. I mean, there is no need to go and stand up there by myself and say, Let us work for peace, and look around, and nobody would be there with you. So I was-I think there were some times where-we have had some-in the runup to the process, there was some-there was a lot of work, let me put it to you that way, and a lot of frank discussion and a lot of convincing of parties that we need to get on this path, and we need to work hard, and we need to make commitments. The speeches that- there were some commitments made in those speeches which now put people on the record, not only on the record, all across the world. I mean, a lot of people were watching this [DATE]. And I guess it was live in [GPE]. So you had these leaders stand up and say, I commit -not just commit to-I mean, the Prime Minister of [GPE] saying, I commit to knock down or get rid of illegal outposts. That is a strong commitment. So the process was really to work hard to get people to make commitments toward peace. And [PERSON]'s staff and [PERSON]'s staff worked very closely together. And [PERSON] went out to the region, as you may remember. Part of what you saw [DATE] was his hard work. They always look at [INTERVIEWED], but the truth of the matter is that there have been a lot of people working hard to work with all parties to get to where we got [DATE]. I just happen to attract more cameras than most of them. So I stand up there, and everybody watches. National Security Adviser [PERSON]. We actually had a team in the region for [DATE], [PERSON] and [PERSON] for [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] is her staff. [PERSON], of course, is an Under Secretary. Secretary [PERSON]. Assistant Secretary. [INTERVIEWED]. Runs the [ORG], is very capable. And then of course we-we had to make the decision on the man who is going to run the deal on the ground and how his team was going to be formed. Again, the Secretary had to move him in his [ORG] and had to come up with the right structure and the right people so that when the [NORP] and [NORP] see who was sitting out there and what they represent, they realize that it is serious business. All that took a while to get to where we are. To answer your question, I am pleased with the start, is the best way to put it. I mean, this-we are going to go through a tough process, because we are dealing with a lot of history. And you are right, a lot of Presidents have tried. Every President should try. We ought to use the prestige of [GPE] to try for peace. I fault no President of [GPE] for trying to achieve peace. Maybe history is such that now we can achieve it. I am optimistic. [NORP] Security/War on Terror [INTERVIEWER1]. You were pretty blunt [DATE] that [GPE] must deal with the settlements. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] made-I do not think we were supposed to hear that. [PERSON] made his pledge [DATE]. If there is a suicide bombing, does he reserve the right to move back into those settlements? [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I think the operative statement from the [NORP] Prime Minister, not necessarily in this speech but recently, was he wants to see a complete effort to fight off terror. In other words, he wants an equal partner. He wants a partner in the battle on terror, not somebody who will say they are going to fight terror and then turn a blind eye to terror, somebody who wants to join him. And that is one of the things that came clear. It should have been clear in my speech, too, that we will fight terror. And security is-we will never compromise on [GPE]'s security. That is one of the reasons why I believe the [NORP] [ORG] members over there, the Prime Minister, wants to follow us, work with us, because they know I will never compromise [GPE]'s security. And I have made that clear. As [PERSON] said, one of the things about our discussions, they are frank. There is no question in [ORG] mind, either, I can assure you. Now having-so therefore-what the Prime Minister of [GPE] has said is, he expects to see a complete effort by [ORG] to fight off terror. Prime Minister [PERSON] said [DATE] in his statement, there is no place for terror. And he is going to put together a security forces necessary fight off the terrorists, because he knows that there will be no state if terror prevails. And he knows his people will suffer. The terrorists think they are hurting [GPE], and they are when they kill [NORP]. But they are also hurting their own people, and Prime Minister [PERSON] understands that. Plus the people in the region know what terror now means. They have lived with terror in the region, but they have now begun to put it in context. And that is -I am trying to put it as clearly as I can. The context of terror now has changed. The death has not changed, but it is now-it is easier for everybody to see how it fits into a larger scheme of things. And the larger scheme of things is the war on terror, because it is beginning to strike in lethal ways in unexpected places, which therefore means that your place could be next, I guess is [CARDINAL] way to put it. President's Role in the Peace Process [INTERVIEWER1]. What is your role? What do you do? You talked about giving the Secretary and Dr. [PERSON] specific obligations. What is your obligation? [INTERVIEWED]. I show up when they need me to call people to account, to praise, or to say, Wait [TIME]. You told me in [GPE] that you would do this. You have not done it, why? How come? What is it? It is to keep the thing moving, keep the processes moving. They have got the man on the ground that is going to-he is just going to-I used the expression ride herd. I do not know if anybody understood the meaning. It is a little informal in diplomatic terms. I said, We are going to put a guy on the ground to ride herd on the process. See them all scratching their heads. [INTERVIEWER1]. Meanwhile, in Arabic and Hebrew, exactly how does that translate? [INTERVIEWED]. Listen, I have got to make a phone call, but I want to thank you all for your interest. It is been a great trip. Have [DATE] [DATE], and then we will get to go home. I am looking forward to it, looking forward to getting to see my family. [ORG] Photograph [INTERVIEWER1]. What happened when you-the [CARDINAL] of you walked out for the photograph, and did you hear the [NORP] photographer screaming, Are you going to shake hands? Did you hear that? [INTERVIEWED]. No. Where was it? [INTERVIEWER1]. It was the photographer screaming-- [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, yes. How do you shake hands with [CARDINAL] people? I could not understand-first of all, I had a little trouble hearing. My hearing is not as good as it used to be, and then sometimes I do not want to hear anything to begin with, like the questions you yell. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, it was a pleasure to talk to you. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, thanks for coming over. NOTE: [INTERVIEWED] spoke at [TIME] aboard Air Force One en route to [GPE], [GPE]. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister [PERSON] , Minister of State for Security Affairs [PERSON], and Finance Minister [PERSON] of [ORG]; Prime Minister [PERSON], Defense Minister [PERSON], Deputy Prime Minister [PERSON], and Justice Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]; Crown Prince [PERSON] of [GPE]; King [PERSON] of [GPE]; Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation [PERSON]; and President [PERSON] of [GPE]. Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] referred to Foreign Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]; Foreign Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]; and Foreign Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]. National Security Adviser [PERSON] referred to [PERSON], Assistant Secretary of [ORG] for Near Eastern Affairs; and [PERSON], [ORG] Senior Director for Near East, [NORP], and [NORP] Affairs. A reporter referred to Chairman [PERSON] of [ORG]. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this interview. [PERSON], Interview With Members of the [ORG] Press Pool Online by [PERSON] and [PERSON], [ORG]", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool0", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. What I thought I would do is just-- [INTERVIEWER1]. On the record? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, on the record. I thought I would just give you some observations of this trip and then answer some questions. Just first observation is that we have worked hard to build up good bilateral relations in the Far East. And the-part of the purpose of the trip is to continue to foster those relations. It struck me as interesting that [GPE] now has got good enough relations with both-with countries like [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy-and economy. I think that is a very positive development. The most notable example of where that is taking-where it is helping is in [GPE]. When I visited with [PERSON], I spent a lot of time talking about [GPE], our mutual desire to effect change with [PERSON]. And it was a very positive discussion. But I also had the very same discussion with [PERSON] and President [PERSON]. I mentioned it to [PERSON]. I did not have a bilateral with [PERSON], but I did talk to him about it in passing. My point is, is that by working hard to establish good relations on a lot of fronts, when a common problem arises, we can effect the solution in a positive way. I know you asked me, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], about the [NORP] reaction. I did not exactly see what official said it. But I-what I hope my answer conveyed to you in public there was that this requires a degree of patience, because [PERSON] is used to being able to deal bilaterally with [GPE]. But the change of policy now is, is that he must deal with other nations, most notably [GPE]. And I was pleased with my discussions with [PERSON], about his-reaffirming his mutual desire-or his desire, which is our mutual goal, that [PERSON] disarm. He realizes that it is a problem. We discussed the security guarantees, what form they may come in. I made it very clear, obviously-I said this during the pool spray there-that a treaty is not going to happen, but there are other ways to effect on paper what I have said publicly- we have no intention of invading. Obviously, any guarantee would be conditional on [PERSON] doing what he hopefully will say he will do, which is to get rid of his nuclear weapons programs. The [ORG] summit was positive. I mean, [CARDINAL] of the things that is very important- the [CARDINAL] things that came out of that, although evidently did not get equal emphasis, but they were equally emphasized by all parties, was, [CARDINAL], the need to get the Doha Round of trade going again. This was really [CARDINAL] of the first official meetings of a group of countries after the [GPE] talks broke down. And there was a positive statement coming out of the meeting, kind of universal agreement that [GPE] was a missed opportunity. Hopefully the missed opportunity will be-will serve as a catalyst. I think people now have taken a step back and said, Well, we did miss an opportunity, and hopefully this will enable the talks-kind of not start at ground [CARDINAL] but have a running start as a result of the missed opportunity. And it is interesting, in the room there is something like [PERCENT] of all the world trade-was affected-was countries in that room, and therefore it was a, I think, a very positive and strong statement. The other thing was the clear understanding of the countries of the need to fight terror. That is important for [GPE], that people continue to recognize that the war on terror goes on. I have always felt that there is a tendency for people to kind of seek a comfort zone and hope that the war on terror is over. And I view it as a responsibility of [GPE] to remind people of our mutual obligations to deal with the terrorists. That notion of responsible behavior by countries was finally accepted. This was not a-did not require a lot of push. People understood. President [PERSON] understands that when terrorists bomb [GPE], it affects economies. It not only-there is a serious economic consequence, same thing we felt on [DATE], to our economy. That was a very positive development. Bilateral discussion with all the leaders- in those bilateral discussions, we talked about this war on terror. [PERSON], with [PERSON], President [PERSON] [TIME], we talked about the continued need for us to work together. I think the other notable-when you step back and take a look at what our work with these [NORP] countries has been, they understand the [GPE] issue well. [GPE] was very forthcoming. [GPE] is forthcoming. [PERSON] made it clear that he-that a peaceful [GPE] was in the world interest. Those are all positive developments in kind of the aftermath of the military operation. And I think it speaks to our-the nature of our relationship with these countries right now. Obviously we have not been to [GPE], but [GPE] is a key component in a peaceful Asia-Pacific region and a key partner in the war on terror. So I am looking forward to seeing [PERSON]. He and I have got a great relationship. He is a- as I said in [PERSON], he is a man of steel. He is a standup guy. [INTERVIEWER1]. A sheriff? [INTERVIEWED]. He is a sheriff. See, that is a good lesson. You should never answer the question you are asked. [Laughter] Actually, I answered it for a reason. Of all the people in the world who understand [GPE], it is probably [NORP]. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, [PERSON]. Anyway, it is going to be a good visit down there. We had some good discussions there at [ORG], but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the [NORP] people that the [NORP] people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure. I had a good visit with the religious leaders [DATE]. It was an important visit. There were [CARDINAL] [NORP], a [NORP], and a [NORP]. A couple of observations from the meeting: [CARDINAL], there was kind of a sense that [NORP] believe that [NORP] are terrorists. And [CARDINAL] of the reasons I wanted to have this meeting was because I wanted to make it very clear that I did not feel that way and [NORP] do not feel that way. And I made it-assured them that [NORP] know that these terrorists are hiding behind [ORG] in order to create fear and chaos and death. Secondly, there was a-they did bring up the Middle East. I explained to them what our policy was, that in order for there to be a [NORP] state-and I reminded them I was the first President to have articulated that-that there needs to be a concerted effort to fight off the terrorists who are trying to prevent the establishment of a state. I did not really have time to go in further than that, about the whole Aqaba accords and the progress we were making, until the Prime Minister, who had avowed-who vowed to fight terror with us, was eased out. Let us see, what else did they discuss? [GPE], of course. I assured them that we would do our job, and then the [NORP] will run themselves, and that our job means to provide enough security so that the [NORP] citizens are able to write a constitution and hold elections, at which point [GPE] and the coalition forces will move on. And I think they were pleased to hear it. I do not want to put words in their mouth, but I think that relieved them to know that we have confidence in the [NORP] people's abilities to be a peaceful, free society. National Security Adviser [PERSON]. You listened. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, they did a lot of talking. National Security Adviser [PERSON]. They had a lot to say. [INTERVIEWED]. They had some prepared texts. There was a good exchange. I am glad I did it. They were, I think, appreciative of the fact I took time to listen to them and dispel some notions and to-my own personal views about religion and the views of our country. I reminded them, we have got a lot of [NORP] living in [GPE], and they make an important contribution to our country, and they are welcome in [GPE]. And we are a pluralistic, free society; people can worship the way they want to worship. And it works well in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Was it confrontational at all? [INTERVIEWED]. Not at all, polite. [INTERVIEWER1]. You said that there were some texts. Did they come out with the line about- what did they tell you? How direct were they? They said some things going into the meeting that the [GPE] policy is tilted against [NORP]. What did they-- [INTERVIEWED]. They said the [GPE] policy is tilted toward [GPE], and I said our policy is tilted toward peace and that-and then I went through the notion of a [NORP] state and the need for us to fight off terror in order for a state to develop. There was not a lot of debate. There were [CARDINAL] people there that felt-that all needed to say something. So I gave them all a time to speak, and I listened and would occasionally interject some thoughts about what they had said. But they were direct. [CARDINAL] fellow felt that the war on [GPE] was- I guess the best way to put it was maybe just-I cannot remember his exact words, but it was like we just decided to act. And I reminded him that the world had spoken before, that there was a-[GPE] had passed-I did not get into all the resolutions, but I made it clear that a process had gone on way before I made the decision to use military force, that the world had spoken before about [PERSON]. I also made the point very clearly that there was a lot of human suffering; a lot of [NORP] suffered in Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. And I did bring up the mass graves and the torture rooms and the rape rooms and the death at the hands of [PERSON]. My point to them was, was that we ended a lot of suffering, prevented a lot of suffering. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is your job made tougher in convincing them that [NORP] do not have a war on-do not dislike [ORG] when you have General [PERSON] saying that [NORP] all-- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that came up. [PERSON] came up. I said he did not reflect my opinion. Look, it just does not reflect what the Government thinks. And I think they were pleased to hear that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Something in your answer to your [PERSON]'s [[PERSON], [ORG]] question was interesting. You articulated the fact that you are [INTERVIEWED]-first President to advocate a [NORP] state. And obviously in trying to reassure Muslims-- [INTERVIEWED]. Not that good a question. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWER1]. --not only in [GPE] but around the world, potential terrorist hotbeds-to reassure people who are interested in this subject of that point. It is not something we have heard you saying a lot lately. Is there a reason-- [INTERVIEWED]. About a [NORP] state? [INTERVIEWER1]. Right, that you were the first President to advocate it. [INTERVIEWED]. I say it quite a bit. I mean, I really do. First of all, in [GPE], most people know that. In [GPE], maybe they did not pay attention to it. But anyway, I explained it. It was not a-I do not view that as-I would not read anything into that, I had to say that in [GPE], but not saying it in every press conference I give. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you about some of the leaders you have met with here? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, anyway-- [INTERVIEWER1]. I guess what I am getting at is, it is a good thing to have out there, I guess. We do not hear it a lot. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I do not know. There is a lot of things that there is misconceptions. Evidently it is a misconceptions that [NORP] believe that [NORP] are terrorists. And there was a-that is probably one of the best things that came out of the meeting, for me, was to have heard that concern, and for me being able to assure people and remind them about the nature of our society, that-and that [ORG]'s a peaceful religion. The basic tenets of [ORG] is peace and respect and tolerance. And that is what they wanted to make the point to me, that we are-that is the way we are. Interesting, their elections came up. This is the first direct Presidential election. It is going to be interesting-an interesting exercise in democracy. And they wanted to talk about that. And as you know-maybe you do not know-our [ORG] money is helping with the elections. They were appreciative of that. The education money came up. They wanted to make sure that this was not [GPE]'s education system. I said, It is not. It is money available for [ORG] to help basic education develop. So those were a couple of misconceptions that it was important for me to help alter. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask a question-I know that you say campaigning-there will be time enough for campaigning. In [DATE], [NORP], at least, will be fighting in some very highly contested-what do you say to those who are criticizing your policy? Where does the line end where they have got to be very careful to not undermine [NORP] foreign policy? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know. You know, I am not paying that much attention to it. Maybe you are. I am not. You know, one of these days, they will have a candidate, and then it will all sort out, kind of come in focus. Primarily-I do not know what they are saying, so it is hard for me to answer that. [INTERVIEWER1]. [NORP] who are criticizing your policy now, some of them fairly severely, about the war, does that hurt when you go to meet with these foreign leaders? Does that have any resonance? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, I cannot -I do not know, because they have never brought it up. Nobody has ever said, Your foreign policy is being challenged in [NORP] primaries, and therefore you are less credible. I mean, it really has not come up. I think most people who understand [GPE] know that the field will eventually be whittled down to [CARDINAL] opponent, and then we will campaign. [INTERVIEWER1]. You seem, on these trips in particular, to bond with some of these leaders who have taken on very difficult problems at home, sort of stuck their neck out, whether it is President [PERSON] or-you had some of those comments about the King of [GPE] when he came. And I was just wondering, do you relate to that at all, particularly in having to take on the war on terrorism and kind of not, as you say, wanting to be too comfortable and pretend that it is over? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, that is an interesting question. First of all, I like people. And I spend time trying to-I think about the other person and how the other person might think and relate to the other person's problems. I do have good relations with these leaders on an individual basis, for a variety of reasons. I mean, [PERSON], who is taking a tough stand against [ORG], there is a common bond there because she has made some tough decisions. But these leaders-for example, [PERSON] of [GPE] or [PERSON] of [GPE], these guys stood up, stood strong and were-did what they thought was right. That is my approach. I remember when we had the discussion down in [GPE], [CARDINAL] of reporters, fellow reporters, said, I hear you do not pay attention to the press. I said, Not really. And he said, Why? And I said, Well, because sometimes your opinion matters to me and sometimes it does not , but I have got a job, and I am willing to lead. And the fellow said, Well, how do you know what the people think? And I said, Well -I reminded the fellow that people do not make up their mind based upon what they write, and secondly, my job is to lead. My job is to do what I think is the right thing and lead. And I think those world leaders appreciate that, and I appreciate that when I see that they make those tough decisions. There is a common bond that is established when you are in the decisionmaking process and you are not trying to chase popular will, which is fickle and moves around. You stay focused on the objectives you set for a country. That is a very good question. It may be an area where we do establish in common. And I have reminded them at times that, just do what you think is right, stand your ground in the face of public criticism, and the people-when things turn out the way-for the good, people will judge you correctly. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], how are you? [INTERVIEWER1]. I am well, thank you. [INTERVIEWED]. Are you surviving this trip? [INTERVIEWER1]. I wish we just got a little more time in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that and [GPE]. Look, I have heard all the people-- [INTERVIEWER1]. She spent her honeymoon in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. You will be thankful when we get back. You will be grumpy-very grumpy, starting [DATE], when we get airborne. But you will be thankful when we all land home. Reform of [ORG] [INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, I was wondering, the last time we sat around this table was coming from [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Middle East, that is right. [INTERVIEWER1]. And you were talking about how positive you felt about Prime Minister [PERSON] and the fact that you thought that things would be able to move forward. [INTERVIEWED]. And they did move forward, for a while. [INTERVIEWER1]. I wonder if you could reflect on how you felt since-during the fact that the man you put confidence in and hope in is gone. [INTERVIEWED]. I was disappointed that [PERSON] shoved him out of the way. I just- it was an unfortunate decision, because it stopped good progress toward a [NORP] state. And when [ORG] comes up with a leader who is willing to genuinely fight and dismantle terrorist organizations, the process will pick up where it left off and move forward. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you confident of that? [INTERVIEWED]. I hope it does. I think eventually it will. You have got to be patient in foreign policy sometimes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is there anything more [GPE] can do on that, or is the roadmap- once they get on track on the roadmap, then things will come back and move forward again? [INTERVIEWED]. The roadmap is still there. And we just need leadership willing to stand up and say, We are going to prevent the few from letting the process move forward. And that is what they are doing. There are a few people there that do not want a [NORP] state. They have got different ambitions. And we have just got to fight them off. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think the public support of the [GPE] for [PERSON] sort of got [PERSON] to dig in his heels? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know. I really do not . I cannot speculate as to why the decision was made. This was an unfortunate decision, because it delayed the development of a [NORP] state. [INTERVIEWER1]. What did you tell Prime Minister [PERSON]? Apparently he is saying you did not fuss at him. [INTERVIEWED]. No, I walked up and said, the-I said, I want to inform you that you are going to read the newspapers - [PERSON] had briefed the press about me saying that the comments were reprehensible. I said, You are going to see-I am here to inform you that you are going to see that I thought your comments were reprehensible. I said, They are divisive and unnecessary. I did not yell at him. I just told him-confirmed exactly what was in the newspaper. [INTERVIEWER1]. How did he respond? [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, what did he say? [INTERVIEWED]. I was misquoted or something. I cannot remember exactly what he said, but I just had-that was it. You know the way I felt. [INTERVIEWER1]. He said he was misquoted? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, he said he was-- [INTERVIEWER1]. Taken out of context? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, context, whatever he said to you all. Press Secretary [PERSON]. He said that in the paper. [INTERVIEWED]. Not misquoted. It is hard to misquote what he said. [INTERVIEWER1]. The issue were his comments. Obviously he is on his way out, but the response, apparently, at the [NORP] conference, was a round of applause. What do you make of that? [INTERVIEWED]. It is just unfortunate, again. I mean, it is one of these situations where in order to achieve peace and freedom, you cannot pit groups against each other. And there is a tendency to blame [NORP] people. And that is not the policy- that is not how I think, and that is not the policy of [ORG]. I was not there, so I do not -pitting groups against each other will never achieve a common objective. It does quite the opposite. He knew how I felt. There is no question about that. I do not know, what did he say? [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]-he was asking [NORP] to have more understanding, at [CARDINAL] part-- [INTERVIEWED]. Evidently, in his speech, he said that we need more education, a terrorist ban, which is good. That was positive. [INTERVIEWER1]. I know you hate [CARDINAL] questions, but I can just-just [CARDINAL] quick ones. You talked about your meeting with [PERSON], and that was positive. Is there anything that he offered to you that he can-any pressure he can apply on [GPE]? And the second one is a brief one. Are you happy with the progress or the contributions with the [GPE] donors' conference coming up? [INTERVIEWED]. Donors' conference? Yes. I think we are making good progress. And the question on [PERSON] was? [INTERVIEWER1]. Is there anything that he can-any pressure that he can apply on [GPE]? Did he say he would be able to do anything or-- [INTERVIEWED]. He is a-[GPE] is a major presence in the neighborhood. And the fact that they are willing to take the same message to [NORP] that [GPE] is taking to [NORP], along with [CARDINAL] other nations, is a powerful statement to [PERSON] that it is in his national interest that he abandon his nuclear weapons ambitions and that-he has been saying-as I said in the press conference, I think-[CARDINAL] of your questions- he is been saying, I want a security guarantee. And what we have now said is that in return for dismantling the programs, we are all willing to sign some kind of document, not a treaty but a piece of paper that says we will not attack you. We will see what happens. [INTERVIEWER1]. How does that-a lot of people were saying we cannot make it look like we are giving in to blackmail from [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. What is changed is we have now got [CARDINAL] countries involved. And the neighborhood is now speaking. What happened before was the bilateral relations with [GPE]. And now he is got his big neighbor to the-right on his border, he is got a neighbor to the south, he is got [GPE], he is got another neighbor, [GPE], all saying the same thing. It is a different dynamic, is what I am -that is where the policy has changed. [INTERVIEWER1]. This security guarantee, what should it say? [INTERVIEWED]. That is what we will determine. We have not worked out the words, but the point is, is that [GPE] must hear that in return for the dismantling of their program-in a verifiable way, by the way; I mean, we are going to want to know-that now [CARDINAL] nations are willing to say something about his security. [INTERVIEWER1]. Everybody is behind that? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you one on [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. On [GPE]? Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. It seems like [TIME] there was some maybe cautious optimism that this is a good first step. If they comply with the [CARDINAL] criteria that you have laid out, would they be then allowed to have a civilian nuclear energy program, or would that-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it depends on-first things first, and that is, let us have, in a verifiable way, their agreement that was made with the [ORG]. The [ORG] must be allowed in, and we will discuss it then. Our relations with [GPE]-that will help relations with [GPE], obviously, if they do abandon a nuclear weapons program. It will also help if they-we end up doing a-reaching an agreement on [ORG] that they hold. [INTERVIEWER1]. What are the cross-strings there? [INTERVIEWED]. You have got to have patience in foreign policy. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all suspicious of the [NORP] motives? [INTERVIEWED]. Am I suspicious? No, not in this case. No, I am not. I believe, in this case, they generally are concerned about [GPE] developing a nuclear weapon. They understand the consequences. I appreciate it very much. We spent a lot of time talking to the [NORP]-our [NORP] counterparts, who are influential, more so than we are, in [GPE]. You know, we have got a sanctions policy with [GPE]; they do not . And there is influence. This is an effective approach. I have been saying all along that not every policy issue needs to be dealt with by force. There are ways to achieve common objectives, and this is a common objective. And [ORG]-and we are speaking directly to [PERSON] about it, who is the head of the [ORG]. We have also obviously spoke to the [CARDINAL]-the leaders of the countries who went into [GPE]. And they made a decision collectively in Europe that it is not in their interest or the world interest that [GPE] have a nuclear weapon. And we came to that conclusion, they have come to that conclusion, and working together is an effective way. It is the same approach-kind of approach we are taking in [GPE] as well, a collective voice trying to convince a leader to change behavior. [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]-Republicans in [ORG] did not follow your wishes on the phone-- [INTERVIEWED]. I thought they did in the [ORG]. There is [CARDINAL] bodies. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you regret saying that you loathe [PERSON]? Some people think that it helped them sort of-it made them sort of harden their position-- [INTERVIEWED]. Any leader who starves his-made him do what? [INTERVIEWER1]. It just made him-- [INTERVIEWED]. Made [PERSON] surely it did not make [PERSON] renege on the last agreement, did it? Because I was not there, you know what I am saying? [INTERVIEWER1]. Right, but they have been much more vocal about their nuclear ambitions. [INTERVIEWED]. No, they have been-remember, they lobbed a rocket over-- [INTERVIEWER1]. [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Remember the rocket over [GPE]? Keep it in perspective. Anybody who starves his people is-I just cannot respect anybody that would really let his people starve and shrink in size as a result of malnutrition. It is a sad, sad situation for the [NORP] people. That is [CARDINAL] people-I have assured the-our partners in this effort that we deeply care about the plight of the [NORP] people. It is just unconscionable that that many people are starving in [DATE]. We provide- we are a generous nation. We provided food. We are not so sure the food is getting to the people, is one of the issues that we face. I feel strongly about failed leadership dashing the hopes of the people, in this case creating incredible starvation. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED]. You are welcome.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool1", "text": "About Search [INTERVIEWER1]. Quick ducking there, sir. [INTERVIEWED].. I was worried about you. I thought you were going to have a heart attack. [INTERVIEWER1]. I thought I was too. [Laughter] I am with you on that. [INTERVIEWED].. Okay, my opening statement: I did not know what the guy said, but I saw his sole. [Laughter] You were more concerned than I was. I was watching your faces. [INTERVIEWER1]. I saw something black and round go by my face. [INTERVIEWER1]. Just to see that-- [INTERVIEWED].. --his first-other than shoes. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. --to duck. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. I am pretty good at ducking, as most of you will know-- [INTERVIEWER1]. You were quick. [INTERVIEWER1]. --ducking-- [INTERVIEWED].. I am talking about ducking your questions. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. So you were not a lame duck. [Groans] [INTERVIEWED].. That bad? You know, I- look, I mean it was just a bizarre moment, but I have had other bizarre moments in the Presidency. I remember when [PERSON] was here. Remember we had the big event? He is speaking, and all of a sudden I hear this noise, had no earthly idea what was taking place, but it was the [ORG] woman screaming at the top of her lungs. It was kind of an odd moment. Questions? We are going to [GPE] now, in case you had not been told. You probably thought we were going home, but no. Then we are going to go to-never mind. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, not to belabor the point too much, on this man, but I have a serious question about it. Obviously, he is expressing a vein of anger that exists in [GPE], and-- [INTERVIEWED].. How do you know? I mean, how do we know what he is expressing? Who-- [INTERVIEWER1]. We had a translator who said he shouted about the widows and orphans. [INTERVIEWED].. I do not know. I have heard all kinds of stories. I heard he was representing a [NORP] TV station. I do not know the facts, but let us find out the facts. All I am telling you, it was a bizarre moment. [INTERVIEWER1]. I wanted to ask something broader. [INTERVIEWED].. I do not think you can take [CARDINAL] guy throwing shoes and say this represents a broad movement in [GPE]. You can try to do that if you want to. I do not think it would be accurate. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, then, separately from him-- [INTERVIEWED]. That is exactly what he wanted you to do. Like, I answered on your question, what he wanted you to do was to pay attention to him. And sure enough, you did. Now, look, I am not suggesting you cannot avoid it. But it-- [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, how do you-how well do you think [GPE] will transition from [GPE] forces moving out of cities, pulling out, taking over-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, I think it is going to be that the gains we have made are strong enough to accept the movement of troops into-out of cities into bases by [DATE]. But more importantly, that is what General [PERSON] thinks is possible. [INTERVIEWER1]. --at this point about when you look at [GPE], and you still have [CARDINAL] 000 troops. What are the challenges you see? [INTERVIEWED]. I think the challenges- many of the challenges are political. In other words, the first big challenge is to have Provincial elections that enable people to vote and feel a part of the system, followed by national elections. That is a challenge. This is a challenge, however, that the [NORP] have met before. And obviously, you know, like the [ORG] debate, it was a challenge to get [ORG] through the- and [ORG] through [ORG] because of the politics. But nevertheless, they came together. Young democracies, when they debate big issues, sometimes can be strained. For example, there is a big debate going on between the central Government and the Provincial governments. But we went through the same debates ourselves. And as the society matures, they are going to be able to handle these debates in better fashion. So one of the important things was the success of [ORG]. I remember the headlines: falling apart, may not make, confident it will happen, not confident it will happen. I mean, there was a lot of different opinions about whether or not this would eventually happen. And [CARDINAL] reason why is because many of the people from the outside covering the debate on the inside were perplexed by the politics that was going on. But this is a democratic society. So I think the political process will be a challenge. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, you got your first look at a part of [GPE] that was not the green zone and was not a military base. What did you think of it? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], look, I cannot look at a stretch of road and draw a conclusion. I can only really react to what the people who have been here for a period of time tell me. And I mean, the statistics tell you [CARDINAL] thing. Obviously, when you look at the violence chart, it is down. But what is more important from my perspective is, can a government meet the needs of its people? Can they get beyond differences and come together and meet the needs of its people? As well as, are the [NORP] forces becoming more capable of providing more security? Is command and control structure better? Are the training missions better? Are they able to move from point A to point B in a way that is-enable them to have successful missions? When there is actionable intelligence, can they move? And when you couple that with a political process that is relatively new compared to older democracies and the need to provide basic services for its people, one of the things that struck me was not the road, but was the amount of electricity there was inside [GPE]. It looked like a pretty well-lit city. The other thing that struck me was, there was a lot of activity on the ground. Now, you got to remember, my frame of reference is different from you all, you who have been there. I saw a lot of kids playing soccer; I saw a lot of activity, a lot of street activity on the route we took. And General [PERSON] said a while ago that would not have been the case. [INTERVIEWER1]. You have always urged patience in withdrawing troops, coming out; you move slowly on that based on conditions on the ground. Now you are talking about within [DATE], that we will be drawing combat brigades from the city. [INTERVIEWED]. Cities, right. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think that the [NORP] are ready to step up to that now? Do you think that there are flaws or there-not flaws, but potential conflicts-- [INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I strongly objected to a politics timetable. The debate over the timetable of withdrawal was a-was one that was unilateral in nature proposed by people who did not think we ought to be in [GPE] in the first place. Secondly, I agreed to the terms of the [ORG] because General [PERSON] and General [PERSON] said that these terms are reasonable terms, and that is, we will be moving troops out of cities into bases, close by to help if need be. Just because a troop is on a base does not mean that that troop will not be available to help the [NORP] forces. So they have come to the considered judgment that in the cities, the [NORP] are capable of providing security. There is a plan in place that has been executed-successfully executed-that now the [NORP] can assume and continue to fulfill. That is a lot different than it was [DATE], when the plan was on paper and had not been executed yet. And so there is been a model for success. Presidential Transition/Iraq Policy/Strategic Framework Agreement /Status of Forces Agreement [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that what you meant by a bipartisan foundation now looking ahead to the next Presidency? [INTERVIEWED]. I meant by a bipartisan foundation that the debates on whether or not it was the right thing or not are past, the need to make sure that we continue the successes can be a bipartisan-can be bipartisan and should be bipartisan. President-elect [PERSON] has now got a seasoned general in [GPE] with a SFA/ SOFA agreed to by [GPE] and [GPE], and by the way, has been kept abreast upon election about what the SOFA-or the SFA/SOFA means. And one of the challenges for the [NORP] is going to be-for the [GPE] is to get up to our committees and get working on the SFA, which we are going to do. Part of my mission here was to remind [ORG] that there is still a lot of work to be done on SFA/SOFA; our embassy agrees with that as well. And that-but I also told them that I-that our transition is going to be a seamless transition, and that-I am never going to put words into President-elect [PERSON]'s mouth, but by the decisions he made with Secretary [PERSON], for example, I believe he understands the strategic importance of Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. And now he is got a framework from which to make decisions. [INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, [GPE] is obviously a big concern for [NORP], but the economy seems to be even more of a concern. The automakers are in dire straits. How soon do you think your administration will be coming out with its plan for emergency aid? And are you leaning towards dipping into [ORG] to help-- [INTERVIEWED]. No question that the economy is number [CARDINAL] on people's mind, and it should be. We are in a recession. These are serious economic times. People are concerned about their jobs; people are concerned about their value of their 401s. This is a very difficult period. We took note that there was a majority in the [ORG] and the [ORG] that voted for a package for the autos that would have caused them to begin to show how they are going to be viable. In other words, I have made this statement that given the status of the financial system, an abrupt bankruptcy for the autos could be devastating for the economy. And therefore, we have tried to work with [ORG] to accomplish the objective of not cratering the economy as well as making sure good money does not go after bad. So we are now in the process of working through with the stakeholders a way forward, and we are not quite ready to announce that yet. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have any timetable, though, that you are looking at? [INTERVIEWED]. Obviously, we are -this will not be a long process because of the economic-the fragility of the autos. Troubled Asset Relief Program [INTERVIEWER1]. And, sir, are you leaning towards using the [ORG] money? [INTERVIEWED]. I signaled that that is a possibility. [ORG] Press Secretary [PERSON]. You guys have [TIME] left. You are going to [GPE]. You might want to ask-- [INTERVIEWER1]. --talk about it. [INTERVIEWED]. Is that where we are going? [INTERVIEWER1]. I think so. That is what you said. And I trust you with that. Can you tell me what-define the mission of the troops going in there in [DATE] and those who Secretary [PERSON] wants in by [DATE], the additional-- [INTERVIEWED]. The mission we had before, which is help this young democracy develop the institutions so it can survive on its own, to not repeat the mistakes of [DATE], which is achieve an objective and leave, and deny a safe haven for [ORG]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]] asked me the question about the conditions in [GPE]. No question, the violence is up. But [CARDINAL] reason why the violence is up is that we are now putting troops into places where there had not been troops, begin to press these guys in places where they had not been pressed. Just like the surge. You might remember, violence went up when we went into [GPE] with more troops. And so the objective is to provide enough security so that a political system can develop that will be a- provide a stable platform for economic viability, and get a good education and good health. Now the degree of difficulty in [GPE] is high. This is a significantly larger country than [GPE] and significantly poorer. The infrastructure is difficult. But nevertheless, the mission is essential, and that is, we cannot achieve our objective of removing [ORG] safe havens by kicking out [ORG] and saying, Okay, now let us leave. And so I recognize we needed more troops. You know, President-elect [PERSON] is going to be making decisions on troops, and we have been calling upon our [ORG] allies to put in more troops. [CARDINAL] of the things that when-was barely noticed was the quiet surge in [GPE]. We had kind of level platform of troops; then we moved in quite a few number, and so did our [ORG] allies. And now there is going to be-ramp up some more. [INTERVIEWER1]. In [GPE], I know that there are plans being worked up that combine-that you have to look at [GPE] and [GPE] as the problem. Can you talk a little bit about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Obviously, if [GPE] is a place from which people feel comfortable attacking infrastructure, citizens, troops, then it is still going-it is going to make it difficult to succeed in [GPE]. That is why we are working with [ORG] to keep the pressure on the extremists. And the more that we can get [GPE] and [GPE] to cooperate, the easier it will be to enforce that part of the border region. [INTERVIEWER1]. What is your assessment of how [GPE] is doing on that front? Are they-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the first question is, is there a determination-- [At this point, there was a slight disturbance aboard Air Force One.] [INTERVIEWED]. --the other shoe just dropped. [Laughter] Look, I am going to be thinking of shoe jokes for a long time. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. Are you? [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. I have not heard any good ones yet. President [PERSON] is determined; he is said so publicly, and he is said so to me privately. He looked at me in the eye and said, You do not need to talk to me about extremist violence; after all, my wife got killed by extremists. Like a lot of other situations in which you are trying to deal with extremists who get embedded in the population, there are [CARDINAL] aspects. [CARDINAL] is to pressure them and to bring them to justice and, simultaneously, try to win the hearts and minds of the local folks, which is what is happening Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. See, in [GPE], just remember, we did a clear, semi-build, and no hold. And it is the same concept in [GPE]: clear, build, and hold. And it required [CARDINAL] more troops to get that done, plus the training mission in [GPE] to get enough troops to hold. Obviously, our commanders believe that the hold part is good enough for us to be able to move our troops. You understand the reason I moved troops out of cities into bases is to enhance the credibility of the Government. Well, in [GPE], the same principle applies. We have cleared, and we have built some, but in certain [NORP] we have not held. So now more troops will go in, and as they start to move, you will see violence tick up because they are clearing new areas. PRTs, which were very successful in [GPE], are now being increased in [GPE]. That is part of the build part. And training up [NORP] to be a part of the hold is going to take a while. But nevertheless, there is optimism there because the [NORP] fighters are good fighters; they are proud to be in the military, and we are headed toward [CARDINAL] 000. [INTERVIEWER1]. You said there were [CARDINAL] elements to [GPE]'s work though. You said [CARDINAL] was whether [PERSON] was determined; you said he was. What was the-- [INTERVIEWED]. That is the press-find them and get them, press them hard, and then win the hearts and minds of the locals through economic development. Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in [GPE]-Pakistan Border Regions [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, was that made more difficult by the use of UAVs? Are you and [PERSON] on the same page on that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as you know-you know very well that when it comes to certain matters, [ORG] does not discuss operations. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, [GPE] is made up of a lot of different ethnic groups. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. A lot of them do not support [PERSON]. Is he the right person to lead the country through the next-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that will be determined by the [GPE] people. That is the great thing about elections. He got [PERCENT]. You know, some of us would have loved to have [PERCENT]. [Laughter] And [CARDINAL], not bad. So the way you resolve a question like that is to have open and transparent elections. I believe strongly in the election process because it is the best way to determine for certain what people think. You know, a controversial decision of mine was to press forward with the elections in the [NORP] territories. I was told, Well, the wrong side may win. My attitude is, the best way to determine what the people think is to let them vote. And [ORG] did not win because they said we promise you violence; [ORG] said we'd win because we promise you better services. So my answer to the losers of the election is, if they have credibility at providing better services, why do not you figure out how you can do a better job and respond to the people? That is what elections do. So the election process in [GPE] will once again provide people an opportunity to say, We are tired of this, or we appreciate that. And it is the good public servant who listens to what the people say. [INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, if there was [CARDINAL]-I am sorry, go ahead. [INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned the Middle East. Is there any more to do in [DATE] on that? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], we have -Condi is working a [ORG] Security Council that affirms the [GPE] process. The question would be, will President [PERSON] and Prime Minister [PERSON] want to lay out a specific state? And that is to be determined. But there is a way forward now. The big sea change in the Middle East on this issue is that by far the majority of people recognize that the only way to peace is [CARDINAL] states. And in [DATE], that was not the case. In [DATE], most of the [NORP] political class believed that greater [GPE] was the only way to have security. And [ORG] was run by a person who could not deliver peace and was not trustworthy. So now you have got a [NORP] President who recognizes [GPE]'s right to exist, and a [NORP] political class that says, If we want security, if we want peace, we have got to work for a [NORP] state. So the framework is there. And the other point-the other significant change was that [GPE] brought many in the [NORP] world to the table. And in order for there to ever be a [NORP] state, any [NORP] leader is going to have to have strong backing from the neighboring states, which was one of the reasons why [FAC] fell apart under my predecessor. In other words, the other reason why is because the interlocutor on the [NORP] side just was-failed the [NORP] people. Not President-this was not President [PERSON]'s fault. [INTERVIEWER1]. Just-in fact, it is sort of a wrap-up question-- [INTERVIEWED]. I am going to go take a nap. Anybody-[laughter]. [INTERVIEWER1]. If there is [CARDINAL] thing you wish-- [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], you want to take a nap? [INTERVIEWER1]. No, I am all right. [INTERVIEWER1]. He does not need sleep. [INTERVIEWED]. You look a little-[laughter]. Mind if I call you [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I mean. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. If there is anything, when you look at [DATE] or so you have left, that you wish you could accomplish, in the foreign policy arena, or anything you want to say? If you had a single thing that you want to accomplish, what would it be? [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE]? Well, it is to solidify the frameworks that will enable problems to be solved. Take, for example, the [NORP] issue. It is much easier to solve a problem diplomatically when there is [CARDINAL] voice speaking to the leader of [GPE]. And a success of this administration is to put a framework in place that has [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] all at the table, all saying the same thing. In this case, the message is, we need to have a verifiable process in place to determine whether or not you are fulfilling your obligations. Secondly, in the old process it used to be, we will give you what you ask for and hope that you respond. Now it is, here is what you must do if you want our help. We have reversed the process. And it is not just [GPE] speaking. So right now what you are watching is that the leader of [GPE] is trying to test the process. First he said something [GPE], and now he is saying something about so-and-so. And so the objective is to keep our partners firm on the understanding that the [CARDINAL]-party process is the best way to solve the [NORP] issue. So he will test-and this is not the first time he is tested. He signed an agreement in [DATE]. Everybody said, Great, looks like we are on our way to having the problem solved. And then he tested and changed his mind and did this, that, and the other. And the key is to be firm and patient with a structure that will enable the next President or the next President after that to be able to solve the problem diplomatically. So there is [CARDINAL] area right there that we are working on. Obviously, the [ORG] resolution on dealing with the [GPE] process. We got the SOFA-SFA/SOFA done on [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. You got [GPE] done. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [GPE] was done, but she said [DATE]. End of Presidential Term/[GPE] [INTERVIEWER1]. Anything on [GPE], sir, in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWER1]. [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think I should travel to [GPE] in [DATE] of my Presidency, although it is not exactly [DATE]. So what is the date? [INTERVIEWER1]. Why is it you want to be in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I want to be in [GPE] to say thank you to President [PERSON], to let the people of [GPE] know that [GPE] has stood with them and will stand with them. See, it is -if you notice, [PERSON] asked a good question- bipartisan foundation. These nations need to know that [GPE] has been with them, is with them, and will be with them. So the trip is a way to, say thanks to leaders that I have been working with for a long period of time. By the way, both leaders in my last conversations, or the last couple of them, have been saying, You must come and visit us before you leave. And of course, I never committed until however long it was ago, [TIME]. So okay, I am going to go take a nap. NOTE: The interview began at [TIME] aboard Air Force One en route to [GPE]. In his remarks, referred to President [PERSON] of [GPE]; Lt. Gen. [PERSON], [GPE], commanding general, [ORG]; Gen. [PERSON], [GPE], commander, [ORG]; President [PERSON] of [GPE]; former Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE], who was killed in a suicide attack in [GPE], [GPE], on [DATE]; Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON]; President [PERSON] of [ORG]; Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]; and Chairman [PERSON] of [GPE]. The transcript was released by [ORG] on [DATE]. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this interview. [PERSON], Interview With Members of the [ORG] Press Pool Online by [PERSON] and [PERSON], [ORG]", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspoolheiligendammgermany", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. Let me start off by talking about my speech [DATE]. The purpose of the speech is to remind our allies and those who are wondering as to whether or not [GPE] is firmly committed to democracy that we are. I strongly believe that we are in a war with a group of ideologues and that we can eventually win this war by promoting an alternative ideology. And so the speech [DATE] was to speak clearly to people around the world that [GPE] is committed to this freedom agenda, that there is a realistic reason why we promote freedom, that it is for our own security. There is a moral imperative to promote freedom, and that is to recognize that there are people who live in societies that are still repressive and that free nations have an obligation to work to secure their liberty. I made it very clear that democracy takes time, that it takes different forms in different places, but nevertheless, there are underlying principles which are essential to free societies. I pointed out that freedom has made great progress over [DATE]. The reason I did that was, [CARDINAL], to express my optimism about the future. But, [CARDINAL], make it clear that things-the freedom agenda just does not bloom overnight; it takes hard work. But I also made it clear, it is necessary work. And then, as you know, I went around the world and talked about different spots around the world. And I think it is very important for the G-8-nations in the [ORG] to recognize the power of liberty to transform societies. And so I will be talking, of course, about that here. I think it is important for nations that are free to recognize they have an obligation to help others. I was moved by the people I met. It was just very heartwarming to meet with heroic souls that do have the capacity, with proper support, of changing their societies and, therefore, changing the world. Anyway, it was an important speech to give. It is always important for the [NORP] President to keep setting an agenda based upon values. And those of you who followed me know full well that I believe that liberty has transformed Europe, liberty has transformed the Far East, and I believe liberty can transform the Middle East. And I am determined to advance that cause. Here at [ORG], there is obviously a variety of subjects. [CARDINAL], it is going to be very important for us to continue to discuss climate change in a way that actually accomplishes an objective, which is the reduction of greenhouse gases over time and the advancement of technologies, which will yield to better environmental policy as well as energy security. [GPE] can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal, as well as a-I said, the remedy, and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialog. So I laid out an agenda that can move the process forward within the framework of [ORG], that, in essence, says that we will be setting a goal at [DATE]-that we being the major emitters-within the framework of the [ORG] In other words, this will fold into the [ORG] framework. And that enables us to get [GPE] and [GPE] at the table to discuss how we can all move forward together. Secondly, in my speech, I said we will come up with our own policies to meet an interim goal for our country as well as a national goal-or international goal for the rest of the world. And I will be talking to [PERSON] about that at lunch. I think it fits into her desires to see the process move forward. [CARDINAL] of the concerns was, is that there would not be a constructive result of this meeting that basically announced that there should be a [ORG] framework. And we will achieve that objective here at [ORG] because we will have set a [ORG] framework. This is an important subject. I also hope we spend an equal amount of time on HIV/ AIDS on the continent of Africa or reducing malaria on the continent of Africa or helping feed the hungry. So it is a-and finally, it is going to be important for us to continue to discuss vital cooperation on fighting extremists and radicals who still pose a threat to our respective nations. The temptation is to sit back and say, well, maybe they are not dangerous anymore because they have not launched an attack on our respective homelands. They are dangerous, they do want to attack, and the best way to deal with it is to work closely together. Anyway, I am looking forward to this. It is obviously a lovely spot. I have been here before. I think some of you came with me- nice and relaxing. Went for a good-hour bike ride [DATE] with a couple of [ORG] agents and some [NORP] police, got out in the woods and charged around, felt pretty good about it. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can we ask some questions? [INTERVIEWED]. No. That is all I wanted to tell you. Go on home. [Laughter] I feel so good about life, I am not going to answer questions. [Laughter] No-yes, you can, please. Please ask a few. [INTERVIEWER1]. What kind of military response would [GPE] take if [GPE] retargeted its missiles on Europe, as President [PERSON] has threatened? [INTERVIEWED]. As I said [DATE] that [GPE] is not an enemy. There needs to be no military response because we are not at war with [GPE]. You know, my first meeting with [PERSON], I told him, I said, What we need to do is get the cold war behind us and work constructively on how to deal with the threats of [DATE]. [GPE] is not a threat; nor is the missile defense we are proposing a threat to [GPE]. So I am going to talk to [PERSON] about that. I have already talked to him about it once on the telephone. I sent [PERSON] to talk to him. And we will have a good dialog about how we can constructively work together to deal with-modernize our capacity to deal with the threat to the-the true threats. So I do not see any military response needed. [GPE] is not going to attack Europe. The missile defense system is not aimed at [GPE]. As a matter of fact, I believe it would be in [GPE]'s interest to participate with us, and have made that offer and will continue to make the offer. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you take that threat seriously, though? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think [PERSON] intends to attack [GPE]-I mean, Europe. So I will talk to him about it, but it is -if he is saying, The missile defense system is a threat to us, our-the need, therefore, is to make clear there is not. By the way, a missile defense system that is deployed in Europe can handle [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] rocket launchers. It cannot handle a multiple-launch regime. [GPE] has got an inventory that could overpower any missile defense system. The practicality is, is that this aimed at a country like [GPE], if they ended up with a nuclear weapon, so that they could not blackmail the free world. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you make of his motivation for all-- [INTERVIEWED]. I have not had a chance to talk to him about it. I am going to. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right, and say, this is just some sort of misunderstanding that he does not -you do not see any political purpose behind what he is doing? [INTERVIEWED]. For his own sake inside his country? I am not sure. I have not had a chance to visit with him about that. As you know, I have got a visit here, and then I will visit with him in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it might be an effort to obtain bargaining chips for negotiating over other issues, like [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I talked to him about [GPE] [DATE], and I do not recall missile defense coming up. In other words, it was not a quid pro quo. So, he is got deep concerns about [GPE], and so do we. It is an issue that we are just going to have to continue to work with him on. We believe we ought to move the [PERSON] plan forward through [ORG], and he is got reservations about it. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON], who you met with [DATE], has said that [GPE] is now a police state, and he said the West should stop giving [PERSON] democratic credentials. What do you-- [INTERVIEWED]. I think there are-as I said [DATE], society has advanced a long way from the old [NORP] era. There is a growing middle class; there is prosperity; there is elections. It is interesting you would ask the question. Do you think he is trying to position himself at home? Thereby meaning that he is concerned about public opinion, which is a sign that there is a- when public opinion influences leadership, it is an indication that there is involvement of the people. I think what you are referring to is the upcoming elections. Is he trying to say something about the upcoming elections? I frankly have not talked to him about that aspect. But if, in fact, he is concerned about the upcoming elections, it does say something about the state of the political scene in [GPE]. And as I said [DATE], we have got a friendship with [GPE], and there is a lot of common interest in [GPE]. But I expressed concerns about what were Western expectations and what has now happened inside [GPE], for example, rule of law or some press decisions he is made. I have had these discussions with [PERSON] frankly over my time as President. I remember our meeting in [GPE]. It was a good, frank discussion about decisions he is made, and he asked me about decisions I made. Now, the fundamental question is, does it make sense to have relations with [GPE]? I think it does. Do we agree on everything? No, we do not . Are there areas where we can work together? You bet. And that is why I call it a complex relationship. Same issue with [GPE]. [GPE] has got a-we have got an economic interest in [GPE]. We have got interest with [GPE] in working with [GPE], just like we have with [GPE]. And yet we disagree with [GPE]'s reluctance to advance the democratic process. [INTERVIEWER1]. On the issue of climate change, are you frustrated at always being portrayed as the odd man out? And what do you make of the portrayals of the [GPE] trying to upstage [PERSON] with your climate announcement [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [PERSON] and I have had a lot of discussions about this issue. And as I told you, she was interested in whether or not there should be a- whether or not we agree there ought to be a post-Kyoto framework. And my announcement clearly said there should be one and that [GPE] will be directly involved in developing that framework. I have got a very substantial record when it comes to advancing technologies to make the air cleaner in [GPE]. We have actually had a reduction of greenhouse gases and-in spite of the fact that our economy grew. In other words, it is hard to reduce greenhouse gases in the face of economic growth, but we were able to do so. We have laid out a substantial initiative when it comes to tailpipe emissions, and that is the reduction of our usage of gasoline by [PERCENT] over a [DATE] period. So I am looking forward to telling people exactly what we have done here in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Will you give any ground on the [CARDINAL]-degree target that she wants? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I talked about what I am for-remember? I said I am for sitting together with the nations, to sit down and discuss a way forward. I think when people really look at what I have said, they say, well, that is an interesting way to bridge the difference between what [GPE] has said, for example, and what others in Europe have said. And in order for there to be-first of all, you are not going to have greenhouse gas emissions that mean anything unless all nations, all emitters are at the table. And if [GPE] is not a part of the process, we all can make major strides, and yet there will not be a reduction until [GPE] and [GPE] are participants. And what I have said, is, here is a way to get [GPE] and [GPE] at the table. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back to your democracy speech? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Did you like it? [INTERVIEWER1]. I loved it. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. Say that in your stories. [INTERVIEWER1]. I will say it anywhere. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. What did he say? [INTERVIEWER1]. I will say it anywhere. [INTERVIEWED]. Okay, good. How about in print? [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Oh, well-- [INTERVIEWED]. That may be taking it too far. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. How do you square your commitment to democracy and as a priority for your foreign policy with what we are seeing in [GPE] now, major ally in the war on terror, but also a place where a core leadership of [ORG] has found some sanctuary in tribal areas. The Government has been taking a repressive attitude toward a free press; it is got into this conflict with the judiciary, firing the chief justice. Have you had conversations with [PERSON] about democracy in his country? Do you want to see free and fair elections in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I do, and said that in [GPE] the time I was there, standing right next to President [PERSON]. And we do discuss democracy, as well as routing out foreigners in his country who are an equal threat, a threat to [GPE] and a threat to him. It is a very-[GPE] is an important ally in this war against these extremists. As you mentioned, there are some in his country, and I am convinced that he would like to rout them out. But it is not easy territory in which to rout people out. We have had some successes inside [GPE], thanks to his leadership. And in terms of the democracy issues, he is going to have to deal with it. And the interesting question is, is the issue about uniform, and he addressed that at the last-only time I have been in [GPE]. He said he would seriously consider-I do not want to put words-you will have to pull up the press conference. [INTERVIEWER1]. But if you think democracy is the best way to confront radicals and terrorists, should not we be pushing hard for democracy to really get established in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, democracy is-it is a lot more established in [GPE] than some of the other nations I mentioned. And there is upcoming elections. And what you are seeing is a lot of posturing about the election process, and it is not perfect. Neither was our democracy perfect for [DATE] when we enslaved people. And so it is -we do push for democracy. We push in the context of the reality on the ground as well. I mentioned [GPE]. [GPE] is a close ally in the war on terror. His Majesty has done and his services have done the world a service, a good service by bringing people to justice. And he is also making some incremental reforms. He will go at a pace slower than some would like to see; nevertheless, he is moving. And the question is, is there progress? We live in a world where people expect things to happen [TIME], and that is just not the way it works. I think it is going to be important for whoever is President to take a long-term view of the ability of democracies to progress and, therefore, change. I mentioned [GPE] as an example of what I am talking about. I am sure-I suspect that if a President were having this conversation with a press corps in the [DATE] and [DATE], they'd say, well, we are for democracy; therefore, how come you are not? How come it had not happened yet in [GPE]? And yet it did eventually happen in [GPE]. The process and progress move at different paces and different places, and the role of [GPE] is to help encourage them along, while at the same time achieving certain national objectives. It just so happens that the key national objective in [DATE] is to make sure we do not get attacked again and innocent people get murdered. And so we can do both. We can say that in the long run, the best way to secure your society is through liberty. In the short run, let us work collaboratively to protect ourselves. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back on missile shields for [TIME]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. [PERSON] says that you are building a shield for weapons that do not exist now-- [INTERVIEWED]. Right. [INTERVIEWER1]. Does not he have a point? Do you see why he might be suspicious of that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would argue that it is best to anticipate what might happen and work to see that it does not happen, as opposed to not be prepared if it does happen. I mean, if somebody pops up with a weapon and says, Hands up, people will say, well, how come we did not have a shield? And so it is -I think we need to do both. I think we need to protect ourselves of what might happen and then work collaboratively to make sure it does not happen. [INTERVIEWER1]. On the missile defense system: If there is a misunderstanding between President [PERSON] saying that this is a threat towards [GPE] and the [GPE] saying it is not, what is more important, pushing the system through or maintaining a solid, good relationship with [GPE], especially since he is leaving office? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it is important to make sure we have a system to protect ourselves against the threats of [DATE], the true threats. And that would be the threat of rogue regimes using a weapon of mass destruction to either blackmail and/or attack allies and friends, cells moving through our societies with the intent upon killing, radical forces undermining young democracies. Those are the threats, and therefore, we need to address them. And I will continue to work with President [PERSON]-[PERSON]-to explain to him that this is not aimed at him. And there is all kinds of ways you can do that. [CARDINAL] is total transparency between our militaries and scientists-military people and scientists, which I am more than happy to do. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you see this as hurting the relationship between you and President [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. No. As I said, it is a complex relationship. We have had issues before. I think if you look at the history of our relationship, there is been some moments where we have agreed and moments where we disagreed. That is just the way-that is what happens when you have got nations that are influential. And we have had our disagreements with different allies, had disagreements with [GPE] over Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. We have had disagreements with other nations, but that does not mean they are not friends, or that does not mean we cannot work with them. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all concerned, though, that this current state of the relationship between you and President [PERSON] might have some implications for the outcome with regard to [GPE]? You have sort of relied on his-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have been working very closely with [GPE] on [GPE], and I do not think that this-first of all, my comments [DATE] were very realistic in the sense that said, we are friends; we have got a complex relationship; we can work together, but we have had some disagreements. I just do not see how-why that, those kinds of statements are going to prevent [GPE] and [GPE] from working closely together on key issues like [GPE] or proliferation, areas where we can get along. Obviously, there is disagreement. You mentioned [GPE]. No question, he does not agree with our position. And so we have got to work together and see if we cannot understand each other on a lot of issues. But it is an interesting question about, well, should not you just scrap the system? And the answer is, is that the system exists in the first place to deal with threats. And that is why it needs to go forward. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask about [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Have you expressed your frustration with why the international community has not been moving on [GPE]? You obviously introduced sanctions. Would you be prepared to see a no-fly zone over [GPE] to have some direct interaction? [INTERVIEWED]. We would consider that. And, yes, I have expressed my frustrations. [INTERVIEWER1]. You would consider it in what context? Would you want to see other people help establish-- [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I want to see other people helping [GPE] and-by joining us and sending clearer and stronger messages to President [PERSON]. And yeah, I am frustrated. It-because there are still people suffering, and yet the [ORG] process is moving at a snail's pace. As you know, I gave this speech at [ORG] and caveated it because the Secretary-General asked for a reasonable period of time to see if he could not get the process moving. [INTERVIEWER1]. And the reasonable period is over? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it was. That is why I gave my speech. And I do not know if you noticed, but [GPE] is now headed to peacekeeping at the [ORG] [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, will you pardon [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. It is interesting, is not it? And the second in charge is [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. And a no-fly zone, have you-- [INTERVIEWED]. I cannot give you all the tactics on it yet, but I understand the principle and said so in my speech that we would consider such. Listen, that was [DATE] for-[DATE] was [DATE] for [PERSON] and his family. But there is an ongoing process, and it would not be appropriate for me to discuss it until the process has run its course. [INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it says something about you and Vice President [PERSON], that you continue to embrace a man who has been convicted and sentenced? [INTERVIEWED]. No, it is a sad day for him, and my heart goes out to his family. And it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the case until after the legal remedies have run its course. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, there is a lot of speculation that you are going to pardon-- [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Back to [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, back to [GPE]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Fun stuff. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Nice going, [PERSON]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah, right. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. You seemed to have carefully calibrated your response to some of the comments that you made-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think what you ought to do-look, I would suggest going back and looking at a series of my responses. In other words, put-and [DATE] was an important speech to give about democracies. And I think in terms-if you want to really figure out how I conduct relations with [GPE], it would be helpful for you-if you are interested in writing a genuinely-I know you are-an indepth piece about how I have conducted relations with [GPE] to look at different comments I have made relative to different moments of drama or moments of discord or moments of agreement. And I have always said that, [CARDINAL], this is an important relationship. It is an important relationship because when we work together, we can solve problems. I have also said it is a complex relationship because there are disagreements. You asked why- I have not had a chance to talk to him about it. The insinuation was that he is doing this for internal political reasons. I cannot make that the case, and it would be unfair for me to put words in his mouth, and so therefore, I will not . I have also said it is important for there to be a personal relationship between me and President [PERSON] so that we can have frank discussions in a way that enables us to more likely deal with the problems we face. That is why I will visit with him here, and that is why I am looking forward to welcoming him to my dad's house in [GPE]. It is an opportunity to continue to have a serious dialog with serious players in trying to keep the peace. There will be disagreements; that is just the way life works. And-but that does not necessarily lend itself to speculation that somehow the relationship between me and [INTERVIEWED] is not a positive relationship. It is a positive, and I am going to work to keep it that way. There are some who say we should not have any relations with [GPE]. I strongly disagree with that. I think it is important for us to maintain relations with [GPE] and-on a variety of fronts, whether it be- you know, look, I want him to join the [ORG] for a reason. I believe it is -I think if trade increases between [GPE] and [GPE], it is important to have some structure and ways to resolve the inevitable disagreements that will arise. And that is what happens not only with a nation like [GPE]; that is what happens all the time in Europe. There is trade disputes where there needs to be a dispute resolution mechanism. And that is one of the things that the [ORG] provides. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWER1]. You talked about the need to prevent extremists from getting their hands on oil in the Middle East or anywhere else. How would you characterize how [PERSON] manages his country's energy resources? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, he is- he has got the opportunity to really develop the greatest asset of [GPE], and that is her brainpower. He is inherited a very difficult situation in [GPE]. The demographics indicate that it will be a shrinking society for a variety of reasons. [CARDINAL], it is health care system is good in parts of the country and not so good in other parts. They have got a needle issue; they have got HIV/AIDS issues. They have got a series of issues that he knows he has to deal with. They have got an old pensioner system. So that cashflow from oil will enable him to modernize his society, and he is making steps to do that. Secondly, it is a-obviously, it creates tensions with Europe. His being a sole source of natural gas for certain countries creates a degree of tension, and that is why [ORG] and [GPE] are continuing to work through their issues. The fundamental question is, will he make enough investment in his oil infrastructure to take advantage of these cashflows and, at the same time, make an investment inside his country? And he believes he is committed, enhancing human capital. The question is, is that-is the middle class going to continue to grow? It looks like it has grown substantially in the past. This country, again, is certainly not perfect in the eyes of many [NORP]. On the other hand, if you consider where it is come from, it has made substantial progress toward a freer society in the sense that there is a middle class that is growing and will eventually make more demands. Now, having said that, there is been-as I said [DATE], there is been some backtracking. We had expectations, and those expectations were not met. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask about [GPE]? The idea of the surge seemed to be to buy some time for the political leaders in [GPE] to make progress on reconciliation. Have you seen any real, meaningful progress on that front? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, look, they are close to getting an oil deal done. It is -it had not been the closure on certain issues, but they are working hard to get it there. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is that-I mean, they have been talking about that for a long time. It does not seem that they-the increased security operations have moved them to speed-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think on certain fronts, they have made progress. They have got a budget that is now moved out. They have got a-I know they are working on an oil law. They are working on different-discussing whether or not they have Provincial elections, and we hope they get-hope these issues come to fruition. But you are right, that is what the surge is intended to do, plus provide enough time for these [NORP] forces to step in, prevent the sectarian violence from spilling out of the capital. What is difficult is the fact that [ORG] continues to kill. And it frustrates the [NORP] people, and it should frighten the [NORP] people that [ORG] is active in [GPE] looking for a safe haven from which to launch further attacks. And they are the primary-they are the ones primarily responsible for these EID [IED] * and suicide bombers. [INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back to [PERSON]'s [[PERSON], [ORG]] question for [TIME]? [INTERVIEWED]. What was it? [INTERVIEWER1]. About [GPE]'s economic situation and the use of its oil wells. I guess my question is, are you concerned that [GPE]'s enormous energy wealth is going to kind of create a situation where its leaders are vulnerable to the arrogance of power? In other words, they have got an immense amount of wealth concentrated in their hands, and inevitably that tends to make people act in aggressive ways, does not it? [INTERVIEWED]. I think what-one reason why I promote rule of law throughout the world is to make sure that that very scenario does not accelerate. A second initiative that we all have got to take is to diversify away from hydrocarbons, and that is what will eventually yield to national security and economic security for countries that are dependent upon hydrocarbons from other places, such as ourself. You know, there is-there are mechanisms in place to basically enable nations to protect themselves; the [ORG] is a mechanism. If you noticed, there is constant jockeying here in Europe with [GPE] about security. No question, some nations are concerned about their supplies of gas being used for political purposes. And therefore, all of us need to work collaboratively to convince nations not to do that, whether it be [GPE] or any other nation that is supplying hydrocarbons to the world. You have heard me say, we import oil from places that do not necessarily like us. Oil is fungible, by the way. But nevertheless, we do. And therefore, it is in our interest, just like it is in the interest of other countries, to diversify. And that is really going to be the interesting challenge here as we move forward in [DATE]. [CARDINAL] of the dividends of diversification through new technologies is better environmental quality. And that is why this issue is-it is got a real poignancy, as far as I am concerned. [CARDINAL], I know we can be better stewards of the environment. But also, at the same time, it ends up making us less dependent on crude oil from overseas, in our case. It is coming, and the question is, how do you stimulate new technologies? What is the most effective way to get technologies to the market that will enable the world to control greenhouse gases, for example? And that is really where the-see, once you get people to agree to a goal, then the next question that needs to be answered is, how best to achieve that goal? We have taken the lead in achieving that goal by spending [MONEY] on new technologies. We have got new technologies being advanced in cellulosic ethanol. That will help nations once that becomes able to compete in the market. There is new battery technologies being promoted, primarily out of [GPE]. But nevertheless, it is -will have the beneficial effect of enabling people to drive without the use of gasoline. Clean coal technologies are going to be a really important part of a strategy to deal with what will be an international goal. And so the question is, how best to stimulate that type of investment? And that is an important discussion to have here at [ORG]. It is also an important discussion to have at home. [INTERVIEWER1]. [GPE]-President [PERSON] says that [GPE]'s nuclear program cannot be stopped. Is he right? [INTERVIEWED]. Therefore, let us build a missile defense system. And, yes, we are going to work to stop him. That is why we are constantly working through diplomatic channels to continue to apply pressure. And I mentioned [DATE], I think we need to go back to [ORG]. And we will see. [INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned [GPE] earlier. Do you think [GPE] could be a model for [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that-first of all, the situation inside [GPE] is different-or was different than it is in Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. On the other hand, [GPE] presence enabled the [NORP] economy and system to evolve and, at the same time, provided assurances to the [NORP] and the [NORP]. And you hear me say that-and compare the situation in the Middle East to what happened in the Far East. It is not to say that the cultures were the same or the difficulties in the different countries are the same. It is to say, however, that the [GPE] can provide a presence in order to give people confidence necessary to make decisions that will enable democracies to emerge and say to other people, step back and let the democracies emerge. It is very interesting to note that the [GPE] presence in the Far East was welcomed by different countries with different interests. But it helped achieve an objective for all of us, and [DATE], the Far East is peaceful. And it was not peaceful at the end of the Korean war; it was a place where [CARDINAL] of [NORP] had lost lives. And so the comparison between [GPE] and the Middle East is, again, not to say that the religious situation was the same- of course, it was different-nor to say that some of the influential players were the same; it is different. But it is to say that given time, these democracies will emerge. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think of the new [NORP] President? [INTERVIEWED]. I have not met him yet-I have met him-excuse me-but not as President.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmichaelsmerconishthemichaelsmerconishmorningshow", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. Hi, everybody. Welcome back to the program. I am [PERSON]. What an honor for me to say I am live at [FAC], and I am joined by [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED], what an honor for me, and thank you, sir, for this privilege, and thank you for coming back to my radio program. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], it is great to be on the show again. Every time we have been on, it is been a great time, so I appreciate the opportunity. [INTERVIEWER1]. Folks are stacked up, as you might imagine. They are anxious to pose some questions about health care to the President of [GPE]. [CARDINAL] e-mail suggestions have flowed through my web site in [TIME] alone. If it is all right, I will start by posing a couple of questions and some of the things that I continue to hear from folks, and we will welcome phone callers as well. Allow me, sir, to begin with this. Did Secretary [PERSON] misspeak [DATE]? You know, a great deal has been made as to what she said pertaining to the so-called public option. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. She really did not misspeak. The surprising thing is, she'd been saying this all along. She said the same thing [DATE]. And let me just describe what the issue is here. We have consistently talked about the need for health care reform because family premiums are going up [CARDINAL] times faster than inflation and wages. The costs of [ORG] and [ORG] will bankrupt this country if we do not reduce the cost inflation of health care. You have got families who cannot get health care because of preexisting conditions, or they bump up against some lifetime cap if a family member gets really ill. So what we have said is, there are a number of components of health care. [CARDINAL] is that for people who already have health insurance, they can keep their health insurance, but we are going to have some consumer protections to regulate how insurers operate. For example, they cannot prohibit people from getting it-health insurance-because of a preexisting condition. They cannot have lifetime caps or [DATE] caps that prevent people from getting the care that they need. We are also going-for people who do not have health insurance-to set up a system similar to what [ORG] has, where you can buy into a bigger pool, get better rates, have better protections around you. You would be buying that insurance from private insurers. But [CARDINAL] of the options we talked about was a public option, where there would not be a profit motive involved; it would be non-for-profit. And that public option would give you affordable health insurance. Now, what we have said is, we think that is a good idea. But we have not said that that is the only aspect of health insurance. And what she essentially said was, is that all these other insurance reforms are just as important as the public option. The press got a little excited, and some folks on the left got a little excited about this. Our position has not changed. We think that the key is cost control, competition, making sure that people have good, quality options. If we are able to achieve that, that is the end that we are seeking. And the means-you know, we can have some good arguments about what the best way to achieve it is, but we have got to change, because the status quo is unsustainable. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], there is a mindset among many folks in my audience who say that the endgame, it is all about single-payer, that it is a public option or it is a cooperative. And, sir, you know that there is a perception out there that you want it all. You know, you want to be in the banks, you want to be in the automotive industry, and now you want to be in health care. Can you address that mindset? [INTERVIEWED]. I absolutely can. First of all, look, the intervention in the banks was not started by me; it was started by a conservative [NORP] administration. And rightly so, because our banks were on the verge of meltdown. The only thing that we have done is said let us put in place some financial regulations to make sure that this does not happen again. The auto interventions were not started by me; they were started by a conservative [NORP] administration. The only thing that we did was rather than just write [ORG] and [ORG] a blank check, we said, you know what, if you are going to get any more taxpayer money, you have got to be accountable. They went through a record bankruptcy, and now [ORG] for the first time is actually hiring folks back. So I know that there is this perception that somehow we have engaged in these extraordinary interventions. Part of it had to do with the worst financial crisis in history. And the fact that both the auto bailout and the bank bailout were started under a previous, conservative [NORP] administration indicates the fact that this was not ideological; this was a matter of necessity. Now, as far as health care goes, I have consistently said I would love the private marketplace to be handling this without any Government intervention. The problem is, it is not working. What we are seeing is [CARDINAL] 000 folks lose their health insurance [DATE]. We are seeing health care inflation go up [CARDINAL] as fast as regular inflation. Businesses are being crippled by it. Small businesses especially have almost no access to the marketplace because they have got no leverage with insurance companies. So all we have said is, let us keep the private system intact, but let us make sure that people who right now cannot get health insurance-[CARDINAL]-that they are able to buy into the market. And [CARDINAL], let us have some consumer protections to make sure that those of us who have health insurance do not end up getting a bad deal because we did not read the fine print and we think that we have coverage; when we finally get sick and we need it, it turns out that we are vulnerable because insurance companies are not operating in the interests of their customers. [INTERVIEWER1]. I like to drive an MDX and an F-150, and I have communicated by e-mail in the last 24 hours with the woman who sold me the MDX and the guy who sold me the F-150, and each of them, [INTERVIEWED], are saying that Cash for Clunkers has been a great idea and a wonderful initiative, and they have closed a lot of deals, but the payments are late. And I am hearing from a number of folks who say, Come on, if [ORG] cannot get it together relative to Cash for Clunkers, I do not want to entrust my health care to [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me first address [ORG]. It has been successful beyond anybody's imagination. And we are now slightly victims of success, because the thing happened so quick, there was so much more demand than anybody expected that dealers were overwhelmed with applications. Now, this program has only been going on for [DATE], and we have hired [CARDINAL] times as many people to process this stuff as we originally had. There has not been extraordinary delays on [ORG] part. I understand dealers want to get their money back as soon as possible, but the fact of the matter is, this is a good-news story; they are seeing sales that they have not seen in [DATE]. And they will get their money, but we have got to process it properly, because if we were careless about it, if we were just sending out checks where applications were incomplete and so on, first of all, we'd be breaking the law because there are statutes set up in terms of how this is supposed to go. And secondly, there'd probably be some story-you'd be asking me about scandals, where there were a whole bunch of checks of taxpayer money being wasted, going out to people who had not actually bought cars. So I think this is actually a high-class problem to have, that we are selling too many cars too quickly and there is some backlog in the application process. It is getting fixed. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON] is a listener of mine on [ORG] in [GPE] and wishes to pose the following question. [PERSON], go ahead for the President of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER2]. Thank you, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]-- [INTERVIEWED]. How are you, [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWER2]. I am good. Thank you for taking this call. [INTERVIEWED]. Great to talk to you. [INTERVIEWER2]. I understand you have said that the Federal health care plan for Government employees is a pretty good plan. [INTERVIEWED]. It is. [INTERVIEWER2]. And [ORG] has voted, to my understanding, not to join the public plan once it passes because they want to keep their good [NORP] plan. Would you be willing to either urge [ORG] to have the [ORG] employees join the public plan, or would you be willing to urge [ORG] to somehow open up the Federal health plan to all [NORP]? [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, [PERSON]. I hear this all the time, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is a great question, [PERSON]. First of all, understand that currently, [ORG] employees have a very good health care plan because they are able to leverage the insurance companies. There are so many members of their-of the [ORG] workforce that they can get the best rates possible, for every insurance company wants to do business with [ORG]. So premiums are lower, and it is a better deal overall. The same concept is what we are trying to do in setting up what is called a health insurance exchange. Essentially, it'd be a marketplace where people who currently do not have health insurance or small businesses could pool their numbers so they have leverage over the insurance companies. And they could go on a web site and look at the various options, the types of various private health insurance plans that are being offered, and choose the one that is best for their families. So we are actually trying to duplicate what exists for [ORG] employees. We want to make that available to everybody else. Now, what we have said is, let us make a public option [CARDINAL] choice of many choices that are available to people who are joining the exchange. And I see nothing wrong with potentially having that public option as [CARDINAL] option for [ORG] employees as well. But the important thing that I think I have to make absolutely clear: Nobody would be obligated to choose the public option. If you went on that web site and you said, you know what, [ORG] or [ORG] are offering a good deal, and I would rather choose that plan than the public plan, you'd be perfectly free to do so. Nobody would be saying, you are obligated to go into a public plan. [INTERVIEWER1]. I think what folks are saying is that they'd love it if you'd stand up and say, whatever it is that we are creating, be it a co-op, be it a public option, whatever name ultimately might be ascribed to it, we in the executive branch, we in the [ORG], we will live with exactly these parameters. [INTERVIEWED]. I think there would be-I think it would make perfect sense for us to make the public option available to [ORG] employees as well. But keep in mind, it would just be a choice. [INTERVIEWER1]. Understood. Let me keep moving, if I may. [PERSON] listens on [ORG] in [GPE]. [PERSON], your question for [INTERVIEWED]. Health Care for Illegal Immigrants/The President's Health Care Reform Priorities [INTERVIEWER2]. [INTERVIEWED], thanks for taking my call. [INTERVIEWED]. Hi, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER2]. Hi. Until I heard you say that a private option is just a sliver of your health care proposal recently, I think myself and many [NORP] thought that pretty much was your proposal. [INTERVIEWED]. I know. [INTERVIEWER2]. So my question is, could you please quickly list [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] bullet points of what legislation must include for you to be willing to sign it? For instance, employer mandates, tort reform, illegal immigrants, what about them? Must it include a public option? [INTERVIEWED]. I'd be happy to. First of all, you mentioned illegal immigrants. This has been an example of just pure misinformation out there. None of the bills that have been voted on in [ORG] and none of the proposals coming out of [ORG] propose giving coverage to illegal immigrants-none of them. That has never been on the table; nobody has discussed it. So everybody who is listening out there, when you start hearing that somehow this is all designed to provide health insurance to illegal immigrants, that is simply not true and has never been the case. [INTERVIEWER1]. What is their fate, if I might ask? Because there is a [DATE] law on the book that says if you show up at an ER, you have got to be treated. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that will continue, because we do not want a situation in which some child, even if they are an illegal immigrant, shows up in an emergency room with tuberculosis and nobody is giving them treatment, and then they are going back to the playground and playing next to our kids. So there-I think there is a basic standard of decency where if somebody is in a death situation or a severe illness, that we are going to provide them emergency care. But nobody has talked about providing health insurance to illegal immigrants. I want to make that absolutely clear. Now, [PERSON], you had a good point about what are the bullet points that I want. Number [CARDINAL], it is got to be deficit neutral. This has to be paid for, because in the past, some of the health care plans that we have put forward have not been paid for. A good example of this was the prescription drug benefit for seniors. That was a important thing to do, but we never actually figured out how to pay for it. That just went directly into the deficit and the national debt. We cannot afford to do that. So that would be point [CARDINAL]. Point [CARDINAL], it has to bend the cost curve. What that means is that we have got to create a plan that experts credibly say will reduce health care inflation, because if all we are doing is adding more people, but we are not controlling costs, that will blow up the deficit over the long term, and it will blow up the burdens on individual families and businesses. We have got to get control of our costs. We spend $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] more than any other advanced country per person on health care. That is number [CARDINAL]. Number [CARDINAL], we have got to have the insurance reforms I talked about for people who already have health insurance. And that means making sure you can get health insurance even if you have got a preexisting condition, making sure that you are not burdened by lifetime caps, making sure that insurance companies cannot drop you just because you get sick or because you are older or because you are not as healthy; so making sure that there are basic insurance protections, that is very important. Number [CARDINAL] is I want to make sure that we have a health exchange, as I just described, that is similar to what Members of [ORG] have, where you will have a set of options. If you are a small business, if you are an individual, self-employed, you have trouble getting health insurance right now, you can go and look at a bunch of options. And we have got to make it affordable for middle class families, so part of the plan has to be that if you cannot afford a market-based premium, that we are giving you a little bit of help and you are able to get health insurance. Choice, competition, reducing costs-those are the things that I want to see accomplished in this health reform bill. Personal Responsibility for Health [INTERVIEWER1]. Where, [INTERVIEWED], does personal responsibility factor into all this? There was a front-page story in [ORG] recently that talked about obesity being the single most significant factor. I mean, you are a fit guy. How about rewarding those who get on a StairMaster [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the interesting thing is, you are already starting to see this happen among a lot of private companies. [ORG], for example, is a company that has done a great job in helping encourage its employees to get fit, and they actually give them an incentive. They say, Look, we are -you are going to save X amount on your insurance premiums; you will see that in your paycheck if you are taking steps to take care of yourself. And I think that creating incentives like that for prevention, for wellness, creating cash incentives for people who-where it shows up they are saving money on their health insurance because of it, I think that is something that should be part of this. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON] listens to me at [ORG], which is [FAC] in [GPE]. [PERSON], go ahead for the President of [GPE]. Bipartisan Cooperation on Health Care Reform [INTERVIEWER2]. Thank you for taking my call, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Hey, [PERSON], how are you? [INTERVIEWER2]. Oh, I am scared out of my mind talking to you here. [Laughter] I am a supporter, worked hard for you [DATE]. The President. I appreciate you. [INTERVIEWER2]. And I am getting a little ticked off that it feels like the knees are buckling a little bit. You have an overwhelming majority in both the [ORG] and the [ORG], and you own the whole shooting match. And I am just not getting-it is very frustrating to watch you try and compromise with a lot of these people who are not willing to compromise with you. [INTERVIEWER1]. Are your knees buckling? That is his question. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I guarantee you, [PERSON], we are going to get health care reform done. And I know that there are a lot of people out there who have been hand-wringing, and folks in the press are following every little twist and turn of the legislative process. You know, passing a big bill like this is always messy. It is -FDR was called a socialist when he passed [ORG]. [PERSON] and [PERSON], they were both accused of a [ORG] takeover of health care when they passed [ORG]. This is the process that we go through, because, understandably, the [NORP] people have a long tradition of being suspicious of government until the government actually does something that helps them, and then they do not want anybody messing with whatever gets set up. And I am confident we are going to get it done, and as far as negotiations with [NORP], my attitude has always been, let us see if we can get this done with some consensus. I would love to have more [NORP] engaged and involved in this process. I think early on a decision was made by the [NORP] leadership that said, Look, let us not give them a victory, and maybe we can have a replay of [DATE], [DATE] when [PERSON] came in. He failed on health care, and then we won in the midterm elections, and we got the majority. And I think there is some folks who are taking a page out of that playbook. But this is-should not be a political issue. This is a issue for the [NORP] people. There are a bunch of [NORP] out there who have been working very constructively. [CARDINAL] of them, [PERSON] in [GPE], she is been dedicated on this. [PERSON], [PERSON], others-they have been meeting in [ORG]. I want to give them a chance to work through these processes. And we are happy to make sensible compromises. What we are not willing to do is give up on the core principle that [NORP] who do not have health insurance should get it, that [NORP] who do have health insurance should get a better deal from insurance companies and have consumer protections. We have got to reduce health care inflation so that everybody can keep the health care that they have. That is going to be my priorities, and I think we can get it done. Release of [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. A bit off message, [DATE] the [NORP] released the [GPE] bomber due to-actually, maybe it is health care-related. He is got terminal cancer. Your take on this-a lot of folks very offended over a perceived lack of justice. [INTERVIEWED]. We have been in contact with [ORG] indicating that we objected to this, and we thought it was a mistake. We are now in contact with [ORG], and want to make sure that if in fact this transfer has taken place, that he is not welcomed back in some way, but instead should be under house arrest. We have also, obviously, been in contact with the families of the [ORG] victims and indicated to them that we do not think this was appropriate. [GPE]/Pakistan [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], in each of our prior [CARDINAL] conversations, I spoke with you extensively about the need for closure, and we agreed relative to [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And as a matter of fact-and this is well documented; I have written and spoken about it extensively-things that you said during the course of the campaign played a critical role in my personal decisionmaking pertaining to the [DATE] election. So I feel I'd be derelict in my duty if I did not come here [DATE] and say, where are we? I know we had a major victory recently with the number-[CARDINAL] individual for the [ORG] in those tribal regions. But pertaining to [PERSON] and [PERSON], where is it? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, here is where we are at. We are continuing to ramp up the pressure in [GPE]. And we had a-what appears to be a successful election in [GPE] despite the [ORG]'s effort to disrupt it. You have got General [PERSON] now over there and more troops who are putting pressure on the eastern and southern portions of [GPE]. On the other hand, you have got [ORG] for the first time actually fighting in a very aggressive way, and that is how we took out [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. --the top [ORG] leader in [GPE], who was also one of [PERSON] key allies. So the goal here is essentially to have a pincer, where we are squeezing them on both sides. We are eliminating their allies. It is making it more difficult for them to communicate, making it more difficult for them to operate safe havens, and over time, what we hope to do is to flush them out. We are going to keep on putting pressure on them, and I know that it is at great cost. I mean, I have to sign letters to family members who have fallen, and a lot more are falling in [GPE] than in [GPE]. And as a consequence, we have got to make sure that we are really focused on finishing the job in [GPE], but it is going to take some time. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON] listens to [ORG] in [GPE]. [PERSON], go ahead for the President of [GPE]. Q. Yes, thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED], for talking to us directly about this important issue. Health Care Reform at the State Level [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Q. We all want reform. I guess it is really a matter of what the best solution is. And a lot of us feel that [ORG] is just not equipped or it is their role to be getting involved in delivering health care services. And we are very concerned that most of the money will actually go-instead of taking care of people, it will go to, you know, the cost of administering a huge Government bureaucracy. Why not do something more like giving incentives to the [GPE]? Like here in [GPE], we already have free health care for people who cannot afford it. And you know, it should only be for people who cannot afford it, not for the 20- and [DATE] that choose to spend their money on SUVs and the latest electronic gadgets. And it is not free, because we all know that we are going to be paying for it, and it should be only for the people who cannot really afford it. And we want to have our own health care decisions locally, and we do not want [ORG] making those decisions for us. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is there a State solution here, [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, first of all, [PERSON], I think that it is important to understand that part of the health reform proposal that we have put forward would involve the [GPE]. The States, in some cases, would be empowered to expand [ORG] to cover more people the same way that they have been able to cover more children under [ORG]. So a sizable portion of the people who are currently uninsured would in fact be getting their insurance through the [GPE]. That is how the current [ORG] program is able to allow [NORP] to cover more people. Keep in mind that nobody is talking about the Government administering all of health care. What we are talking about here is a public option that people could sign up for, but in that situation, they'd have to operate like any private insurer. They'd have to be collecting premiums and so forth. The track record for [ORG] administering health care actually is surprisingly good. [ORG], for example, a [ORG] program, has much lower administrative costs than private insurers do. Now, part of it is, is because they do not have-either somebody is qualified or they are not, and so signing them up is a lot more automatic. But that points to one of the big problems that we have. In private insurance, huge amounts of insurance companies are spending a lot of money and a lot of effort and a lot of staff just trying to cherry-pick people who are healthy and sign them up and then eliminate people who are sick. And part of what we want to do here is just reform the system so that insurance companies are operating more fairly to all people. If you are young, actually, it is easier to get health insurance [DATE]. The really tough population are folks who are [DATE]. Maybe they just got laid off. Maybe they are self-employed. They have a whale of a time trying to buy health insurance, and we want to make sure that there is a market for them. Last point that I would make is that, you mention the fact that a lot of young people opt out. [CARDINAL] of the things that we would do under reform is to say, if you want, you can stay on your health insurance-or your parents' health insurance up to [DATE]. That would cover a lot of young people who they-fall in that gap. Their first job does not necessarily offer them insurance. It gives them a way of having coverage until they get that job that has a little bit more security. [INTERVIEWER1]. You are needed across town. I appreciate very much the privilege of coming to [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much for being on the [PERSON] program. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], it is always a pleasure. And I want to thank all your listeners, terrific questions. There is a great dialogue that takes place on this show, and I just hope that we can continue that dialogue in the same spirit to solve some of [GPE]'s big problems. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. I will be back in [TIME] from [FAC].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmiddleeasternjournalists", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. I wanted to just say a word of welcome to you all, and be glad to thank you for coming all this way. I think the best thing is just to go ahead and start, though I might say at the beginning that the coalition that was put together to stand up against the aggression has been, in my view, historic. There were a lot of predictions early on that [CARDINAL] or another country would pull away or that it would fracture in some and you come to me on a day when I have great gratitude in my heart to the leaders of the coalition countries. Well, I guess all the countries from which you have come having had forces there [GPE], of course, in a special role, not a part of the coalition per se but nevertheless in the defense of [GPE], having some soldiers on the ground. That is a distinction that I wanted to say to you, sir, we understand and respect. But in any event, those forces that did end up in the battle did very well. There were predictions that some might not want to engage in the battle, and they did, and so we are very grateful. And I keep saying [CARDINAL] things: [CARDINAL], this is not a [GPE] effort by itself. And secondly, our argument was never with the people of [GPE]; it was with [PERSON]. I make this point because the [NORP] tried to make it them I mean them including all [NORP] against [GPE]. And I will resist that until time immemorial, because there is a feeling of gratitude and affection to the [NORP] world because so many there stood with us against this evil. But now, look, I came to answer your questions, and I will try to do so. Who wants to go first? [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, my colleagues have elected that I speak first. I would like to take the opportunity to thank you personally, the administration and this great country and people, for what you have done. I believe this is an historical stand. And as our Ambassador has said, you will go into history as a great leader and a great man. Sir, my first question is, the coalition has won the war, and I believe we have a great battle ahead of us, that is, to win the peace. What kind of arrangement do you foresee [GPE], the coalition, and [GPE] and, of course, the [NORP] would have for security arrangements within [GPE] and [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think this is a time, as [PERSON] once said in our history, to think anew. And we are starting to think anew by dispatching our Secretary of [ORG] to the region. There will not be a [GPE] plan to bring peace to [GPE], to the Gulf, or to the [NORP]-Palestine question. There will not be a single, sole [GPE] plan. We want to be an instrumental part of it. We think, given what is happened in the Gulf, perhaps we have more credibility to be a part of it. When I spoke at our meeting to the joint session of [ORG] [DATE], I spoke about our interest in being a catalyst for peace. And that is what [PERSON] is out there to do. I would love to think that the day would come when the [NORP]-Arab world hostility could end. And that is going to take compromise on both sides. We are very openminded as to how that should be brought about. When I talked about territory for peace, that was not exactly a new statement. We have been proponents of Resolutions 242 and 338 for a long time, and so have other countries, many other countries. I'd say most every country, but then some have pulled away from them. So, we are going to push, after consultation, in trying to get common ground with our coalition partners and then with [GPE] and others, to push on all [CARDINAL] fronts. Obviously, the security in the Gulf is quite different. I will repeat I do not want to lecture here, but I will repeat that we are not interested in a longterm ground troop presence. The [NORP], for example, are accusing us, or not accusing us but are very much concerned about that. So are others. And we would be playing right into the hands of our critics if we sent a signal that we wanted to leave a sizable [GPE] force on the ground out there. We do not . Our families want them home. But on the other hand, I spelled out the other day some security requirements for the Gulf and what we think might be new arrangements that will provide for a more stable and more secure Gulf. [GPE], again, and the [NORP] question these will be evolved after the [PERSON] consultations. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], President [PERSON] has called once again for a Middle East, including [GPE], free of weapons of mass destruction. Do you agree with this initiative and other proposals for the limitation of arms shipments to the region, including [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. You heard me speak on proliferation. I do not think you are going to disarm [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] anybody. I think that is idealistic. I am not implying that that what my dear friend [PERSON] is saying. But I would like to think that out of all this we could have a vastly reduced flow of arms to this troubled corner of the world. We have been very much concerned about these shipments. In some places we have been involved in them, to many of the countries right here in which your papers are located and [GPE]. But when I made this pitch for nonproliferation [DATE], it is something that again we want to talk about within this whole concept of security and stability, not of just the Gulf region but of the other parts of the Middle East as well. So, I am not certain how we will come down, what the final arrangements will be, but we are very openminded about talking and then doing what we say after we talk, in terms of fewer weapons going into the area. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], do you foresee any future role for [GPE] and [GPE] in the security arrangement? [INTERVIEWED]. Roles for [GPE] and [GPE]? Well, in the first place, we never have felt that it was in the interest of the Gulf or certainly of [GPE] to create a vacuum in [GPE]. And we have not wanted an unstable [GPE]. [GPE] has a job to do of reconstruction. And what they ought to do is have a government that will signal to the rest of the world that they want to live within their own borders, that they are renouncing aggression. And indeed, they did renounce the annexation of what they used to arrogantly refer to as [GPE] 19. So, they have got to send the signal to the world that they want to live within what we call the family of peace-loving nations. That is difficult, very candidly, for us. And one of the things [PERSON] will talk about with our partners is whether it is difficult for them if [PERSON] remains in power. So, [GPE] we want to see stable, living within its own borders with respect for its neighbors, renouncing its so-called claim to [GPE], and yes, being an important part of the area. [GPE] can be a very well-to-do country if they'd spend their money on helping their own people and not on arms and bullying the neighborhood, which they tried to do until they got into the war with [GPE]. Then the man changed his spots momentarily. Then when that war was over, he showed his arrogance and bullying again by going after [GPE]. So, the best answer, as we see it and again, with respect for our partners, I want to know exactly what they think but is for [GPE] to live in its borders, and then it can regain the respect that they deserve. They have got a proud history. They have got culture. They have got religious traditions and all. So, we are open to that. But it is going to be difficult under the status quo. On [GPE], we have had very strained relations with [GPE]. I have publicly said, and I will repeat it this is a unique chance to repeat it here we want better relations with [GPE]. We have no animosity. There is a lot of feeling in our country about our hostages and about the [FAC], and there is feelings in [GPE] about the shooting down, which was pure accident, of the airbus and all of this. But sometimes when you have deep divisions it takes a little more time. So, we are not pressing [GPE] on bilateral relations. But [GPE] is a big country. I do not think they should be treated forever as enemies by all the countries out in the [ORG] [[ORG]] countries or others. And I do not think, as I listen carefully to our friends in the Gulf I think there is an evolution process here towards [GPE]. And as [GPE] moves to what I hope will be a more moderate or a less radical role, I think that the other countries in the area will welcome them back. But they are an important country and they have got a self-respect. And so, we'd like to find ways to recognize that of self-respect and their own sovereignty, of course. But we have got some bilateral problems. So, I think both of them, being of their size, of their economic potential, of their historic standing, have key roles to play in a secure and stable Gulf. But again, it is got to evolve how that will work, I mean, what mechanics are worked out. Will there be an [NORP] peacekeeping force there, and can that be presented to all the countries as no threat to them, but as a guarantee of the security of other countries? So, we want this remember in [DATE] of all this, talk about [NORP] solution King [PERSON] kept talking about, We want an [NORP] solution. And they had meetings and others saying [NORP], and we understood that. We do not want a [NORP] solution to the Middle East. [Laughter] I mean, that is not what we want. So, here is a chance now for our friends in the [NORP] world and there are many, and I hope there are more than when all this started to say, look, here is where we should carry the ball; here is the place we should have the lead. And then we stand there with our, I would say, conviction backed up by perhaps a naval presence that I mentioned coming up and down the Gulf. It has helped with stability. And I see it as that kind of partnership in the future, but with no rancor in my heart about [GPE], no rancor about the people of [GPE]. So, when I get up and say that here, I am not just making it up. Because we hurt, we ache when we see a child that does not have enough food, or water that is contaminated, or something of that nature. And I think people in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] they feel the same thing when they see an [NORP] child. So, we have got to approach it in a magnanimous, compassionate way. But let our [NORP] friends stand out there and say: Here is what we recommend. Here is what we are prepared to do. And then have us willing to put our military and whatever they want behind this effort. So, that one is easier, it seems to me, the Gulf security including [GPE] and [GPE], than perhaps [GPE] and the [GPE] question as it relates to [GPE]. I am going on too long, but I want to make a point that we have been very disappointed in the [ORG] here. I mean, the [ORG] was anointed at [GPE] [DATE] as the sole spokesmen in all of this, and they have been disappointing. They have moved way over too far in support of [PERSON]. They took a bet they bet this coalition would not hold, and they bet [GPE] would not do what we did. And the guy bet wrong. Here was a man that, in spite of the recent terrorist acts, had some standing in this country. I do not know how it is in the rest of the world, but he is lost that standing here. And that is not to mean that we say to everybody that was sympathetic to the [ORG], hey, you are bad guys; that is not it. But they have been diminished by this. So, their role in the security, at least for now, in my view, has been diminished because they bet on the wrong horse for the wrong reasons, the wrong motives. I mean, they did not stand up and condemn that aggression. And I think it has hurt some of the [NORP] in [GPE] who had been treated very well there. And then when the [GPE] thing happens, a lot of the [NORP] sided with the [NORP] invaders. Well, this did not help their image around [GPE]. I can only speak for our country. [INTERVIEWER1]. What do you mean by political rights to [NORP] people in your speech? [INTERVIEWED]. About political rights? Listen, there will not be peace until the whole question of where the [NORP] have a right to be is taken care of. And some say state. It is not been our position in favor of the state, and there we differ with many of our [NORP] friends. But the question is, get the [GPE] question resolved. And obviously, the framework has got to be the action taken by [ORG]. Or at least, that does not have to be the only answer, but that is some common ground there. That is something that [GPE] agreed to, that is something that [NORP] States agreed to, and is subject to a lot of interpretation problems. But there is a common place to start from. But there is got to be discussions. We cannot have state of war forever and ever. I mean, we are in kind of a healing mode now. I'd like to heal some wounds. I'd like to be a catalyst that can help overcome old enmities. Now, maybe that is too idealistic, but even if he cannot do that, there has got to be a resolution of the [GPE] question. And we know it, and we feel strongly about it, and we are prepared to play a useful role. But as I say, people are going to have to move on all sides of this question. The status quo ain't going to get the job done. Q. You had a talk with the [ORG]; are you willing to resume the talks? [INTERVIEWED]. I would not say right now. They are coming at us at the wrong time. I do not think they have requested that. They were broken off because, as you recall, some terrorists what we call terrorism. They were calling it something else. But I think I would be very and I am one who wanted to keep those talks going and did as long as we could. But to me, they have lost credibility. They have lost credibility with this office right here. And the reason they have is because they behaved very badly to those of their own fundamental faith. That is not all [ORG] people; I am sure there are some good people there. But their leadership betrayed their friends and got in with the wrong side. And it is going to take some time. So, I am not in any rush to do that at all. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, excuse me. I have [CARDINAL] points. The first is the immediate problems we are facing, and the other one is a medium-term. The first one is the environment. Now we have oil spillage and this fire. The second one, sir, I am speaking I think the medium-range sort of problems in our region, to my mind, is democracy and development. What is your [INTERVIEWED]. Okay. First, the environment. I have been surprised that in this country there has not been more of a highlighted moral outrage. I feel a moral outrage here. I feel that what he has done, laying waste to the assets of [GPE], is brutal environmental terrorism. There is no excuse for it. There is no rationale for it. It is simply what we call the scorched earth policy, as he left. That is unacceptable. I think world judgment is going to take a while to mature in this regard. People here hate it, but there is not that visceral feeling about what this man has done. As time goes by and the shooting has stopped, thank God, and people come back into [GPE] as they are, thank heavens, I think people are more and more going to be outraged by it. [CARDINAL] of the reasons that we insisted on accountability and on [CARDINAL] of the [ORG] resolutions that called for compensation was because we felt so strongly about the environmental degradation. And [GPE] is entitled to compensation for this kind of environmental terrorism. And so are others who might be affected by that spill. So, [CARDINAL], we are very much concerned about it, and I think it is going to be a focal point. It has not yet been as much as I thought it would be a focal point for indignation against this laying to waste, reckless laying to waste, of another country. What was your second point? [INTERVIEWER1]. Democracy and development. [INTERVIEWED]. Of course, [GPE], you know, we are for democracy. Obviously, the more democratic processes that are put into effect in whatever country, we rejoice in that. That is been the history of our country. We are not trying to dictate to some country how to do its internal affairs. But the more compatible the values, the better it is for the future. We urge as much democratic process as possible in the area and in all areas. So, we just stand as a beacon, we think, for democracy, and we will continue to try to do it. As you know, halfway around the world I was criticized for not standing stronger for democracy in [GPE]. I thought I stood very strongly for it. But there is a balance here between expressing your own convictions about your own values and having respect for problems that others have. So, on development, I think the resources are there. And if those resources can be turned to peaceful means, so not only a country that has valued peace take [GPE] but it has had to worry about whether it would be aggressed against or whether its neighbors were going to do something. But if we can get this new order out there, then I think the means are there for the development of the entire region. But it is not going to be done with the barrel of the gun. And you cannot say to [GPE], to [GPE], Hey, trust me, all is well, throw down your arms, as long as you have a situation in the Gulf that is unstable. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], one of the main reasons of instability in the region, originally in the Mideast, is the big gap between the rich and the poor countries. And recently, after the Gulf war, there have been many ideas proposed to tackle this problem. And I think Secretary [PERSON] he once mentioned a sort of new international development bank for the Middle East or something like that. What are your ideas, [INTERVIEWED], I mean the [GPE] ideas to deal with this problem? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not want to try to preempt the [PERSON] trip. He is going out there to discuss economic development. And there are a lot of resources in the area. People look at [GPE] and say, hey, there is a lot of resources in [GPE], too. And there are. But when we tried to assist [GPE] with its rather substantial debt to [GPE], you know I came under great attack here: Hey, wait [TIME], what the hell are you doing worrying about [GPE]'s debt? What about [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and other places in our own country? What about our budget deficit of [MONEY]? So, we are not in a great position to be putting ourselves up as the wealthy guy that can solve all the problems in other areas. But there are discrepancies in wealth in the area, just as there are in my own country. There are a lot of people here in poverty. Some people live very well. The same thing is true in the entire Middle East. But I think the way to work it out is through consultation and through planning and through regional answers to it. We cannot dictate. We cannot say to a wealthy country out there: Hey, you have got to spend [MONEY] to help your guy next door. I do not think that is the way. I mean, that would be really resented in that part of the world. Just as I would resent it if some wealthy countries in other parts, or Europe, for example, started telling me how to take care of poverty in [GPE]. So, again I want to fall back on the [PERSON] consultations, which will have this economic ingredient, this development ingredient as part of it. Having said that, I think all of us as human beings have to be concerned when there is a lot of inequity. And I feel it here. I do not get given any credit in this country for feeling it, but I do. I worry about it. And I certainly worry about it in other parts. But to try to justify aggression on the basis of the haves versus the have nots is unacceptable. And I do not think we can ever permit that kind of demagogic rationalization to justify the takeover of [CARDINAL] country by another. And I, to be honest with you on that point, I had never considered [GPE] a have-not country. I have considered them a country that has tremendous resources that they splurged on trying to buy support with [ORG] and arming themselves to the teeth so that they could bully the neighborhood. Well, [DATE] are over and I am damn proud that we had a part, working with our partners, in putting an end to it. I say they are over. They better be over, or [GPE] will not have normalized relations with this country. I can speak for the [GPE] [INTERVIEWER1]. No, what I mean, it is not just to give. To help in development, because through development, this will have a solution for these problems. [INTERVIEWED]. It would be a fantastic thing to do. No, excuse me, I was not lecturing you on the fact that we do not need development. I am simply saying it is something that is going to have to be addressed, but that we cannot use we cannot permit [CARDINAL] neighbor to take over another because he is doing it in the name of have or versus have not. But I think there is a wonderful chance now for economic development where one country will want to help another. [GPE] has always been in that mode, and we will want to try to help. All I am saying is we are going to need we are not going to pull back into some sphere of isolation as a result of all this. But once again, it is with respect that I say, hey, we need some regional answers out here. We need some [NORP] solutions. And let us be a part of it but not try to dictate it, is all I am saying on development and on how we handle the inequities of wealth versus nonwealth. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you talked about [GPE] recently, and you said you are not going to pay any penny for rebuilding [GPE]. What about if there is a new government of [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. What we are willing to do is immediately help in a humanitarian way. If there is a hungry child, if there is a sick family, we will go there [DATE]; [DATE] we will be there. We have always done that. But as you look at the overall reconstruction of [GPE], what they need to do is come up with a plan where they use their wealth for their own reconstruction, and then be able to have a good life for their people from there on. They can do it. They have got enormous wealth. And if they had a new government that had a broad futuristic view, that contained the willingness to live at peace with their neighbors, throw down these excessive arms what they have got left, keep what they need for their own internal security guarantee their neighbors they have nothing to fear from them, then of course we'd be willing, in a broad sense through these international agencies and others, to be helpful in terms of reconstruction. But it is not the case where we are going to turn around as Uncle [PERSON], not Uncle Sam but Uncle [PERSON], and turn around and start sending taxpayers' money that are going to rebuild the arrogance that has led to this instability in the first place. And I will tell you, the [NORP] people feel strongly about it. And there is [CARDINAL] of us, and nobody feels more strongly about it than the guy sitting right here. We are not inhumane, but let us see the new government develop. Let us see them give the assurances to their neighbors they want to live at peace. Let us see them show the concern for their own people that they should have. And that means not spending it all on rifles from [GPE] or tanks, but it is on trying to help turn on those oil wells, get those going again, and help their people. That is my point. That is what I was trying to say [TIME]. But everything takes time, too. This situation needs time. But the best thing that could happen is if the kind of government you asked about emerges; then you'd see whole new attitudes emerge in Europe and [GPE] and everyplace else. [INTERVIEWER1]. What kind of government do you think that ought to be? [INTERVIEWED]. One that is compassionate and concerned about his own people and drops all this arrogance about the neighborhood. That would be a good place to start. And I have known before the Iran-Iraq war I used to wrestle with these problems when I was at [ORG]. And these guys from other [NORP] countries have come up and told me this man's a bully. He will walk into a room with other [NORP] leaders and swagger in with his bullying the neighbors. And he had muscle. He had arms, when some of them had not gone to the arms route. He had an arrogant swagger that tried to intimidate his [NORP] neighbors. Then he got into the Iran-Iraq war and that changed, because he needed help. So, he turned to those against whom he'd been arrogant and showed a different side momentarily. Then that war ended. And what does he do? He brutalizes [GPE]. So, he cannot have that kind of an attitude if he wants reasonable relations with us. And that is what I am saying. We tried with [GPE]. We tried just before the end of the [GPE]-Iraq war to have better relations and to see a different side. And what happens? He takes over [GPE], and that was it right there. Bang that is enough for us. And again, we are not the ones that are trying to dictate to that corner of the world. I have been out there. I have respect for the countries and their cultures and their traditions and for their sovereignty. And in this office, as long as I am here, whether we have a big country or a small country, we are going to respect that. But I do not respect the bullying attitude that resulted now in the aggression against [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, while we are on the point, do you envisage more sort of cooperation with the [ORG] themselves on [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I think as much as possible. And I think as more of a security arrangements as can be arranged for and taken over by the [ORG], the better it is. It is their neighborhood. We have got a stake in it for a lot of reasons economic reasons and historic reasons but absolutely. And the more vital the [ORG] is, the more it can say here is what is best for the Gulf area, in my view, so much the better. And I will keep using this thing here, the telephone, and talking to these leaders out there. And we are going to keep up good bilateral relations with as many countries as possible. But the needs are regional; it is crying out for a regional answer to it. The complex problems that you ask about are a little different. It is not strictly regional. It is more global in a sense because it is been so intractable. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, [INTERVIEWED] Mr. [PERSON]. We are going to have to break, gentlemen. [INTERVIEWER1]. The last question. [INTERVIEWED]. Let me and then I will try not to lecture you so much. I get all I am very enthusiastic about this. I remember being back as Ambassador at [ORG]. And I did not know as much about diplomacy then, but I became very close to the Ambassadors from the [NORP] world. [DATE] I left, they gave a beautiful going-away party, in spite of the fact that we had stood against them or at least they thought, against them on some of the [GPE] questions. I will never forget it. And [PERSON], who is the head of the [ORG] he was the [GPE] Ambassador at that time. Through not only contact with him but remember the guy [PERSON] really [NORP] and they became close friends, and they taught me a lot about the individual traditions of the countries. [PERSON] was my colleague at the [ORG] So when I sit down and talk to [PERSON], I have been conditioned and sensitized by these friends of mine in that area. And I want to reflect my feeling about these countries through how we conduct ourselves. [CARDINAL] of the things that made it easier for us to commit an enormous amount of treasure and risk a lot of human life was that we feel this area and its importance more than, I think, perhaps some of my predecessors. That does not mean we are not going to have fights with representatives from the various countries represented here. But we do not want to do it out of neglect or out of failing to understand the intense pride of the region. Now, what was the question? Q. Sir, I do think that everybody in [GPE] and a lot of people in the [ORG] and their countries look to Mr. [PERSON] as a great man. And this is the first time in history I have seen so many articles about [GPE], about Mr. [PERSON] being published, not clandestinely like you were before, but now everything is open. What kind of relations do you envisage between this country and the Gulf GCC? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, again, I think it has to be one of mutual respect. I think it has to be one who fiercely recognizes and is willing to defend the territorial integrity of the country. I think it has to be one where we are forward-leaning on the peace process as it relates to [GPE] and [GPE]. Because in these countries, no matter how good our bilateral relations, there is this feeling hey, you ought to be doing more about that question. I see it as one where we will be tested by whether I am willing to do what we have said, be a catalyst for peace not just in the Gulf but up into [GPE] and down into the [NORP]-Palestine question. But what I hope will happen is that because of the commitment we made, after great consultation in your country's case, the Amir; the case of [GPE]of [GPE]], with King [PERSON] himself; a close relationship with [PERSON] I hope that [GPE] will and I think it is true in [GPE], although we had a little different standing for [GPE] in this I hope that there will be a recognition that we are credible friends. And this is an important point, that we have credibility. When we say we will do something, we will do it; we mean it. And that is an important point as to how the [GPE] interacts with the Middle East from now on, it seems to me. If they say they are going to do what they say they will do, I think that is important. I think a lot of lip service was given to that point, but for various reasons, including global reasons, [GPE]. People would Look, hey, do they really mean this? Are they really going to follow through? And I think that our credibility should be such in the area that we can work closely now as credible allies, credible friends. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], the Gulf war is the first of its kind to take place in the context of the new world order. How did the new world order influence the way the world dealt with this crisis? And what is the main lesson learned from the Gulf war? [INTERVIEWED]. The new world order said that a lot of countries, disparate backgrounds, with differences, can come together standing for a common principle. And that principle is: You do not take over another country by force. So, the new world order, to the degree it is emerged so far, has been enhanced by this single concept that we are going to unite, no matter what other differences we may have had, what the bilateral problems may have been, and we are going to stand up against aggression. It was enhanced by a more viable [ORG], [ORG] where the big powers did not automatically go against each other. In [DATE], we'd say, This is black, and the [NORP] would say, Hey, that is white. And you'd have a veto, and nothing would happen. And the peacekeeping dreams of the founders of the [ORG] were dashed. So, part of this new world order has been moved forward by [ORG] that functioned. We might have still been able to stand up and come to the assistance of [GPE] [GPE]. I might have said, To hell with them. It is right and wrong. It is good and evil. He is evil; our cause is right, and, without [ORG], sent a considerable force to help. But it was an enhanced it is far better to have this collective action where the world, not just [ORG] but the whole [ORG], stood up and condemned it. So, part of it is these more viable international organizations. And that is where we are now. Then how we build on it is the questions that will be coming up, trying to give our share of the answers when [PERSON] comes back from these consultations. [INTERVIEWER1]. And what is the lesson which we learned from this crisis? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the [CARDINAL] key lesson is: Aggression will not stand. You do not bully your neighbor. You do not swagger around the neighborhood with an arrogance and back it up by overwhelming force without paying a price. Same thing you learned in the school yard when you were over there in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] guy came out and tried to beat the hell out of you when you are in the third grade, and you'd wait for a while, and then somebody would hit him and he'd go back into his shell and he would not do it again. And that is what happened in this case. Same thing. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], I am too greedy. I want to make [CARDINAL] questions. [INTERVIEWED]. You have got it. [Laughter] They have another way of doing it over here, saying and a followup, you know. They will ask you something unrelated and call it a followup so they can get [CARDINAL]. [GPE]-U.S. Relations [INTERVIEWER1]. You made a step toward [GPE] and a good relationship with them. How do you see now the relation between [GPE] and [GPE] regarding [GPE], especially? [INTERVIEWED]. We have had some differences with [GPE] that we have spoken very frankly about regarding terrorism and other things. I think that because we were able to work together with [GPE] here and we did this there was a lot of advice coming from other coalition partners that encouraged me to take additional steps toward [GPE]. Because of that I think we have a much better chance to work with them toward peace in [GPE]. [GPE] has interests there. We are not saying they have no interests there. But these Taif accords are still valid, and the steps that the [NORP] leaders took there in terms of getting all forces out and democratization or better representation in the government inside [GPE], those are good things. But I think the key point to your question is, because we worked together on this [CARDINAL] problem over here, the Gulf, and some doubts about each other were kind of laid to rest, we have a chance now to work toward the solution of other problems. And you know, they are very we have said very intractable on the [NORP] question, and they have said we have been overly [CARDINAL]-sided. At least we are talking. And at least they did what they said they'd do, and we did what we said we'd do. And so, I think in terms of [GPE], we have got a window we have got a big door we can walk in, not a window but a door, where we can openly discuss things in a much better way. I know I feel that way about relations there. I think our Secretary of [ORG] does. And still, I do not want to suggest we have no problems with [GPE] or any other country. But we can talk about them more frankly without the door being slammed. And that can help [GPE], that can help it. [INTERVIEWER1]. How do you see, [INTERVIEWED], your relation with so-called [NORP]-solution states? [INTERVIEWED]. Good, and better. It depends who you mean. [GPE] was an [NORP]-solution state, and I feel very respectful of and friendship toward His Majesty the King [[PERSON]]. I mean, that was not strained by this. You have got a problem if you are referring to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. The [GPE] incident. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, [GPE]. Let it cool down here, calm, take a little time. A little hurt feelings out there, disappointment in [GPE] still there; but a recognition that a stable [GPE] is in everybody's interests. And I do not want to I mean, a lot of what happened in the [GPE] situation was aimed not just against [GPE] but some of the other neighbors in the area. And when that happens, I'd like to know how they feel. I'd like to know how King [PERSON] or [PERSON] feels or how the [NORP]' [PERSON] feels about [GPE] and we can help. I mean, we have had a good relationship with the [NORP] King [[PERSON]]. But I have expressed my public disappointment because I think [GPE] has swung way over on this question. And I am not saying it was all his fault because there were some people out there in the streets. And they are still out there yelling about me, personally, and the whole [GPE]. Obviously I am just this target for that. But my view is, hey, we have all got to live together in peace, so let us take a little time now and sort this one out. We do not want to see a radicalized [GPE], and yet I must confess to a certain disappointment in terms of how that [NORP] question will I am disappointed with some of the [GPE] press, frankly, that did nothing but blame everything on [GPE]. They know better than that. And yet they did it. But I have learned in life maybe it is because I am [DATE] now take a little time, let it simmer, and then let us try to put together a more peaceful Middle East. So, I have no rancor or bitterness. But, again, there is an area let the [NORP] work their magic out here. You are talking about an [NORP] solution. Let them come to me and say, all of them, including [GPE]: Here is the way we ought to work together. And not us try to dictate, to say to King [PERSON], hey, you have got to do this. He would not do it anyway. He is a strong-willed person, knows the area. So, my answer: disappointment. Determination to think that [DATE] we will have a better relationship with a country with whom we have always had a good relationship, try to recognize their problems. But it is going to take time. There is some hurt here, some hurt in the neighborhood; there is some damage to a bilateral relationship. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], what is your message to the [NORP] people? [INTERVIEWED]. A positive signal to the [NORP] people and that our argument has never been with the [NORP] people, per se. And I hope that our participation in this coalition and, if I could move [CARDINAL] step forward, our leadership of the coalition was not aimed against an [NORP] of any kind. It was aimed in favor of a principle. And that principle, again: You do not take over your neighbor by force. So, I see some demonstrations in various countries against my country, and I have a hurt about that. I guess every [NORP] loves to be loved, you know, around the world. But it does not work that way. And yet, I think some of the accusations by fundamentalists against us are very untrue, and I will stand up against them. But I think the message, it should not be one of recrimination: Hey, we remember what you said; we are going to get even. It ought to be: Look, we tried to stand for what we think was decent and right. We tried to stand with respect for principles in the [NORP] world. We tried in the targeting of [GPE] to be respectful of their culture, archeological, religious, whatever. And our argument is not with [ORG]; our argument is not with [NORP]. And I will stand up against any discrimination against [NORP] in this country publicly, openly we have had groups in here and say, Damn it, we hurt when you hurt. But what we stood for was something positive. And I want to keep trying in every way possible to get that message across. And it was a positive point about which many [NORP] can rally. And I am not a student of religion, but I do not find anything in what the principal teachings of [ORG] that put us in contradiction at all. In fact, the principles are the same as what we have a diverse religious culture. But it is kindness, it is be good to your neighbor, it is love, and it is take care of children. It is all these things that so there is no [NORP]. There is no [NORP]. Our role is trying to be positive. And when it is said to me, The [NORP] world will turn against you, I never believed it for a minute. And I do not have any rancor when I see some. But if they assign motives to my country that are not correct, then I am going to fight, stand up, and say, wait [TIME], you are wrong. And we have got some healing to do, but we also have some convincing to do. [INTERVIEWER1]. By the way, [INTERVIEWED], [CARDINAL] of the relatives of the [NORP] soldiers was a [NORP], and he arrived in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. And President [PERSON] ordered a special flight to get him because all the [NORP] were buried in [GPE]. But he is a [NORP], he was buried in [GPE], and President [PERSON] sent up a private flight to get him back home. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], what is the most difficult moment you have been through since the crisis? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we had some difficult ones internally here. And [CARDINAL] of them was our press was saying I had not convinced the [NORP] people that what we were doing as an administration was right. And [PERSON] was in on that, General [PERSON], [PERSON] we were all in that together. [INTERVIEWED]. And then I'd say the [ORG]. It was argued I cannot go to war without the [ORG]. And I was saying, I have the authority to do this. We had lawyers. But once [ORG] acted affirmatively, it became much clearer to the [NORP] people. And so, that moment as we were getting down to a congressional vote was a very big one. I do not think we ever had any real fundamental differences with the [NORP] world once we started I mean, with the coalition. I am probably forgetting something, but I cannot remember exactly. [INTERVIEWER1]. How about the [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. The uncertainty of [DATE]. Well, the [NORP] stayed with us at the [ORG] And so, at the end, when they started saying here is a peace plan, we knew what we had to do. And I did not assign to them the motives that many of our countrymen did, that [PERSON] was playing mischief because he was being left out. I really think he wanted to stop short of more killing well, I am going to feel that way. Others disagree with me here. But I do not think it was ever a crisis because we knew what we had to do. [INTERVIEWER1]. I see. [INTERVIEWED]. Now, if he'd have stood up and said, if you do that we are going to blast you, and we are going to lead the Third World in opposition he could have done that. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. And he did not do that. So, it could have been a problem, but he conducted himself in that case very well. He tried for peace, what he thought was a fair peace, a peace within keeping of the [ORG] resolution. I was telling him: No, it is not, President [PERSON], it is not. Stops short; there are conditions. And we have come a long way; we cannot accept conditions. But it never got to be I would not say that one got to be it had a potential of a stumbling block, but it did not really get there. And then I guess the major, not bump in the road but decision on our part was, what happens when you commit your young people to war? How many are going to be killed? There was a picture in [ORG] magazine, [CARDINAL] graves dug. Argument in this country used against me, of us, was body bags. That is a horrible image to people across our country. You are going to put my son in a body bag to fight for a country halfway around the world? So, the actual commitment of force, whether it was first the air, then the ground, from the [GPE] standpoint was an important decision. Again, we knew we had to do this. We have committed to do this. But the timing presented a problem and all of that. But on balance, though, it went, I think, fairly smoothly. [INTERVIEWER1]. It is over. [INTERVIEWED]. It is over, thank God.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmonashazliegyptsdreamtv", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], it is not an easy thing to interview [INTERVIEWED] of the most powerful state on-in the world. However, what is more difficult is to size down your questions to fit in [TIME]. [INTERVIEWED]. In the timeframe. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Yes. My first question is, people in [GPE], sometimes they get confused. On [CARDINAL] hand, they hear the [GPE] statements, speeches that stress on the long-lasting relationships with [GPE], the strategic importance of [GPE] to the [GPE] and to the Middle East, [GPE] as the major player in the peace process. On the other hand, they could see indications that contradicts with this: [GPE] depending on other parties in the region, your snatching visit to [GPE] [DATE], the partial cutting of the [GPE] aid. How would you comment on that? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I would comment this, that from my perspective, the [NORP]-[GPE] relationship is a very important part of our [NORP] foreign policy, for these reasons: [CARDINAL], [GPE] has got a proud history and a great tradition, and a lot of people look to [GPE] for help. Now, [GPE] cannot solve a lot of problems on our own, has to have allies be a part of it. And so on the [NORP] issue, for example, [GPE] can be very constructive and has been constructive and helpful. [GPE] has got a society that honors diversity and gives people a chance to realize their talents, like you. I mean, you are a very smart, capable professional woman who has showed the rest of the Middle East what is possible in the Middle East. And [GPE] has been on the forefront of modernization. [GPE] is a-strategically located. And so our relationship is strong and good. We have had our differences-on elections, for example. But nevertheless, to answer your question, I would say the relationship is very solid and very important. [INTERVIEWER1]. Then how would you perceive the state of democracy in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I would say, fits and starts; good news and bad news. In other words, there is been some moments where it looked like [GPE] was going to continue to lead the Middle East on the democracy movement, and there is been some setbacks. But I guess that just reflects the nature of the administration and their-on the [CARDINAL] hand, their desire for democracy; on the other hand, their concerns about different movements. My view is, is that democracy is a powerful engine for reform and change and leads to peace. [INTERVIEWER1]. But the public opinion- sometimes they perceive the [GPE] criticism to the development of democracy in [GPE] as an unacceptable intervention in the internal affairs. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I can understand that. Look, nobody wants the big, influential guy to come from the outside and tell them what to do. I am sensitive to that. On the other hand, I do believe it is important for a leader in a country to adhere to certain values, universal values. I think the idea of giving people a chance to vote and a chance to participate freely in society is a universal value. And so it is -I try to balance, on the [CARDINAL] hand, my beliefs, and on the other hand, a friendship with the Government and friendship with President [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1]. It is a matter of [TIME], and you will be in [GPE] celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of [GPE]. This celebration might be perceived by [NORP] and [NORP] like- it is criticized, because it is ignoring the flip side, which is [DATE] of agony, pain, and struggle in the area, in the region. What would you tell [NORP] and [NORP] concerning this? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am going to talk to the [NORP] face to face when I come to [GPE]. And I will say that there is been [DATE] of struggling on both sides, and it is time that the struggle has got to end. And now for-is the time for the development of a [NORP] state that has got defined borders, that does not look like Swiss cheese; in other words, it is contiguous territory, where the refugee issue is dealt with. And that is what my message is, is that I am going to-I fully recognize the agony and pain that have been lived by everybody in the region, and that here is [CARDINAL] way forward. And it is a-and we will continue to work, and hopefully, by the end of my Presidency, we will get the definition of a state. And so I will talk to President [PERSON] about how we can work together. [INTERVIEWER1]. Is this-some people would consider this as getting the ceiling lower and lower. Before, you said this-your administration will witness the declaration of the [NORP] state. Now we are talking about only the definition of the state. [INTERVIEWED]. No, no, it is always been the definition, cause I always said that the state will not come into being until certain obligations are met through the roadmap. And so the whole purpose was to define- it is a semantical difference, but I really have not changed my position. [INTERVIEWER1]. Former President [PERSON] was in [GPE] [DATE], and he was really trying to tell how he was seeing things. He said with a simple comparison between the victims from the [NORP] side and the [NORP] side, you can see who is suffering more. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Well, everybody has got their opinions. I just happen to believe that I am in a position to help move the definition of a state, which will help solve the problem in the long run. I am the first President ever to have articulated a [CARDINAL]-state solution, [CARDINAL] states living side by side in peace. And my only thing I want to tell your listeners is that I am going to drive hard, along with Secretary [PERSON] and other people in my administration, to see if we cannot get the [NORP] and [NORP] to agree on what that state will look like. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], do you still believe that who is not with us is against us? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Yes, in the war on terror, I do. Yes. When you kill innocent people to achieve political objectives, I think they are against civilized people. We have witnessed this kind of ideological-- [INTERVIEWER1]. But [TIME], you said we have differences. We have-- [INTERVIEWED]. Of course, we have differences. [INTERVIEWER1]. --it is normal to have differences. [INTERVIEWED]. It is, but killing people to achieve political objectives is-it is [CARDINAL] thing to have differences of opinion, it is another thing to have differences of action. And my comments about that-what-the line you just quoted was in the context of dealing with these extremists, like [ORG] or [ORG], who just murder innocent people. And, yes, I still feel very strongly about that. Most people do not believe in using murder as a political tool. Most people want to live in peace, and so do I. [INTERVIEWER1]. I have only just a chance for [CARDINAL] question. [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. [INTERVIEWER1]. You will be in the region very soon: [GPE], [GPE], and then [GPE]. The question is, maybe there are [CARDINAL] [NORP] who think that President [PERSON] has added to their sufferings and problems during his administration. How would you adjudicate this? [INTERVIEWED]. I would just ask them to wait for history to answer the question. There is an advent of a young democracy in [GPE]. Ask those people what it is like to live under a freer society, rather than the thumb of a tyrant or a dictator; or the people that we are trying to help in [GPE] by getting the [NORP] out through a [ORG] resolution; or the [NORP] who-for whom I have articulated a state. In other words, I understand people's opinions. All I ask is that when history is finally recorded, judge whether or not I have been a contributor to peace or not. [INTERVIEWER1]. You think history will be in your side? [INTERVIEWED]. I think history will say, [PERSON] clearly saw the threats that keep the Middle East in turmoil and was willing to do something about it, was willing to lead, and had this great faith in the capacity of democracies and the great faith in the capacity of people to decide the fate of their countries; and that the democracy movement gained impetus and gained movement in the Middle East. Yes, I think people will say, Well, he had a difficult set of circumstances to deal with, and he dealt with them with a sense of idealism. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you for this interview. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, thanks for coming.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmonicamalpassactionnews", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], given the [CARDINAL] history of mistrust with [GPE], how can you be certain they will comply with this agreement and is it worth risking the relationship the [GPE] has with [GPE], since they are vehemently opposed? [INTERVIEWED]. Well I do not think that we can be certain that [GPE] will comply which is why we have set it up, so we can catch them if they cheat. But our central security priority here is to make sure [GPE] does not get a nuclear weapon. That would not just be dangerous for us, but it'd be dangerous for [GPE] and dangerous for the world. And almost every nuclear expert who is looked at this deal has been persuaded that in fact this is the best way for us to assure ourselves and the world that [GPE] will not get a nuclear weapon because we shut down a whole bunch of their facilities, they ship out in rich uranium that they already have and they do so for [DATE] period, they cannot introduce advanced centre fusions that could produce weapons grade material and that does not mean that suddenly we have a good relationship with [GPE]. It does mean that we have taken off the table what poses a game changer, a great threat to us and we have done so without initiating a new military conflict in the Middle East. And that, I think, is something that should be embraced by all sides, as it is by practically every country in the world. [INTERVIEWER1]. If [PERSON], the vice president, decides to run for president, it'll be tricky to decide who to support I assume between him and [PERSON], would you concede that it is easier for you if he does not run? [INTERVIEWED]. What I would say is that both are [PERSON] and [PERSON] are wonderful people, great friends. [PERSON]'s been as good a vice president as I think we have seen in [NORP] history and been at my side in every tough decision I have made. [PERSON] was [CARDINAL] of our best secretaries of state and helped work on a whole range of really important issues, including the [GPE] deal with the outsetsetting up the sanctions that put pressure on [GPE] that forced them to the table. So, you know, the truth is though is the great thing about [NORP] democracy is it is not up to me, I am just [CARDINAL] voter. It is going to be up to the [NORP] people. My job over [DATE] is to stay focused on creating jobs, making sure the economic recovery that is been taking place continues, dealing with big challenges like climate change and making sure that [GPE] does not get a nuclear weapon. [INTERVIEWER1]. Speaking of the economy, what would you say to hard working [NORP] who lost their jobs in [DATE], saw their 401Ks disintegrate for the most part, are just starting to feel like their recovering and [DATE] here we go a similar problem, a major economic correction. Is this the exception or the rule, can you do something actively about it? [INTERVIEWED]. Well you know, as a rule I do not count it on the stock market going up and down, that is the nature of these markets. I think its more important to look at the long term trend lines that we have seen. I mean we have had [DATE] now of private sector job growth [DATE], [CARDINAL] jobs created. And, you know, the [NORP] economy has actually proved to be more resilient, come back faster better, stronger than any of the advanced countries around the world, whether it is Europe, [GPE], [GPE]. And I think that is a testimony to some good decisions that we have made, but in order to continue that progress, it is important that [ORG] does not stand in the way. And there are a couple things they are gonna need to do to continue economic progress. Number [CARDINAL], make sure that we pass a budget without shutting down the government, making sure that we do not have mindless cuts to critical areas like infrastructure and education, not screwing around with the debt limit like they did [DATE] that caused all kinds of chaos and panic. As long as we stay focused on our fundamentals, doing what we know works, then the [NORP] economy will continue to grow will continue to improve. And then we have got to make sure that our workers, our people, our children are trained for those jobs in the future and that is why education, job training, things like that are so important and why we cannot neglect those investments either. [INTERVIEWER1]. We have had another violent incident [DATE] that was deadly in [GPE]. It is been [DATE] and [DATE] in the [GPE] from rogue gunmen. What else will you be doing with gun control to stop this violence? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I have said in the past, it breaks my heart every time when you read about or hear about these kinds of incidents. Obviously the current investigation is still taking place. What we know is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism. We are willing to spend [MONEY] to prevent terrorist activities but we have not been willing, so far at least, to impose some common sense gun safety measures that could save some lives. And right now [ORG] is bottlenecked in it but you are seeing state legislators and cities take action in some places and I hope that that grass roots movements to say that people can, you know, have guns for hunting and for protection but that we can also have some common sense rules like background checks. That those things will make a difference, my hope is that public pressure continues to grow. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmouafacharbthemiddleeasttelevisionnetwork", "text": "[PERSON] [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for supporting our channel and our initiative. We will make sure on our channel, your policy, the point of view of your administration, will always be presented clearly and in fair context. However, we will make sure-we want to be a model for the free press, the [NORP] tradition- other point of views, relevant ones, will always be there, even if they are critical of you. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I understand that. I hope so. First of all, I appreciate your willingness to allow the people in the Middle East to hear my views. My views are one that speaks to freedom. I believe the Almighty God's gift to every person in the world is freedom, and I work for free societies because I believe in people. I want people to know that I respect religion. I am a religious man, myself. I respect the religion of other people as well. I believe we pray to the same Almighty God. I want people to know that I believe in peace. I want there to be peace. I also want people to know that it is very important for us to work together to fight terror, to fight those who would be willing to kill innocent lives in order to foster their own personal agendas. I appreciate that. I also do not mind people expressing opinions other than mine. I expect that to happen. It happens here in [GPE], and I expect it to happen around the world. [INTERVIEWED]. You may be the only world leader [DATE], and maybe the first [NORP] President, to pay a lot of attention to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. Why is that? Are you so committed to that? [INTERVIEWED]. I am very committed to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. I believe people can self-govern around the world. Now, there are some, admittedly, say, Well, they cannot have freedom and democracy in the Middle East. But I think that point of view is condescending. I think it diminishes the hopes and aspirations of the citizenry of the Middle East. I absolutely believe in freedom and peace, and I look forward to working with governments to achieve freedom and peace. Now, I recognize not every government is going to fashion a free society in the vision of [GPE]. I do not expect that, but I do expect every government to uphold the aspirations of the average citizens in a free society. [INTERVIEWED]. You mentioned in the State of the Union Address that you would be doubling the budget for [ORG] towards the Middle East. What is your vision? How are you trying to accomplish that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we need to work with governments and institutions and [ORG] to encourage the institutions of a free society. See, one of the interesting things in [FAC]-I love to bring people into [FAC], right around the corner from here, and say, This is where I office, but I want you to know the office is always bigger than the person. In other words, free societies are societies where people come and go, but the institutions that protect the rights of people never leave. And that is what the institute is going to be working on, free press, just like we just talked about, free elections, free society. [INTERVIEWED]. You said you would be working with governments in the Middle East. [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. [INTERVIEWED]. And you know the type of governments that now exist in the Middle East, and for how long the [GPE] has been accused of playing ball with governments that people hate. When you say you want this strategy, forward strategy of freedom, are you saying you are going to be abandoning the monarchies and, you know, those guys? [INTERVIEWED]. No, of course not. I know them well. First of all, many of the countries in the Middle East are modernizing. And that is what I look for. I fully understand it takes time for free societies, truly free societies to evolve. I do not expect instant success. After all, in my own country it took a while for our current system to evolve. Take [GPE], for example. First of all, I respect Crown Prince [PERSON] and like Crown Prince [PERSON]. He is a man of great faith and great integrity who gave a speech [DATE] about the need to modernize and to reform [NORP] society. I take him for his word. To me that was a positive development. King [PERSON] of [GPE], the King of [GPE], I mean, there is a series of places-[GPE], [GPE]-I mean, places that are developing-[GPE]-they are all developing the habits of free societies. They evolve differently. But nevertheless, progress is being made. And for that, I am very grateful. [INTERVIEWED]. When you sit down with the leaders of the countries you just mentioned, [INTERVIEWED], do you get a sense of the urgency, when we talk about the issues of reform and democracy, from them? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I get a sense of [CARDINAL] things from them. [CARDINAL], I do believe they understand the need to reform. But I also know they agree that we need to continue to work together to fight terror. And that is vital, because it is hard for a free society to develop with terrorists killing innocent people. For example, I have a vision in the Middle East for there to be a [NORP] state. I am the first [INTERVIEWED] to have ever articulated a [NORP] state. I believe there needs to be a [NORP] state, and I am not going to change my opinion. On the other hand, I know how hard it is to achieve a [NORP] state so long as there is groups of terrorists willing to murder in order to prevent that from happening. And so I hear [CARDINAL] things. I hear, [CARDINAL], the need to reform, to include more people in the process which is taking place, but also the clear understanding from leaders that we must continue to work together to fight off the terrorists. And I say this with conviction. There is a-the murderous ambitions of a few are trying to derail the hopes of many. And my Government wants to work with governments to prevent that from happening. [INTERVIEWED]. Has the roadmap failed? Do we need a new approach to revive the peace talks and work towards your vision? [INTERVIEWED]. No, not at all, no. The roadmap is in place. What has failed is the-some parties are not advancing on the roadmap. They are stuck. And I stood up with Mr. [PERSON], at that time the Prime Minister of [ORG], with Prime Minister [PERSON], in [GPE], [GPE]-and King [PERSON], of course, our host-and we linked arms and said, Let us move forward on the roadmap to peace. There needs to be a commitment to fight terror. There needs to be a commitment to put the institutions of a free society in place. There needs to be a commitment on the [NORP] to worry about the plight of the average [NORP] citizen-to encourage a society to evolve that is commercially viable and free. There needs to be a commitment from the neighborhood to help fight off the flow of funds to fund the terrorist groups, that would stop. And we were making progress. We really were, and then he got shoved aside. And so the roadmap is still intact. The vision for where we need to go is intact. What we need right now are parties who are willing to take a risk for peace and to lead. And I look forward to working with any such party. [INTERVIEWED]. Why then are some people in the [GPE] or some of your friends and allies in the Middle East say that you are not personally doing enough? How would you respond to that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would remind them of the pictures of [GPE], [GPE]. I mean, it is -it is a rare occurrence when [INTERVIEWED] stands up with [GPE], [ORG], and says, We are linked together to move toward peace. The problem was, was that somebody undermined that peace process by making it very difficult for Prime Minister [PERSON] to work to achieve his vision. And that somebody was Chairman [PERSON]. I am sorry that happened. On the other hand, I still believe that a [NORP] state is essential for the aspirations of the [NORP] people. And I fully understand there needs to be a firm commitment to fight off terror in order for that to happen. [INTERVIEWED]. On the issue of [GPE], how do you see the transition of sovereignty to the [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. Moving. I mean, if you really take a step back, we are here in [DATE], and the [NORP] people were not really liberated until [DATE]. We have not been there [DATE]. And yet, there is tremendous progress being made. The first thing I pay attention to-there are voices speaking out about how to achieve democracy. Had those voices spoken out [DATE] or [DATE] or [DATE], they probably would not be a voice anymore, given the fact that [PERSON] was willing to torture and kill dissidents. And [DATE], a free society is emerging. And it may look bumpy at times, but democracy sometimes looks bumpy. I mean, here in our own country I am sure people take a step back and say, What is happening in the election process? I mean, it looks like there are some sharp elbows. But I am encouraged by what is taking place in [GPE]. I appreciate so very much the fact that the [NORP] speak out for freedom. I appreciate the fact that the [NORP] are questioning whether or not they have a role in the future of their country. I appreciate the fact that the [NORP] are active. I appreciate the fact that all [CARDINAL] parties are trying to work for a common law that guarantees the religious rights of others, the minority rights of people in a free society. So I think it is very positive. We look forward to working with [ORG] to help the process along, to add some international legitimacy to what the [NORP] think is necessary to move the process toward a new constitution and elections of people. [INTERVIEWED]. From the outside, it looked like [PERSON] in [GPE], he is a religious man, he is calling for immediate elections, and we are kind of hesitant to do it right now. What is your reaction to that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that is very interesting. No, I understanding completely. First of all, I admire the fact that he is confident enough in democracy to call for elections. I mean, after all, [GPE] believes in elections. I think the only hesitancy from the experts is whether or not the process is ready to absorb direct elections. And we want to work with Mr. [PERSON], the [ORG]. He is a wise man. He is a distinguished gentleman who cares deeply about the [NORP] people. And I am confident we can work toward a solution that is in [GPE]'s interest and, at the same time, addresses his deep desire to have the people of [GPE] participate in the process. I think the fact that he is willing to be involved is a very positive development. It shows people care about the future of [GPE]. We just must all work together to come up with an [NORP] solution as to how best to get a constitution written and then direct elections. The first step, of course, is a general law and then a temporary assembly of some kind to help-so we can hand over sovereignty. And then the process moves forward. [INTERVIEWED]. If we can move towards [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. [INTERVIEWED]. You had a couple of phone calls with the [NORP] President after [DATE], and things looked, you know, that [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] was going in the right direction, according to your administration. And then things went sour. What happened? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think we made some legitimate requests. I said, Look, [ORG] is a terrorist organization. They headquartered in your country. You need to shut down those headquarters. You need to prevent terrorist activities from being planned and/or orders being-emanating out of [GPE]. Secondly, you have got to work on the border to make sure that the border between [GPE] and [GPE] is not porous, but, in fact, you are able to stop the flow of people and contraband and information back and forth. We do not want terrorists coming in from [GPE] into [GPE] to kill innocent [NORP] and/or [NORP] troops. And it is very important for us to keep sending that message to him. That is why I appreciate doing this interview. The message still stands. And we would hope there would be a strong cooperation on these very reasonable points. [INTERVIEWED]. The [NORP] President sent a couple of signals recently expressing his willingness to resume peace talks with [GPE]. Would you be willing-how do you assess this-- [INTERVIEWED]. It is very interesting. First of all, I am interested in peace. And the fact that a party is willing to talk about peace is, I think, a positive signal. I look forward to understanding fully what that means. As you know, there was-some progress had been made prior to my arrival as President on [NORP]-Israeli peace talks. And we have just got to understand the intent, the sincerity, and the desire of both parties involved-that would be [GPE] and [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. Although some people, maybe in [GPE], and you may consider what happened with [GPE] as a success for diplomacy, but it did not sit well with the [NORP]. It looks like it contradicts this forward strategy of freedom. [INTERVIEWED]. How do you mean it did not sit well with them? It sat well with Colonel [PERSON] because he made the decision. [INTERVIEWED]. But in terms of democracy, I mean, you know, [PERSON] is a dictator-- [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, whether or not democracy then follows-I see. Well, we hope it does, of course, and we look forward to working with him. But first things first. We had no relationship with [GPE], and now the relationship can improve because he has made a very wise decision to disclose programs and dismantle those programs. To me, it is a signal that Colonel [PERSON] is interested in a peaceful-is interested in peace and a resumption of relations with a country like [GPE], and that will begin to change the relationship. Right now we want to make sure that we all fulfill our obligations. And a key obligation is for [GPE] and [GPE] and the [ORG] to work with the [NORP] to fully disclose and dismantle, in a transparent way, weapons programs. [INTERVIEWED]. Would it be safe to say that [GPE] would not fully normalize with [GPE] unless the human rights record of [ORG] were to improve-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, there is a lot of conditionality in any relationship. We do want to improve relationships with [GPE], but the first thing-the first step, of course, is for the Colonel to fulfill his commitment to the entire world, and that is to disclose and dismantle. And then the relationship will evolve. [INTERVIEWED]. On the issue of weapons of mass destruction-[GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. [GPE] is a case where diplomacy worked. [GPE] is a place where-- [INTERVIEWED]. Diplomacy did not work. [INTERVIEWED]. --did not work. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it did not work. It was tried for [DATE], and it did not work. And the world continually said, Disarm, and he did not do it. And finally, I went to [ORG] and said to [ORG], For your sake and for our sake-you, [ORG] sake-for our sake, [GPE], and for the world's sake, let us enforce these resolutions. [INTERVIEWED]. So we have got the [NORP] model, and we have got the [NORP] model. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. Which one would fit [GPE] [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. All models must start with a strong effort by the world community to convince people to abandon-in this case, abandon programs, nuclear weapons programs. And we certainly hope the [NORP] situation can be resolved diplomatically. I appreciate very much the fact that members of [ORG] have spoken with one voice about the need for [GPE] * to fully disclose and disarm its weapons programs, and [ORG] is very much involved. So, in other words, we are now early in the stage, obviously, and it is a stage where I am hopeful that diplomacy will work. [INTERVIEWED]. You mentioned the international community. Are you satisfied with the way the international community is reacting towards the rebuilding of [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I really am. I mean, gosh, there is a lot of countries that are very much involved in [GPE]. [TIME] in the State of the Union, I began to read off the list. And the longer the list got, the more the [NORP] people begin to realize this is a truly internationalized effort. And people are contributing money. I mean, I was talking about forces on the ground, and the level of contributions are very generous-starting with [GPE], I might add. And I am most proud of the [ORG] for being willing to help rebuild [GPE], because they understand, like I understand, that a free [GPE] is going to be an agent of change in a positive way in the Middle East. Again, I want to go back to where we began. See, if you did not believe certain countries in the Middle East could be free, then you would not be worried about rebuilding of a country. But I believe they can be free, and I know free societies are peaceful societies. And I believe in the [NORP] people of all walks of life, and I believe that they are going to show the world what is possible. After all, the [NORP] people have such a- [NORP] history is so rich. The culture of [GPE] is fantastic. And it is -I have visions of a university system that really leads the Middle East in education and on the forefront of science and engineering, because I know the [NORP] [NORP] who are here, very bright, capable, honorable people who have come to our country, realized the benefits of freedom, taken advantage of some fantastic opportunities, and made great citizens. Well, the same thing is going to happen in [GPE]. And that will cause others to say, Well, gosh, if it is happening in [GPE], let us follow that model of a free society. And [ORG] understands that. I understand that. And a lot of people around the world understand it. And I am grateful for the contributions that people are willing to make for the reconstruction of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Are you concerned that [GPE]'s neighbors may work to undermine the democracy because it does not suit the region? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is an interesting question. I certainly hope not. But if-look, [CARDINAL] of the neighbors to [GPE] is [GPE]. And they withstood any pressure, if there was any pressure, to undermine the development of a free and secular society. They still maintain its respect for [ORG]. [GPE] is another country which is evolving, showing what is possible in terms of a free society and an active [ORG] and, at the same time, honoring [ORG]. No, I think a truly free society will resist foreign efforts to undermine the development of that society. [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], this is [DATE] for you. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. If, hypothetically, people in the Middle East could vote, would [DATE] be-if you were to be elected- would be good for them? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, absolutely. [INTERVIEWED]. Why would they vote for you? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. Well, they'd vote for me because I am strong on the war on terror, for starters. I refuse to relent to terrorist groups. There is no negotiation with these people. These are people that are willing to kill people who are devout, religious people, and not care about it. They kill innocent women and children and not care about it. More [NORP] have died at the hands of killers than-I say more [NORP]-a lot of [NORP] have died-I do not know the exact count-at [GPE]. Look at these different places around the world where there is been tremendous death and destruction because killers kill. They would appreciate [PERSON] in the future because I understand that freedom and prosperity go hand in hand. And a free society is more likely to be a prosperous society where people can realize their hopes and aspirations. Listen, I am a dad. I love my girls more than anything in life, our daughters. I know that other dads feel the same way about their children, and all they want is for their children to have a chance to succeed, to grow up in a peaceful society, to be well-educated, and to realize their God-given potential. I share that dream. I think the people of the Middle East will see that the [PERSON] administration is unrelenting when it comes to dealing with the few who want to hurt the many but, at the same time, believes in the people of the Middle East, believes in their hopes and aspirations. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersalarabiyanewschannel", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for your time. [INTERVIEWED]. It is great to be with you. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. You concluded the summit. Was it successful? Were there any sticking points that either you or your government did not achieve? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it was very successful. And the intentions here were to deepen and broaden what is already an excellent relationship between the [ORG] countries and [GPE]. Obviously, we have a whole range of bilateral security arrangements with the various [ORG] countries. We have consulted and worked with them on a range of regional challenges. But I thought the time was ripe for us to be able to come together as a group, to talk face-to-face about a wide range of these issues, and then to put forward very specific plans in terms of how we can address them. So the joint statement that we issued I think reflected the wide range of topics that were discussed. We discussed the important security assurances that I had delivered publicly in venues like [ORG] and had discussed privately, but I think it was important for them, at a time when there is so much chaos in the region, for the [ORG] members to hear that [GPE] is committed, if they are subject to external attack or the threat of attack, to work with the [ORG] to deter such attacks and to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the [ORG] countries. We also talked about the joint work that we have to do to counter violent extremism in a whole range of areas, from ending the financing of terrorist organizations to improving intelligence, to what kinds of capabilities-for example, maritime security or cyber security-that are needed. And some of these areas are ones where it is better if we do them together in integrated fashion. And we discussed [GPE] and why it is my firm belief that [GPE] cannot get a nuclear weapon and that the best way to achieve it is if we are able to accomplish a verifiable deal. But what I wanted to emphasize, because I think there is been concerns in the region about [GPE]'s destabilizing activities, is that even if we get a deal on the nuclear issue we are still concerned with some of those activities by not only [GPE] and [ORG] and the [ORG], but also proxies like [ORG]. And so I reaffirmed with them the interest in working to strengthen their defenses, strengthen our joint positions, and then hopefully we will be in a position of strength in terms of expressing to the [NORP] a desire for good relations, but also a insistence that they stop with some of those activities. So, overall, I thought it was very successful. And the best part about it was there was a very frank and honest conversation, the kind that you can only have when you are face to face. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. I am going to pin you down on a few of the points that you just mentioned. When you said that you would use military power to protect your ally, what does that mean? I mean, what are you going to- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I think that we have seen in the past what happened in [GPE] when [PERSON] invaded. I think it is [GPE] policy that in the Gulf, because of the wide range of interests and the deep friendship and security relations that we have with those countries, that if there was an external threat, our military would be working with the [ORG], and hopefully a broad range of other international actors, to prevent that kind of violation of the basic norms of international behavior. I think that there are concerns among some of the [ORG] members in how do we deal with not the traditional conventional threats, but asymmetric threats-terrorist activity, or the financing of violent activities in various countries' borders. And part of the point that I made to them is that those kinds of asymmetric threats are best dealt with through increasing capacity of training special forces, improving the interdiction of arms flowing in, better intelligence cooperation. So some of the issues that we discussed had to do with very traditional military issues. And we will be extending additional exercises, as I said, trying to help them evaluate where various [ORG] members are weaker and where they are stronger in their defense capabilities on, let us say, ballistic missile defense, for example. But some of these are less traditional issues that have to be addressed-how do we identify potential terrorist activity that may be taking place? How do we distinguish that from legitimate political activities that are taking place? I think those are issues that we will continue to work on. And the goal here is not that we have solved all these problems- [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. - in [CARDINAL] day-and-a-half summit, but rather that we created a framework, a set of intentions, and now we have a series of steps that we are going to have to take through our foreign ministers, our defense ministers, and they will be reporting back to us [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. -so that when we meet again [DATE] we will be able to see the progress that is been made. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. But in this case, why cannot you give them a written agreement to reinforce the [PERSON] understanding? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the statement is a written agreement. If you are asking why not provide a formal treaty, the truth of the matter is, is that the treaty process is very cumbersome, requires- [INTERVIEWER1]. [ORG] approval. [INTERVIEWED]. -congressional approval, and it is not necessary in this situation in order for us to be able to accomplish the goals that we wanted to meet. [INTERVIEWER1]. I see. As you know, as you mentioned, it is a great concern about [GPE]'s activities-in [GPE], in [GPE], in [GPE], and all of these [NORP] countries. And it is equal to kind of the worry from the nuclear threat for most [NORP] countries. Yet, the security arrangement that you have talked about does not address this. Does it? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, actually it does, in the sense that when we talk about the need for us to have joint capabilities to address destabilizing activities and conflicts in the region, some of those are directly related to the concerns surrounding [GPE]. And that was- [INTERVIEWER1]. Can you give me an example? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, a very good example is making sure that [GPE] is not pouring in arms to [NORP] inside of [GPE]. Obviously, there is a long history of political instability inside of [GPE]. And the [NORP] have their own indigenous history inside of [GPE]. But if the [ORG] is sending significant weapons into [GPE] right on the [NORP] border, that becomes then a source of concern. And part of our goal here is to make sure that we are able to identify these problems, to highlight them, and then to deter them. And that was a major topic of discussion throughout the summit. Keep in mind that [GPE] has been very clear that a nuclear-armed [GPE] would be potentially even more reckless and dangerous. And so it is in everyone's interest to ensure that [GPE] does not have a nuclear weapon and that we provide a pathway for [GPE] to engage in positive behavior-in commerce, in trade, in education, in scientific exchange. That is the path that we hope they take. But I have been very clear that just because we are able to resolve the nuclear issue does not negate the very real problems that we have had with their past state sponsorship of terrorism, with the potential for mischief in the region. And that is something that we will continue to address- [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. -jointly with our [ORG] partners. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. So will we see an increased military-[GPE] military presence in the area of the Gulf, for example, on the Red Sea, around the Red Sea? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, the truth is that our military presence there is extremely robust. And we have [CARDINAL] of ships-or [CARDINAL] of troops. We have [ORG]. Our military assets in the region are very significant and ready to respond to a whole range of contingencies. And in addition, the [ORG] countries have significant capabilities, as well. [CARDINAL] of the things that we discussed was that the issue is not necessarily if we have enough military hardware, but are we using it properly? Are we coordinating it properly? Are we identifying the right tools for the specific challenges that we have [DATE]? [INTERVIEWER1]. On the deal with [GPE], some say it is a political gamble to have this deal because [DATE] is a short period. And if they are going to use this money from the sanction relief to better the life of the [NORP] people, it is kind of a wishful strategy. How do you respond to that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think it is a wishful strategy. The sanctions that we have imposed have been a brutal- [INTERVIEWER1]. No, but I mean the money they are going to have- [INTERVIEWED]. -imposition of costs on [GPE]. So when they receive money, they are going to have to do things just to shore up their economy, which has collapsed drastically during the course of my administration and the international sanctions that we have imposed. So what is true is that we cannot simply trust the [NORP] to abide by a deal. It has to be verifiable. And so part of what we did during this summit was to lay out the unprecedented steps to verify and inspect and monitor nuclear activity inside of [GPE]. And under the framework that we are now trying to memorialize, [GPE] would be subject to the kinds of inspections that have never been put in place before. So we are confident that we can cut off the [CARDINAL] pathways to [GPE] getting a nuclear weapon. And that verification process does not extend simply [DATE], or [DATE]; it extends for a very, very long period of time. The first phase-for [DATE]-they would be severely restricted in their activities around any kind of nuclear power. In [DATE], they would still be under the inspections regime that we are discussing, but they would be able to do more around peaceful nuclear power. And so they would have to, essentially, earn-re-earn the trust of the international community around these issues. The alternative is to not have any idea what is taking place inside of [GPE]. And that, I think, is a much more dangerous situation for everyone in the region. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. Let me just ask you this. Often you talk about [GPE] with admiration and you always praise the [NORP] people. But somehow it is perceived in the region that you are putting down [NORP], that somehow you link them to extremists. And I just want you to correct this, if this is the case, because that is the impression. [INTERVIEWED]. I think that would be a mistaken impression so [ORG] is going to have to do a better job delivering my message. Our closest friends in the region are the Gulf countries, and that relationship dates back for [DATE] now. And when I have spoken directly to the [NORP] people, essentially what I have said to them is, you have the opportunity to restore traditions that would allow you to be a full-fledged and admired member of the international community. I want to encourage that. But I have been extraordinarily critical of the [NORP] regime's ideology and the approach that they have taken to international affairs, as well as how they have dealt with their own people. So what is true-and this was a topic of discussion-is that given the extraordinary history of the Gulf countries and the culture, and the fact that, for example, [GPE] is the guardian of and the foundation stone for so much in the [NORP] tradition and [NORP] heritage-including, of course [GPE] and [GPE]-that we do have to work together to make sure that youth in not just Gulf countries, but places like [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]-that they feel a sense of opportunity, and that we are not allowing them to be recruited into organizations like- [INTERVIEWER1]. [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. -Daesh and previously [ORG] that lead to a dead-end. And that is as significant a danger as any that are faced by the [ORG] countries. If that continues, then that can end up being a cancer that eats away at the great nation states and traditions inside of the Gulf. And I think we have to be honest about that, and I have had very straightforward conversations about that. This is something that all the [ORG] members agree-which is why part of our emphasis during this summit was not just weapons and strategies. It was also how do we encourage entrepreneurship- [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. - through things like the Global Entrepreneurship Forum that we have initiated? How do we use social media so that we are reaching young people with a positive message that is as effective and as rapid as the use that [ORG] is making of social media, that [ORG] is making of social media? So these are also part of the cooperation that we want to try to bring about over [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. Talking of young leadership, you met with Crown Prince [PERSON] and Deputy Crown Prince [PERSON] here. What is your assessment of the young leadership of [GPE]? And also you met the King himself. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. This is a new transition in the [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, we have extraordinary respect for His Majesty and his leadership. I had a great relationship with King [PERSON], who is deeply missed. And [PERSON] has been a partner with us on counterterrorism work and security work for a very long time. [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. So we have great admiration for him. This is the first time that we had had a chance to work closely with the Deputy Crown Prince, and I think he struck us as extremely knowledgeable, very smart, I think wise beyond [DATE]. And throughout the Gulf, what you are seeing I think is more young leadership moving into positions of authority and decision-making. And I think that is a positive thing. When I came in, I was a relatively young man, as President. [INTERVIEWER1]. Still are. [INTERVIEWED]. I am not as young now. I have got some gray hair. But the world moves so quickly now and is so sophisticated, and there is so much information that is having to be processed, that for us to be able to see that next generation move in, in an effective and decisive way I think will ultimately be very good for a region of the world that is young. [INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah. [INTERVIEWED]. The truth is, is that the Gulf countries, and the Middle East and North Africa generally, those populations are all extraordinarily young. And we have to be able to speak and reach to those young people, and to adapt to the new circumstances of [DATE]'s world. [INTERVIEWER1]. My time is running out, but I want to ask you about [GPE] and [GPE], quickly. Many people believe that [GPE] is your [GPE]. It might haunt you for [DATE] to come-200, [CARDINAL] dead; [CARDINAL] people displaced; the worse humanitarian crisis in [DATE]. Are we going to see the end of all bloodshed before you leave office, [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. I will be honest, probably not. Because the situation in [GPE] is heartbreaking, but it is extremely complex. And I am haunted by the hardships and the deaths. It is something I take very seriously. But when the analogy is used of [GPE] it presumes that some sort of swift [GPE] intervention would have prevented these problems. You have a civil war in a country that arises out of long-standing grievances. It was not something that was triggered by [GPE]; it was not something that could have been stopped by [GPE]. And [CARDINAL] of the things that I have said in this summit-and I was very blunt-is that all too often, I think in the Middle East region, people attribute everything to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. True. [INTERVIEWED]. There are conspiracy theories everywhere. [INTERVIEWER1]. True. [INTERVIEWED]. If something wrong happens, well, it must be [GPE]. If something -- [INTERVIEWER1]. They look to the [GPE] for leadership. [INTERVIEWED]. -if something-if we did something, then why did not [GPE] meddle in our affairs. If we do not do something, then, well, why is not [GPE] doing something. I think that is a common theme. And I was very frank with the [ORG] leaders. I said, look, we are partners; we can do these things together. But [GPE] ultimately can only work through [NORP] countries who are also working on their own behalf to deal with these issues. And part of our goal here is to build capacity. This is why in [GPE], for example, I have been fully prepared to support a legitimate, constitutionally appropriate [NORP] government. But what I have said is we will work through the [NORP] government and the [NORP] military and we will support them. And in [GPE], our efforts have to be as part of a broader international coalition, and ultimately a military solution is not going to be the solution. If [GPE] simply sent in troops into [GPE]-our military is very effective, and for a short period of time, we potentially could come down on the side of the opposition against [PERSON]. But in terms of governance, in terms of keeping the peace, in terms of working through some of the sectarian issues that have plagued that country as well as the region for such a long time, those would still be there. And so we are prepared to work not just with the [ORG], but with countries like [GPE]-which has a very powerful military, are right on the border. They have got [CARDINAL] people who they have very generously, I think, accepted from [GPE]. But ultimately, it makes more sense for us to work with them, rather than unilaterally- [INTERVIEWER1]. Sure [INTERVIEWED]. -in order to resolve what is a very serious humanitarian issue. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sure but, forgive me, [INTERVIEWED], when people rise and they demand their rights, they look up to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. They do not look to any other country. And especially after President [PERSON] used chemical weapons, people felt they have been let down. The civil war did not start from [DATE]. They felt that you could have done something in the beginning and you did not . [INTERVIEWED]. But if you look at the history of the process, essentially what they are arguing is that we should have invaded [GPE] and overthrown the [NORP] regime-which, by the way, would be a violation of international law, and undoubtedly we would then be criticized for that, as well. And so what I think we have tried to do is be very clear about principles, what we believe in. With respect to the chemical weapons issue, my principle was that chemical weapons should not be used. People may criticize us for not having launched missiles against [PERSON] after chemical weapons had been used, but keep in mind why we did not . We did not because they got rid of their chemical weapons. And that, in fact, was very important. It did not solve barrel bombs. It did not solve the incredible hardships that all the [NORP] people are going through. But to solve those larger problems, that requires the kind of international work in which we are obviously a very significant part and a very significant partner-and my Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], has been tireless in trying to arrive at a diplomatic solution to this problem. Part of the problem we also have is that on the other side inside of [GPE], we have extremists who may be opposed to [PERSON] but also deeply opposed to [GPE], are deeply opposed to the [ORG] countries; are interested in establishing a very destructive order and have engaged in the same kinds of brutality and violence that we do not want to see deeply entrenched. So these are difficult times. These are difficult challenges. What I am optimistic about is that the [ORG] countries represent stability and also I think an awareness of the need for us to be able to move together and create the framework so that young people-instead of being attracted to violence, or not being able to go to school, or being victims in the crossfire of civil war-are able to live peacefully. And I think they also understand the need for us to move beyond the sectarianism that is being fanned by extremists who just want power and use that as an excuse. [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] last question. I was told it is over. You are the second President I am interviewing who is leaving office without realizing the vision of a [NORP] state. You had serious efforts in the first and second administration. Yet we receive-we reached a dead-end. Why? Who is responsible for that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, this is a very difficult challenge. On the [CARDINAL] hand, I am a deep and strong supporter of [GPE], and the connection between [GPE] and [GPE] is obviously powerful. And [GPE] has legitimate security concerns. There is no doubt about it. And what is also true is I am deeply committed to a [NORP] state. You know, in my visits to places like [GPE], when I talk to young [NORP] students and I hear their sense that their world is shut off because of their circumstances in [GPE], or when I hear some of the heartbreaking stories in [GPE], the only solution to me over the long term is a [CARDINAL]-state solution. And we worked very hard, but, frankly, the politics inside of [GPE] and the politics among the [NORP], as well, made it very difficult for each side to trust each other enough to make that leap. And what I think at this point, realistically, we can do is to try to rebuild trust-not through a big overarching deal, which I do not think is probably possible in [DATE], given the makeup of the [PERSON] government, given the challenges I think that exist for President [PERSON]-but if we can start building some trust around, for example, relieving the humanitarian suffering inside of [GPE] and helping the ordinary people in [GPE] to recover from the devastation that happened [DATE]; if we can do more to create business opportunities and jobs inside the territories-if we can slowly rebuild that kind of trust, then I continue to believe that the logic of a [CARDINAL]-state solution will reassert itself. Because I have said to the [NORP] you cannot remain a state that is both a democracy and [NORP] if you continue to have this problem unresolved. And with respect to the [NORP], I have said that you cannot expect to have a state of your own and the full dignity and respect that is inherent for all human beings if you also do not recognize [GPE], because [GPE] is not going anywhere. And I think that people of goodwill on both sides understand that. Unfortunately, the politics of fear has been stronger than the politics of hope over [DATE]-partly because of the chaotic situation in the region overall. And it is going to take some time to rebuild it. But as I said [DATE] at [FAC], nobody would have imagined that [GPE] and [GPE] would remain at peace for decades- [INTERVIEWER1]. Right. [INTERVIEWED]. - until finally leadership seized [DATE]. And [GPE] wants to be a strong partner in this. We cannot do it for the [NORP] or the [NORP]. But we can continue to push for what we believe is the truth and what we believe is right. [INTERVIEWER1]. So no meeting between [PERSON] and [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you never say never. So we will see how it unfolds. But the [GPE]'s commitment to both a secure [GPE] and a sovereign [NORP] state, that remains our policy. [INTERVIEWER1]. I have other questions about [GPE] and [GPE], but time is running out. So thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWER1]. I really appreciate it. [INTERVIEWED]. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersmbctv", "text": "About [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], nice to see you always. [INTERVIEWED]. Welcome, welcome. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. We are glad you are here. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWED]. Come on in to [FAC]. [INTERVIEWER1]. We are grateful for this. Thank you. This is great. [INTERVIEWED]. It is an interesting history here, and I kind of think [CARDINAL] thing that your viewers might be interested in knowing is that the first decision I ever made as President-but I was actually Presidentelect-was, what color rug do you want? And one of the important things is to surround yourself with people who you can trust and delegate. In this case, I delegated the rug design to [PERSON], my wife. But I told her, I said, I want the rug to have a message, and that is optimistic guy goes to work here. And so, as you can see, the rug really lights up the room. And I am optimistic about the future of the Middle East. [INTERVIEWER1]. Well, that is a great note, sir. You have been here [DATE]. [DATE] and you are going to be leaving. [INTERVIEWED]. I am going home. [INTERVIEWER1]. You sat on this desk for [DATE], and you took many decisions regarding our region. You launched the greater Middle East initiative that you want to democratize, reform the Middle East. In retrospect, do you think that vision was realized? Would you do anything differently? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it began- it is the beginning of a very difficult vision to implement. But I felt it was necessary for a couple of important reasons. [CARDINAL], I believe we are in an ideological struggle against people who want to achieve their ideological vision through the use of violence and murder. And I believe it is essential that you have an alternative available for people; the one I happen to believe in is based upon liberty. I do not think this is an [NORP] vision, see. And I tell people this, that I do believe there is a universal God, and a gift of that Almighty to all of us, whether we be [NORP] or [NORP] or nothing, is freedom. And so freedom is a great alternative. But I also believe there is a moral calling. If you believe there is an Almighty God, and a gift of that Almighty to everybody is freedom, then I think you have to-if you can do something about it, that you have to act on that, so that moms can grow up in a society that is hopeful for their children, you know, that their children are-can realize dreams. And to me the best type of society to do that is freedom. But it is very hard; it is difficult. And so you have to plant a seed, and you have to cultivate the seed, and eventually the crops will bloom. And we are beginning to see the crops beginning to bloom in parts of the Middle East. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, some people say that the war on terror is a war on [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Yet you went to the first mosque after 9/11, and you spoke there. How do you convince people in the Middle East that [PERSON] is not fighting a war against [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I know, and it troubles my soul, because I believe we are all God's children. And I hear people say, [PERSON] does not like [NORP], he wants to fight [NORP]. And first, I thank you for giving me the chance to, hopefully, set the record straight. But I am objecting to anybody who murders innocent people to achieve their objectives. I do not think people who murder in the name of religion are truly religious people. And secondly, I would hope that people would know that when we try to use some of our influence to help on education programs, for example, or we welcome students, [NORP] students, to [GPE] to study here, that it is a sign of respect and a sign of my desire to reach out to all people regardless of their religion. [INTERVIEWER1]. Absolutely. wanted also to ask you about, in [DATE], if you look back, would you do things differently? Would you have done things that you probably thought for a second-for the second time, I would have done them a different way? [INTERVIEWED]. I am sure there will be. I mean, there is been some disappointments. [INTERVIEWER1]. Like what? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, like, [FAC] was a terrible disappointment. And admittedly, I was not there on the site, but I was the Commander in Chief of a military where these disgraceful acts took place that sent the absolute wrong image about [GPE] and our military. You know, parts of [GPE], it is taken longer than I thought it would. On the other hand, I am pleased to see a multiethnic society begin to emerge. I talked to the leaders of [GPE] [DATE] and [DATE] and congratulated them on doing some hard work. And I love to hear their spirit in their voice. And so I am confident history will say, Oh, [PERSON] could have done it better here, or, [PERSON] could have done it better there. But I think from the strategic point of view, I am confident that the idea of moving liberty in the region, a [CARDINAL]-state solution to help the [NORP]-Palestinian issue, the liberation of [GPE], and the follow-up with the- to help the [NORP] realize their sovereignty-a strong push-back against Iran- I believe when people objectively analyze this administration, they will say, Well, I see now what he was trying to do. [INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, the [NORP] peace initiative, it was a framework. Do you think that President-elect [PERSON] should use it in terms of achieving peace in the Middle East? [INTERVIEWED]. I definitely think it was a major breakthrough for then Crown Prince, now His Majesty, King [PERSON], to take the initiative and lay out the conditions for peace. And it is, I think, a useful foundation to help solve a longstanding problem. I do believe there will be a [NORP] state. I feel comfortable in saying that the decision-my decision to promote a [NORP] state, being the first President to do so, was the right thing for peace- right thing for peace for the [NORP], right thing for peace for the [NORP]. And [PERSON] was very useful and very bold in laying out the [NORP] peace initiative. [INTERVIEWER1]. We are going to talk about all this in details so-- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, come on, I will show you [FAC]. [INTERVIEWER1]. --let us walk and talk as we go down to [FAC]. [INTERVIEWED]. You have seen [FAC] before. [INTERVIEWER1]. I have, many times. [INTERVIEWED]. Many times. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. It is beautiful. [INTERVIEWED]. It is [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. What are you going to miss most about this place? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, I will miss a lot. I am-I have got such respect for our military, and I admire people in our military so very much. I will miss being the Commander in Chief. But you know, [ORG] is full of incredibly gracious and kind people who work hard to make family life as normal as possible. And so I will miss a lot of the people we work with here. [INTERVIEWER1]. And what is your plans? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am going to move back to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER1]. And what are you going to do there? [INTERVIEWED]. And I am going to, you know, write a book, I think, about what it was like to be President and some of the hard decisions I had to make. I am going to start a institute that will promote freedom. And this will be an interesting place, particularly in regards to the Middle East, because this will be a place where there will be a forum for people with different issues to come and discuss. You know, I would love to have, you know, [NORP], such as the President or the Prime Minister, to come and describe to the [NORP] what it was like to be in that part of the world. Or you know, there is just a lot of really interesting opportunities for people to come and lecture and think and talk. [INTERVIEWER1]. And in your book, obviously, we are talking about foreign policy. Most of it happened in the Middle East-okay, we are off camera now. I hope the guy is okay. [INTERVIEWED]. A lot of-yes. He fell into [FAC]. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for this exclusive interview with us-- [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER1]. --and thank you very much for granting us, to [ORG], and to me, personally, on behalf of [NORP] media. I really do appreciate it; I am very grateful. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. I have enjoyed working with you. You have been a very fair journalist, and it is been a pleasure to have known you. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. You are the first [NORP] President to call for the establishment of a [NORP] state. You had hoped that you would have this state realized when you leave office. Do you think that you could have done more? Do you think that you have thrown all of the weight of the [GPE] behind this vision? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. We threw all the muscle and all the weight of [GPE] behind the vision. I am-you know, I wish there would have been a clearly defined state by the time I left office. However, I do take comfort in a couple of things. [CARDINAL], the attitude toward a [NORP] state has shifted. I think there is universal recognition in the region that in order for there to be peace, there must be [CARDINAL] states living side by side in peace. Secondly, I am pleased that Prime Minister [PERSON] and President [PERSON], after [GPE], have worked very hard to narrow the differences on a variety of issues. And they have; they have made substantial progress. Thirdly, I am pleased that there is the [NORP] peace plan, which is an essential part of creating the conditions for a [NORP] state to evolve. Fourthly, I am grateful that at the [GPE] conference all [NORP] nations were represented, which is an important signal, because I learned a lesson in studying previous efforts for peace that there must be regional buy-in. In other words, the nations in the region must stand with the [NORP], in particular, and say this is-we support you. And so-and fifthly, by the way, I am pleased with the progress being made to help the development of an infrastructure in [GPE]. Prime Minister [PERSON] has asked for help. A lot of nations are helping, including [GPE]; we are helping with security measures. Generals [PERSON] and [PERSON] have been very helpful. My friend Prime Minister [PERSON]-former Prime Minister [PERSON], who was here [TIME] for dinner-and I talked about the economics that are beginning to take place in the region. In other words, a state can be defined on paper, but it also has to be defined in a civil society and a strong economy. And it is beginning to happen. [INTERVIEWER1]. How do you see the [NORP] issue evolving in [DATE]? I mean, Prime Minister [PERSON] said, actually, there is no peace without [GPE], and I guess that means [ORG] as well. Do you share that vision? [INTERVIEWED]. I share the vision that the only way there is going to be peace is where those who assume that violence is necessary to achieve peace cannot be a part of the process. In other words, people have to renounce violence in order to have peace. It is contradictory to say, I am going to use violence to achieve my objectives, and oh, by the way, I am for peace. And so ultimately, [GPE] has got to be- look, [GPE] has to be a part of a [NORP] state, and the [NORP] state has to be contiguous territory; it cannot look like Swiss cheese. And it is got to be a state in which the sovereignty of the [NORP] people is-reigns supreme. [INTERVIEWER1]. So you are confident it is going to emerge? [INTERVIEWED]. I am. I really am. There will be fits and starts. I mean, if this were a straight line between vision and reality, it would have happened. But there is a lot of complicating factors. Obviously, the terrorists create complicating factors. Secondly, politics creates complicating factors, both within the [NORP], as well as the [NORP], as we have seen. But nevertheless, the foundation is there. People-if you give people a choice, ultimately give them a choice between [CARDINAL] states side by side in peace or this unresolved dispute, what would they choose? They would choose peace. And this will happen. [INTERVIEWER1]. What will [INTERVIEWED] pick up from where you left? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we have left it in good shape. We have left it with the vision intact. In other words, a lot of people now share the vision of [CARDINAL] states. As I say, there is been progress between the [NORP] Prime Minister and the [NORP] President toward what a state should look like. I think the [NORP] are getting-be more comfortable with the notion that a state will not create less security for them, but more security for them. And the [NORP] world, because of the [NORP] initiative as well as the [GPE] conference, are showing more and more willingness to be constructive partners in getting peace. [INTERVIEWER1]. The [GPE] and [GPE] have a close strategic relationship. You personally have a very good working relationship with King [PERSON]. Yet you do not see eye to eye on many issues. How did you resolve that? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we do. I think we got-I think we agree more than we disagree. First of all, I hold His Majesty in high respect. I appreciate, for example, the religious dialogue that he instigated, and I was honored to be invited to go to [GPE]. I thought that was a very smart way to help promote understanding, and understanding eventually leads to peace. He is a man who understands that terrorists can destroy his own society. And so I-I do not know if the world understands this or not, but [GPE] has been very firm in dealing with [ORG]. And remember, it was [ORG] that tried to blow up their oil infrastructure; they killed their citizens. And His Majesty knows full well that that kind of terrorism cannot coexist with a peaceful society. When I have my discussions with him, I find there is a lot more common ground than not. [INTERVIEWER1]. So there is no disagreement with the [NORP] issue with what-- [INTERVIEWED]. I think [PERSON]-look, the [NORP] peace initiative actually talks about, you know, [GPE] solving its problems with [GPE] and [GPE] and the [NORP], and there will be universal recognition when that happens. And so to me that is a very positive statement. And that the idea of a [NORP] state as part-as far as being part of the solution to the overall problem is something I believe he agrees with. I do not want to put words in his mouth, because he is my dear friend. [INTERVIEWER1]. In [DATE], there was an emergence of [GPE] as a regional player in many of the countries in the Middle East. Do you see that played on the-kind of at the expense of traditional allies of the [GPE], like [GPE] and [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it is going to be very important for the initiatives instigated by [GPE] to show results, for example, with [ORG]. Now, [ORG]-in my judgment, the violent wing of [ORG] damages the prospects for a [NORP] state. Or with [ORG]-I believe that [ORG] is a very destabilizing influence, particularly when they resort to violence. So what I would look for, and do look for, and would hope the next President would look for is, okay, are these initiatives bearing fruit? We, of course, appreciate, you know, our basing agreement with [GPE], and we thank them very much for that. And we would hope that they would follow through to deliver the results for peace, which is what we all want, I hope. [INTERVIEWER1]. We are going to move to [GPE]. Recently, the [GPE] and the [NORP] Government have signed the status of forces agreement. What do you think of it? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that the strategic framework agreement and the status of forces agreement is a sign that the [NORP] democracy is emerging and is healthy. There was a lot of debate on the [ORG] and [ORG], and there were people that were-you know, a lot of people were saying, well, this will be bad for [GPE], and others say this will be good for [GPE]. And after the debate was over, it was ratified by the people's assembly, and I think that is a healthy sign. I also think it is very good to have an agreement in place that recognizes the sovereignty of [GPE] and recognizes that [GPE] will be moving its forces out of cities and then eventually out of the country based upon success. [INTERVIEWER1]. In retrospect, would you think that this war could be averted? [INTERVIEWED]. We tried to avert it. I know people say, Oh, [PERSON] likes to use the military. That is the hardest thing for a President to do, is to put soldiers in harm's way, because I knew what would happen. And you know, that is of course manifested when I meet with mothers of fallen soldiers or wives or husbands. And it is incredibly sad, as I am sure you can imagine, very emotional, to hug and to cry with families. And I have met with a lot of families-a lot-so I knew the consequences. I really did. And I was hoping that through diplomatic pressure that we would be able to resolve this issue peacefully. And I remember-you cannot take this [GPE] out of the post-9/11 context. We'd been attacked, and here is a man who I have said repeatedly, you know, was not directly involved in 9/11, but had used weapons of mass destruction and had supported terror and had paid the families of suicide bombers and was a sworn enemy of [GPE] and had invaded [CARDINAL] countries and had ignored, you know, [CARDINAL] or however many resolutions in [ORG]. He was a threat. But I did go to [ORG], as you remember. Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences, is what [CARDINAL] said. And I firmly believe the choice was [PERSON] to make, and he made a fateful choice. Then the interesting point was, after he was removed, with a broad coalition of countries, what do we do? You know, do we pick a strong man and say, here is [GPE]'s guy and put him in there? Or do we work so that the [NORP] citizens would be able to pick their own form of government and their own people? And that is what we chose to do, and it is been really hard. [INTERVIEWER1]. Was it worth it? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. I believe a Middle East with [PERSON] in power [DATE] would be different, much different than the one [DATE]. I think you'd see a man with a lot of oil wealth willing to use terrorist connections to try to compete, for example, with [PERSON]. There could conceivably be a nuclear arms race taking place, while even though [PERSON] did not have nuclear weapons, it is certain, at least to the experts, that he still had the capacity to make nuclear weapons. And there would be nothing more destabilizing for the Middle East than to see [GPE] trying to develop a nuclear weapon and [GPE] trying to develop a nuclear weapon. So I think the Middle East is a much better place without [PERSON] in power, and the sacrifices by both the [NORP] people and the coalition forces to achieve where we are today.[INTERVIEWER1]. But some say, sir, that the removal of [PERSON] has bolstered [GPE] and make emergent as a regional superpower. [INTERVIEWED]. I disagree completely with that. I think the emergence of a democratic and stable [GPE] on [GPE]'s border is in the- will help more likely keep the peace vis-a-vis [GPE] in the Middle East. Secondly, what has changed with [GPE] is universal recognition about the dangers of [GPE] having a-the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. And therefore, [CARDINAL] of the objectives of my administration is to create an international coalition all saying the same thing, which is, you have defied the [ORG], therefore, you cannot be trusted to say that you are only enriching for civilian nuclear power; therefore, stop your process, verify they stopped their enrichment process; otherwise, there will continue to be international sanctions. [INTERVIEWER1]. The [NORP]-recently your administration has been involved diplomatically with the [NORP]. Do you think that actually you can bring them to the international fold by engaging them diplomatically? [INTERVIEWED]. We are trying to-we have offered them a way forward; it is verifiably suspend your enrichment. And we will be at the table with other nations. And so, well, we discussed [GPE] with [GPE] in a regional context. But we have said there is-if you want to have diplomatic relations and discussions with [GPE], verifiably suspend your enrichment program. Our objective is to stop their gain of knowledge that would enable them to build a nuclear weapon, because having a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing to the region. And so there is a way forward for them to have diplomacy. But it is their choice, and thus far, they have not chosen to do it. And I regret that our relations are with [GPE]-are this way, because I have great respect for the [NORP] people and the [NORP] history. And I know that they can have a better future with the rest of the world, if their leadership were to abandon its desire to learn how to build a nuclear weapon. [INTERVIEWER1]. I have a few questions about just [GPE] and [GPE], but my time is over. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for your-you are a beautiful interviewer. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. So can I go ahead? [INTERVIEWED]. Quickly. And then I really do have to go. [INTERVIEWER1]. Sure, absolutely. I wanted to talk about [GPE]. Basically, the [GPE] attacked [GPE]. But do you see-- [INTERVIEWED]. The [GPE] [INTERVIEWER1]. --attacked [GPE] recently. There was a target inside [GPE] that was attacked by-- [INTERVIEWED]. Allegedly, yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. Allegedly. But do you see this kind of tension will succeed soon, or do you see the [GPE] diplomatically engaged in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. First of all, we discussed no operations. Secondly, we have engaged [GPE] early in my administration with Secretary [PERSON] and others. And our message was, if you'd like to have better relations with us, stop housing [ORG], violent [ORG], stop destabilizing the democracy of [GPE], stop facilitating the flow of terrorists into [GPE], be a constructive neighbor to countries, and we can have better relations. And they have, thus far, chosen to do that. Again, there is a way forward. But my worry about just sitting down with people and hoping that they end up behaving differently is that oftentimes it reinforces behavior that is not in our interests. And so I believe in conditional diplomacy. Now, there is a lot of multilateral diplomacy going on out of this administration. But in this case, just like [GPE], we will have diplomatic relations if you choose, but there is got to be behavioral change in order to justify it. [INTERVIEWER1]. And can you stabilize [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I have been trying to-[CARDINAL] of the great successes has been to get [CARDINAL] [NORP] troops out of [GPE]. I think one of the real keys to peace in the Middle East is [GPE]. And [GPE] is a democracy. I have met their President recently here in [FAC], which- had a very a good discussion. I have been very impressed by Prime Minister [PERSON]'s courage and boldness. We want to help [GPE] have an armed forces that are effective, so that they can protect their people. And we have been working very hard for [DATE] to free [GPE] as much as possible from foreign interference, so that its democracy can grow and mature and be a stable contributor to the region. President's Legacy in the Middle East [INTERVIEWER1]. How would you like the people in the Middle East to remember you? [INTERVIEWED]. I would hope they would remember me as [PERSON], as a man who respects their religion, respects human rights and human dignity, and prays for peace. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnatasabriskisloveniaspoptv", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. First of all, I would like to thank you very much for this opportunity and for your time, [INTERVIEWED]. . Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWED]. You are welcome. [INTERVIEWED]. 's Visit to [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Your first [DATE] and what just might be your very last trip to Europe as [INTERVIEWED]. include both includes both times a stop in [GPE]. Excellent choice, I might add. [INTERVIEWED]. I do not blame you for saying it. First of all, my first trip was consequential because that is where I first met [PERSON]. This trip is consequential because, of course, we are going to have an [ORG]-U.S. summit. And my impressions of [GPE] I have told this to a lot of people is first of all, it is a beautiful country. [INTERVIEWER]. It is. [INTERVIEWED]. Probably somewhat undiscovered in [GPE], but my fellow citizens ought to go and explore [GPE] cause it is , I think, not only it is got I mean, you can ski, you can play golf. [INTERVIEWER]. It is a lot of opportunities for mountain biking. [INTERVIEWED]. You can fish, mountain biking. So it is beautiful. And plus, the people are incredibly friendly. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. You are coming for the [GPE] summit. [INTERVIEWED]. Right. [INTERVIEWER]. To no dramatic announcements expected. But it will be the last summit for you. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. What outcome would you like to see? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, look, the important thing about these summits is that it reaffirms our mutual values of human rights and human liberty, of our desire to work together on some key issues. And [GPE] and [GPE] has had its differences on certain issues, and but we have always had the same common values. And it is important for me to signal to the [NORP], as well as my fellow citizens, that this relationship is an important relationship. And I am confident the next [INTERVIEWED]. will see it as an important relationship as well. But we will discuss a lot of important issues there too. [INTERVIEWER]. You are also coming to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Marshall plan and Berlin Airlift, the historic role [GPE] had after World War II in supporting Europe. And you know, Europe has changed a lot recently: Western Balkans, [CARDINAL] new states; [GPE] high on a priority list for [GPE]'s Presidency. I would like to hear, what do you think are the most memorable events, Europe-wise, that your administration helped to achieve in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [CARDINAL], of course, is the expansion of [ORG]. And it is a I will never forget going to [GPE] right after nations some nations were admitted into [ORG] and talking about Article 5 an attack on one is an attack on all. And a lot of countries had come from a different style of government and a different type of security arrangements to one in which free nations were bound together. And so the expansion of [ORG] and the offering of sending a positive signal to [GPE] and [GPE] recently has been an incredibly positive accomplishment. I think working together in [GPE] is a is going to be an historic achievement; helping a young democracy recover from a society in which women, for example, were treated as unbelievably second-class citizens. I mean, it was just a barbaric regime. Hopefully, in terms of trade, that we will fight off protectionism and keep trade open. I know there is some trade disputes going on, but that should not prevent us from being active in terms of perpetuating free and fair trade. And so one of the things, of course, we will be discussing is the [GPE] round of the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER]. That is true. And it probably [GPE] might be also high on the agenda at the summit? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, [GPE] kind of the common threats will be on the agenda. For me as you know, I am a big believer in freedom. Interesting that Europe is now whole, free, and at peace, and there is a reason why. And we got to, in my judgment, extend that same concept to the Middle East, from which a lot of violence comes. And obviously, one of the problems that we face is preventing [GPE] from developing the know-how as to how to make a nuclear weapon. And so we will be discussing that kind of joint efforts, multilateral efforts. But you know, I also want to emphasize that but [GPE] and I personally feel very strongly about helping people realize the blessings of life by freeing them from HIV/AIDS or malaria or hunger. And I am very proud of our Nation's accomplishments in terms of those agenda items. And I am looking forward to working with our [NORP] colleagues to see if we cannot make it even more robust. Visa Waiver Program [INTERVIEWER]. Next question would be on visa waiver. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. It is an issue, I know. It is an issue in Europe. [INTERVIEWED]. It is an issue. It is an issue. [INTERVIEWER]. And you know that currently, [GPE] enforces [CARDINAL] different systems for travelers from [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. [NORP] countries. Plus, you just announced new, stricter rules for countries that are part of the Visa Waiver Program. I wanted to hear your opinion on that, and maybe your answer to those in Europe who say that [GPE] is not as welcoming a place that it used to be. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. No, look, I am concerned about that impression, because we are a welcoming place. We want our friends to come. We want investment to be open. You know, first of all, I can understand why many of our friends in Europe who are not treated like other nations within the [ORG] are treated on visas are concerned. They say: Wait [TIME]. We are very supportive of [GPE]. We like [GPE]. And yet we are treated differently when it comes to visas. And this is a hangover from the old visa system, which I have been assiduously working to change. And we are making good progress. As a matter of fact, there I think there is going to be quite a few nations that were will get visa waiver. As to whether or not we have made it harder for visa waiver countries to come to [GPE], actually not; we have made it easier. In other words, you file your paperwork online before you come to [GPE], which should actually facilitate travel, we hope. But look, I am concerned that people say, Well, [GPE] no longer wants us to come, when it is the exact opposite of my personal point of view and the view of my government. [INTERVIEWER]. Sure. And I have to ask you this: Public surveys taken globally indicate kind of [NORP], and [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Europe is no exception in that. Do you believe that the [NORP] brand needs a makeover? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I mean, we stand for liberty and human rights and freedom. Look, I have had to make some tough decisions that some people did not like. But the truth of the matter is, when you really look at like, for example, our relations in the Far East, we got great relations with [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] [GPE]. Or [GPE], for example we got new relations with [GPE] that no administration has ever pushed South America, and Central America. My attitude is this this is what I tell people: First of all, you cannot make decisions based upon opinion polls. Secondly, that a lot of people like [GPE]; they may not sometimes necessarily like the [INTERVIEWED]. , but they like [GPE]. They like what [GPE] stands for. Otherwise, why would so many people wanting to be come here, for example, which we welcome. And so I do not I hear just stuff like that, and I just I dismiss it as kind of like what happens when there is , kind of, gossip and rumors and because the truth of the matter is, [GPE], just like many nations in Europe, stands for what is right, which is decency and freedom of speech and freedom to worship. And I am very proud of my country, obviously. [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. And on [NORP] Presidency, actually on elections, international policies are the aspects where the [INTERVIEWED]'s work that where the Commander in Chief has an opportunity to change the history's course. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. And that is why people around the world follow the [NORP] elections very, very closely. It is been very interesting so far. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it has. [INTERVIEWER]. The [NORP] [NORP] candidates have not been very easy on you. [INTERVIEWED]. Of course not. They got me look, if you are that is what happens. I mean, they say, We want change. Of course and I tell people, every time I ran for politics I said, We want change, unless, of course, I was the incumbent, in which case I was not for change; I was for myself. But what you will see is a lot of rhetoric, and I understand that. It is and, you know, I am in an unusual position because for [DATE], I have been an active candidate myself, and now I am kind of getting to be a senior kind of senior status. And I will help my party, and of course, I am for [PERSON]. But there will be a lot of debate, and it will be interesting to watch these candidates. [INTERVIEWER]. Sure. So your message to the 44th [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] would be? [INTERVIEWED]. Stand on principle, stay strong, promote freedom, defend [GPE], and work with our friends and allies to achieve common objectives. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for this interview. I hope you will have a safe flight to Europe. And as you referred to [GPE] [DATE], on our Prime Minister's visit to [FAC], as an interesting slice of heaven, I hope you will have a heavenly stay. [INTERVIEWED]. I will bet I do. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much. Good to see you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnedtemkotheobserverromeitaly", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. You are giving a major speech in [GPE] in [TIME] on what you describe as a new era of transatlantic union. And obviously, the picture in Europe is much more encouraging, it would seem, than [DATE]. What is changed, in your view, and what needs to be fixed? [INTERVIEWED]. This is the what is changed is the we have gone beyond the [GPE] period for [CARDINAL] reasons. [CARDINAL] is that [GPE] is democracy is succeeding. People are beginning to see progress. And therefore, people that at least governments that felt like they did not want to participate in the liberation of [GPE] have now wanted to participate in the reconstruction of [GPE]. And their people are beginning to see some success. [PERSON] has moved things [GPE] and comports himself like a leader would, and he speaks hopefully about the future. Secondly, that there are a lot of issues that we are focused on that kind of send a signal that cooperation is necessary to change the conditions of the world for the better cooperation on AIDS, cooperation on malaria, cooperation on trade, hopefully, discussion about climate change, cooperation in [GPE]. In other words, the agenda is varied, and it is profound. And my speech basically says that by focusing on these issues and by working together in a unified way, we can be trans-formative, just like we were in the past. [GPE] used to be inward looking right after World War II necessarily so to rebuild. [GPE] helped. Now we can be outward looking as we help others. I also have a I am a believer that liberty is transformative the power of liberty is universal, that moral relativism must be rejected, and that we have got to have confidence in liberty to help others so that we are more secure ourselves. And that is what the speech is. It is a hopeful speech. [INTERVIEWER]. And one of the areas of Europe where liberty has been sort of partly transformative is clearly [NORP] [GPE]. And you have had very strong personal relationship with [PERSON]. First of all, is your assessment that [PERSON] is still basically in charge? And how important is your personal relationship? [INTERVIEWED]. Let me start with the second. My personal relationship is important because we had differences. And therefore, if you work hard to establish a relationship of trust, that you are then able to air out your differences in a way that is respectful of the other person, and at the same time, find common ground. [CARDINAL] area of common ground that has really not been given much attention is [GPE]. I agreed that the [NORP] should have they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power. [PERSON] obviously believes they should; witness the cooperation on [GPE]. We both agree, however, that they cannot be trusted with the knowledge that comes from enrichment. And therefore, [PERSON] suggested to the [NORP] that [GPE] provide the enriched uranium necessary to run their fuel plant. I agree. And as I said [DATE] in the press conference, that this really undermines the argument for the [NORP] because if, in fact, their only focus is on civilian nuclear power, they readily accept the plant, the fuel, and the offer of [GPE] to pick up the spent fuel. So there are areas where we cooperate, and there are areas where we have disagreements. And yet I believe the best foreign policy for the [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] is to be in a position to earn the trust of those where there is not a [PERCENT]percent agreement. And by the way, any [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] will find out there is never a [PERCENT]percent agreement, even with your closest friends. [INTERVIEWER]. I am sure that is right. [INTERVIEWED]. And so the first part of the question yes, look, I think it is I went to [GPE]. [PERSON] introduced me to [PERSON]. And he, in not only his body language, but in his words to me that [PERSON] is going to be in charge of foreign policy. And their relationship is being sorted out, and the world is fascinated to watch what is happening. I think it is I will take him for his word, and then we will watch and see what happens. Religious Freedom [INTERVIEWER]. How concerned are you about issues like human rights in [GPE]? And what degree of influence does any outside country even [GPE] or [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, I think it matters. I think it matters when people speak up, whether it be in [GPE] or [GPE] or anywhere else. In [GPE]'s case, there was early on in my Presidency, I remember talking to [PERSON] on behalf of [ORG], where there were concerns about the [ORG] being able to have a robust presence. [PERSON] is sensitive to religious issues. He is a religious guy himself. He has a beautiful little [NORP] church on his own property, which he proudly showed me and [PERSON] [CARDINAL] time. He made sure I met some of the [NORP] community when I was there in [GPE]. And so he is sensitive to religious liberty, more so than some other countries. Natural Resources/Multilateral Relations [INTERVIEWER]. And is Western leverage reduced by the fact that [GPE] has a good chunk of the world's natural energy resources? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it certainly changes the equation on a lot of foreign policy. It is interesting to watch [ORG] wrestle with energy independence. Early in my Presidency, nations were saying they were going to get rid of nuclear power. And I questioned them quietly, on an individual basis, about that decision, because if you get rid of [CARDINAL] source of power, you have to find another source of power, unless, of course, you do not care whether your economy grows. Most leaders end up caring whether their economy grows. So I predicted to some of these leaders that there would be an issue in terms of having a sole source supplier, particularly of natural gas from [GPE]. And now there is great consternation within the [ORG]. And my only point is, is that this energy issue complicates a lot of foreign policy issues, including that between the [ORG] and [GPE], as well as that between [GPE] and [GPE], or the world and [GPE]. And the question is, what do you do about it? Energy Policy [INTERVIEWER]. Well, that was going to be my next question. [INTERVIEWED]. What we need to do about it in [GPE] is to get this Democratically controlled [ORG] to allow us to explore for oil and gas. We did an energy study when I first became [INTERVIEWED] that predicted it would be an issue if we did not explore for oil and gas. And what people do not understand is hydrocarbons are necessary as we transition to a new era, based upon new technologies. But new technologies do not arrive [TIME]. I mean, they just do not suddenly appear. It takes time and money to develop these technologies. The world is in the process of doing that. [GPE] is spending a lot of money on research, both privately and publicly. [GPE] is as well. And yet we forgot the notion of transitioning. And so we do not explore in [ORG], we do not explore for oil shale, we do not explore off the coast of [GPE], and we should be. Oil Prices/Upcoming Middle East Oil Summit [INTERVIEWER]. In terms of the oil price, which is obsessing most of the world now, is there anything individual governments can do, in your view? [INTERVIEWED]. There is no magic wand. It took us a while to get to where we are; it is going to take us a while to get out of it. And the truth of the matter is that there is either got to be more supply or less demand. And demand does not decline overnight, although patterns and habits are beginning to change in [GPE]. You notice some of these car manufacturers are now announcing they are going to be manufacturing smaller automobiles. I think that people have got to recognize that, I mean, our policy in [GPE] has been robust on the development of new technologies and weak on finding enough hydrocarbons so that we can become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. [INTERVIEWER]. In terms of the short term, fixing the oil price [INTERVIEWED]. You mean the magic wand? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. No, there is not one. [INTERVIEWER]. And in terms of these conferences, I notice there is going to be a conference in [GPE], and your national security staff [INTERVIEWED]. That would be [PERSON], the spokesman. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, indeed not unreasonably said that you would want to know what such a conference [INTERVIEWED]. I was asked this at a press conference [TIME]. I said it is an interesting idea. Of course, I am going to go home and take a look at what it all means, and I will decide who is going to attend on our behalf. But if I might repeat, the solution to the price of hydrocarbons is either more hydrocarbons or less usage of hydrocarbons. During my trips to the Middle East I have got great relations with the leaders there, and I talked to King [PERSON] about increasing the supply of oil, on the theory that if you harm your consumers with high price, they will find other ways to power their economies as quickly as possible. And secondly, he should not want to see kind of a worldwide contraction as a result of consumers spending money on energy that ends up overseas, as opposed to spending money on opportunities in their respective economies. So I think people, if they take a sober look at the world's supply, there is just not a lot relative to demand. [CARDINAL] of the things that could help is that if some countries, big consumers of hydrocarbons stop subsidizing their populations so that there is a response to price on the demand side. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE] has been very much on the agenda again, [DATE] [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it is. It should be. [INTERVIEWER]. and should be. [PERSON] has all but said no to the latest incentive package. If that stands, what is the next step in your view? [INTERVIEWED]. More sanctions. The next step is for the [NORP] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] to understand diplomacy only works if there are consequences. And sometimes the world tends to focus on the process as opposed to the results. And I have tried during my Presidency to say, we need to focus on the results. And for diplomacy to be consequential, there has to be a statement that says to the [NORP]: Here is your way forward; if you choose not to, there will be a consequence. And the consequence in this case, in the diplomatic channel, is sanctions that are effective. So we will work with our partners on implementation of the sanctions thus far in place through the [ORG], and work with them on additional sanctions, including through the [ORG] process, as well as through the financial process. [INTERVIEWER]. What is at stake here? Sorry, go on. [INTERVIEWED]. On the theory that there are people inside [GPE] who, [CARDINAL], are suffering as a result of the decisions their Government made; but secondly, leaders inside of [GPE] who are sick and tired of the isolation brought about by this regime. In [DATE], the [NORP] had agreed to verifiably suspend; we had agreed to say, there is a way forward, working with our [NORP] partners. In other words, there was a looked like a successful way forward for both sides of this debate. Then [PERSON] gets elected, changes the tone and changes the policy. And so my only point there is that and this is the point I make to our partners is that the [NORP] had adopted a different attitude during my Presidency in other words, in the relatively near past and that is not to say they cannot do it again. And now is the time. And the consequences of [GPE] having a nuclear weapon are substantial. They are substantial in the Middle East. If the people in the Middle East do not think that [GPE] and Europe, for example, are going to work to provide security, they will find their own ways to secure themselves. And what the Middle East does not need is a nuclear arms race. It does not need the instability that comes from an innate fear that the West is not strong enough or willing enough to take on the problem. Situation in the Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. So there is a lot at stake here, in your view. [INTERVIEWED]. In my judgment, it is the international issue that faces all of us. And therefore, success in [GPE] is important; it has consequences for the [NORP] issue. It is important for us to have security agreements with our friends. We, [GPE], has security agreements with [GPE], for example. When you go to the Middle East and you sit in my seat and listen, yes, there is concern about the [NORP] state. But the dialogue has shifted dramatically from solve the [NORP] state and you have solved the problems in the Middle East, to now solve the [NORP] issue and you solve the problems in the Middle East. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Let us assume that [PERSON] does not respond to this latest package, that there are additional sanctions. You clearly feel very strongly about this issue. [INTERVIEWED]. That is why I put all options on the table. [INTERVIEWER]. And there are other options, obviously. What happens if at [DATE], you have tougher sanctions, but you still have no resolution? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not want to speculate on that. My hope is, is that let us get the tough sanctions in place. That is the task. [INTERVIEWER]. But there is always an alternative on the table; there has to be. [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, yes, absolutely. [INTERVIEWER]. And you [INTERVIEWED]. And alternatives not just for [GPE], alternatives for a lot of other countries, some of which the world needs to think about as we head into this arena. We do not want a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. That is an alternative. [GPE] Foreign Policy [INTERVIEWER]. But you would be willing to hand over a status quo which was slightly improved, i.e., tougher sanctions? [INTERVIEWED]. Actually, it is not status quo because there is a multilateral forum in place that will enable [INTERVIEWED]s to more likely deal with this issue. I have made it clear that it is difficult for [GPE] to achieve an issue in a one-on-one situation with people like [PERSON] or [PERSON]. I have changed the foreign policy of [GPE] to make it more multilateral because I understand that diplomacy without consequences is ineffective. And the only way to achieve consequences through diplomacy is for there to be a universal application, in this case, of sanctions. Unilateral sanctions do not work. You know, I tell my partners, we are asking you to sanction. I know you are sitting there saying to yourself, Well, it is easy for him to say because they have already sanctioned. And the question facing countries is, does money trump effective diplomacy for the sake of peace and security? Progress in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE], you mentioned. Postsurge, are things heading in the right direction, in your view? [INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. [INTERVIEWER]. And how is [INTERVIEWED]. Violence is down. And as a result of violence being down, the economy is growing and political reconciliation is taking place. And the lesson learned in this postconflict period in both [GPE] and [GPE] is, you got to have security. I gave a speech at [ORG] that said it is a different set of issues that we face now than we faced [DATE] in postconflict. First of all, the conflicts took longer to resolve in World War II, and yet the reconstruction was done in relative peace and security. Here it took little time to accomplish the initial military objective, and reconstruction had to be done in the face of a lot of violence. And in [DATE], it became apparent that our strategy of training and encouraging the [NORP] to take the lead was not working; sectarian violence was severe. As you know, I made the decision to send [CARDINAL] more in because we recognized that and had belief that security would yield this kind of evolution of democracy, and it is. The number of laws they passed, [ORG] have passed, have been I would say it certainly exceeded expectations. And they passed their budgets faster than we have passed our budgets. [NORP] and [GPE] Troop Levels in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. I am sure that is true. [ORG], [PERSON] had said [DATE], I think, that he will announce sometime in [DATE] future plans for [NORP] deployment in [GPE]. [NORP] officers have acknowledged that in the recent fighting in [GPE], the [NORP] military role was crucial to making sure that there was a response. Is there not a concern that, whatever the justifications for a [NORP] withdrawal, that a [NORP] pullout of troops could have an effect either on [NORP] deployment or on the situation as a whole? Or are you relaxed about it? [INTERVIEWED]. I am , first of all, appreciative of the fact that [PERSON] is constantly in dialogue with us about what he and his military are thinking. Secondly, we ourselves are bringing out troops based upon return on success. And thirdly, I am confident that he, like me, will listen to our commanders to make sure that the sacrifices that have gone forward will not be unraveled by drawdowns that may not be warranted at this point in time. I am looking forward to discussing with him. We have had some discussions. He was going to be at [CARDINAL], I think, if I am not mistaken; he is now at [CARDINAL]. National Security Adviser [PERSON]. I think he is at [CARDINAL]. [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL], I do not know, whatever, but it is [INTERVIEWER]. But it did roll back on an [INTERVIEWED]. It is greater than he thought, in other words [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, that is right. [INTERVIEWED]. In other words, the Government took a look and said, Well, maybe we ought to leave more troops in. My only point is, is that timetables you say, timetable for withdrawal, and our answer is, there should be no definitive timetable; there ought to be obviously a desire to reduce our presence, but it is got to be based upon success. All I can tell you is, from my perspective, the [NORP] response has been that way. They have said, we are going to have we think we will be at [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL], but then adjusted their plans based upon the conditions. Iraq/[INTERVIEWED]'s Decisionmaking [INTERVIEWER]. Weapons of mass destruction in [GPE] obviously is [INTERVIEWED]. Still looking for them. [INTERVIEWER]. Still looking for them, exactly. [INTERVIEWED]. That was a huge disappointment. [INTERVIEWER]. And the obvious question your critics ask, particularly in [GPE], is if we'd known at the time there were not any WMD, would there have been this war? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, that is one of those great hypotheticals that we did not know. Now having said that, I still strongly defend the decision. The world is better off without [PERSON] in power. But [INTERVIEWED]s do not get to do redos; they do not get to do look-backs, ifs. All I can tell you is, is that we thought for certain there was weapons of mass destruction, as did the nations that voted for [DATE]. See, the interesting thing about history is that short-term, kind of momentary history, is that people forget what life was like at the moment that this decision was made. One, people forget that we tried to solve this problem diplomatically. You might remember, there was a great debate: Will [PERSON] go to [ORG], or will they move without trying to solve this problem diplomatically? Well, we did go to [ORG]; I insisted we go to [ORG]. And we worked diligently from [DATE] until [DATE] to see if we could not have solved this. We went back to [ORG] for a resolution. [INTERVIEWER]. For a second resolution, yes. [INTERVIEWED]. And in the meantime, we are working with our allies and friends. We did not realize, nor did anybody else, that [PERSON] felt like he needed to play like he had weapons of mass destruction. It may have been, however, that in his mind all this was just a bluff. After all, there had been [CARDINAL] [ORG] resolutions, the world was not serious, which leads me back to the point that when the world says something, it better have it better mean what it says, otherwise people who are destabilizing just do not take it seriously. Who cares? they say. And so I was asked in [GPE] one of the guys said, You making any mistakes? Of course, I said. [CARDINAL] of the mistakes was my language made it look like that I was anxious for war; that because of my language, I did not understand the consequences. Well, of course I understand the consequences. And I understand better than anybody that the Commander in Chief has got an obligation to comfort those who have lost a loved one because of his decision. And then the man went on and said, Well, was it a mistake to get rid of [PERSON]? The answer is absolutely not. [INTERVIEWED]'s Decisionmaking [INTERVIEWER]. You very movingly described in [CARDINAL] interview [DATE] that how difficult it is to put young [NORP] men and women in harm's way and how much time and energy you have tried to devote to doing what you can, obviously, to comfort the families of someone who has been killed [INTERVIEWED]. And making sure they understand that the sacrifice will not go in vain. Nothing worse than a politician making decisions based upon the last [ORG] poll when people's lives are at stake, or where they have made a sacrifice. And I tell these folks and they want to know look, there is a lot of them, and I have not visited with all the families. But I will tell you this: Many, many families look at me trying to determine whether or not, [CARDINAL], I believed that it was necessary; and [CARDINAL], whether or not I am going to let their son or daughter kind of lie in an empty grave when it comes to the sacrifice they made. They want to know whether or not the [INTERVIEWED] if he believes it was necessary, whether or not he is going to see this thing through, regardless of what they are screaming on the TV sets. [INTERVIEWED]'s Image Abroad [INTERVIEWER]. You are flying into [GPE] where your public awaits you, and you know there is a tough public there sometimes. [CARDINAL] of the questions [INTERVIEWED]. Do I care? Only to the extent that it affects people's view of my the citizens I represent. Do I care about my personal standing? Not really. [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] of the questions, of course, they ask, is, do you feel a sense of personal pain [INTERVIEWED]. Course I do. [INTERVIEWER]. over the [NORP] civilians who have [INTERVIEWED]. I feel a sense of pain for those who were tortured by [PERSON], by the parents who watched their daughters raped by [PERSON], by those innocent civilians who have been killed by inadvertent allied action, by those who have been bombed by suicide bombers. I feel a sense of pain for death. I feel a sense of pain for the families of our troops. I read about it [TIME], or I used to read about it [TIME]. The violence has changed. But I get a report [DATE] about whether or not the [GPE] has suffered casualties. And when I get those reports, I think about those mothers and fathers. And I meet with a lot of families a lot in order to be able to it is my duty to try to console and comfort. And many times, the comforter in chief ends up being comforted, by the way, by the families, the strength of the families. This is a volunteer army, and these kids are in this fight because they want to be in the fight. And they believe in it. And yet these poor parents are looking at oftentimes looking at negativity, just people quick to report the ugly and the negative. But it is hard to report on the schools that are opening or the clinics that are opening or the playgrounds that are filling up. The society is coming back. I have great faith in the power of liberty. First of all, I was not surprised when people went to vote in defiance of the killers. I was pleased, but not surprised, because I believe in the universality of freedom. I do not believe it is a Western value. And I say to people, I am concerned about the comfortable isolating themselves and saying, who cares whether somebody over there lives in a free society? And I will say in my speech, moral relativism must be challenged, this notion that it does not matter what forms of government are I think it does matter. I think it also matters, along these lines, that when I talk about freedom, it is just not freedom from tyranny, it is freedom from HIV/AIDS; it is freedom from malaria; it is freedom from hunger for [CARDINAL] reasons. [CARDINAL], it is in our national interests that we defeat hopelessness. The only way a suicide bomber can recruit is when he finds somebody hopeless. And secondly, it is in our moral interests. A nation is a better nation when it feeds the hungry and takes care of the diseased. And therefore, when I go to [ORG], my message to [ORG] is, yes, we will talk about the environment, and that is important. But [PERSON] is going to be talking about those people who are needlessly dying because of mosquito bites. And I expect them to honor their obligations. We came to [ORG] [DATE], and I said: Why do not you match what [GPE] does? We are putting up [MONEY] for HIV/AIDS, [MONEY] for malaria. And why do not you match us? And they said, Okay. And so we are going to go to [ORG] and we are going to sit down and say, Have we matched? Because there are people needlessly dying [DATE]. And we will come up with a good solution for greenhouse gases by getting [GPE] and [GPE] at the table. And it is going to take time to evolve, but I am going to remind people we can act [DATE] to save lives for the good of the world. [INTERVIEWED]. That means shorten my answers. Former Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. No, no, I will shorten my questions. [CARDINAL] very brief questions. First of all, your relationship with [PERSON] I am struck, in your last question, that you seem to share with him a genuine passion for ideas and that politics matter. How would you describe your relationship with [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. I would say, first of all, it is a relationship forged by fire. We share as you can tell, I have this idealistic streak, and so does [PERSON]. But we also understand that this idealism is a practical response to the world. See, this is an he understands, like I understand, this is an ideological struggle. These acts are not isolated acts of lawlessness. We are in a war. A lot of people hope this was not the war you know, just kind of dismiss it as, oh, there is some irritated guys, you know, just kind of making some moves. We viewed it as an ideological struggle that requires response through good intelligence, sometimes military, obviously, sometimes law enforcement, all aiming to dismantle and protect our people dismantle the cells and protect our people, but that ultimately, freedom has to defeat the ideology of hate. [INTERVIEWER]. Was [PERSON] your poodle, to use the [INTERVIEWED]. You know, look, this is the convenient one of the great things about Western press is that they oftentimes retreat to the convenient rather than trying to, you know, probe the depths of a relationship or the depths of somebody's feelings or the basis of philosophy. And so it is convenient. It is convenient to say, you know, warmonger, religious zealot, poodle. I mean, these are just words that people love to toss around foolishly. [INTERVIEWED]'s Legacy [INTERVIEWER]. How do you think and how do you hope that you and [PERSON] but particularly yourself how would you hope that the achievement what is your greatest achievement or your greatest pride as [INTERVIEWED]? And what is your greatest regret? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, just so you know, I am not going to be around to see it. There is no such thing as objective short-term history. It takes a while for history to have its you know, to be able to have enough time to look back to see why decisions were made and what their consequences were. So you know, I'd hope it'd be somebody who would use the influence of [GPE] to help transform societies by working on disease and hunger and freedom. And the liberation of [CARDINAL] people from the clutches of barbaric regimes is noteworthy, at the minimum. [INTERVIEWED]'s Beliefs [INTERVIEWER]. Does this job take its toll on you? I mean, can you [INTERVIEWED]. My spirits are pretty high. I mean, I am you got to believe, you know? You got to have a set of beliefs that are the foundation for your very being. Otherwise these currents and tides and [TIME] news and politics will kind of leave you adrift. And I tell people that when I get home, I am going to look in that mirror and say, I did not sacrifice my core beliefs to satisfy critics or satisfy pundits or, you know [INTERVIEWED]'s Future [INTERVIEWER]. And what next a foundation, a book? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am going to think about that, yes writing a book. I am going to build a [INTERVIEWED]ial library with a freedom institute at [ORG] all aimed at promoting the universal values that need to be defended. I am very worried about isolationism and protectionism. The world has gone through these isms before. And you watch and see, the protectionist debate is mounting in [GPE]; it is mounting in Europe, certainly. It was much easier to kind of blame the economic woes on external forces, and therefore, the response would be, okay, let us quit trade, let us make sure our jobs are not going elsewhere, and that is some of those concerns are legitimate. On the other hand, it is a forerunner of isolationism, and you know, I remind people that we have been through a period of isolationism and protectionism right before World War II. And, by the way, curiously enough, at that period of time, there was nativism as well. And I find it interesting that the immigration debate is now pretty pronounced around. And so I am going to set up a this is not , like, you know, a headquarters for [ORG]. And by the way, just so you know, the foreign policy I have just outlined for you is you know, it is not [PERCENT] received amongst conservative thinkers in [GPE] either. [ORG]'s [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, I know, yes. Do we have [TIME]? Ms. [PERSON]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Okay, so Ms. [PERSON]. I would say [TIME]. [INTERVIEWER]. [TIME], okay. [TIME] very quick this is going to seem slightly flippant, but you are going to the greatest fan club of [ORG] television show in the world on [DATE]. Since you are the only person who can review that program from experience [INTERVIEWED]. I have never watched it. [INTERVIEWER]. You are kidding. Why not? [INTERVIEWED]. Because I do not watch network TV. I read. [INTERVIEWER]. You read. Okay. And then the [INTERVIEWED]. I seriously do not watch TV. You know, I watch sports, but I'd much rather read books. And I do, I read a lot. I may even read yours. Progress in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. And then the last question [INTERVIEWED]. But I will not be able to find it because it is written by so-called written by the other guy. Q. Certainly true. Last question, which comes back to [GPE] again. [PERSON] and I thought your question on the pain you feel personally was quite clear and absolutely strong. [PERSON] [DATE] phoned a voter who was upset about [GPE], and apologized on behalf of the Government, not for the war, which he still thinks was the right thing, but for the kind of suffering of the [NORP] people. Do you think that is a wise thing to do? [INTERVIEWED]. I think the [NORP] people yes, some have suffered, no question. But they are living in a free society. Everybody is going to have to handle their own internal business the way they want to. I am not going to second-guess [CARDINAL] way or the other. But my view is, is that when you talk to [NORP], they are thrilled with the idea of living in a free society. Do they like the fact that violence is still there? No. But every society reaches a level of violence that is tolerable. And has that reached [GPE]? I do not know yet. But I do know life is improving. I do know they live under a Government that they helped elect, or they elected. And there is still a lot of work to be done, do not get me wrong, but and you know, the thing that people ought to focus on is the courage of the [NORP]. They put up with a lot of violence, [NORP] killing [NORP]. But first of all, there have been some accidents, but nobody can claim that [GPE] or [GPE] are intentionally killing innocent people. We are not. As a matter of fact, warfare has changed a lot. [INTERVIEWER]. But the existence of the war has led to the deaths of innocent people, and the fact is [INTERVIEWED]. It has, but before the war, [CARDINAL] were discovered in mass graves. Freedom Agenda [INTERVIEWER]. So on balance, you have [INTERVIEWED]. Freedom trumps tyranny every time. And it is hard for people to see that. It is hard for people sitting afar to say, Is not that beautiful, somebody lives in a free society? And my point is, is that I think it is important for those of us who do live in free societies to understand that others want to live in free societies. And it takes time and sacrifice and effort to get that done. But one of the lessons of history is, is free societies yield of peace. I remind people, [DATE] is not all that long. And to say that Europe would be whole, free, and at peace prior to the end of World War II would have been, you know, you would have been viewed as a hopeless idealist. Well, I am making the point that I when I gave my speech at the [ORG], if you read what I said, here is what [DATE] the world can look like, and I believe will look like, unless we all retreat. It is not worth it, you know. And my point is, it is working. [INTERVIEWER]. Good. Thank you very much. And thank you for taking so much time.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWED]. Hello? [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I want to give you the first question and to point out that the attention you have given our Senator [PERSON] in [DATE] has raised his level of notoriety to a point that he has not known since he was elected. Now, I know you would not trade a vote, but is there anything that you and Senator [PERSON] mutually want in terms of legislation or other benefits for [GPE] that you have an interest in? [INTERVIEWED]. The main thing that Senator [PERSON] was concerned about-he was interested in [CARDINAL] things, to be fair, and there was-in the national interest. [CARDINAL] was to minimize the burden on middle class taxpayers. And when he looked at the whole package and saw that working families with incomes under $30, 000 were held harmless and that working families with incomes of $[MONEY], 000 and $[MONEY], 000 were looking at a $[MONEY]-a-year burden with the spending cuts, I think that really made a big difference to him. The other thing that he was interested in that I think is certainly as significant over the long run is he wanted a program that had some real economic growth incentives, that had some business help in it. And this program does a lot for small businesses. [PERCENT] of the small businesses in the country are eligible for a tax reduction if they reinvest more money in their businesses. It does more for research and development. It does more for revitalizing homebuilding and real estate. It does more across a whole range of issues. For the heavy industry in [GPE], under this plan, there will be more incentives to invest in new plant and equipment in [GPE] to be competitive there as opposed to going overseas. So all those things were important. And then the third issue that he raised, which I certainly agree with him on, is that we need to bring this deficit down to [CARDINAL]. And in order to do that, we are going to have to cut more. But to do that, we have to reform the health care system. So the next issue is how to bring down health care costs so we can get this budget deficit down to [CARDINAL] and not just take [MONEY] off of it. [INTERVIEWER]. Have you convinced him, [INTERVIEWED], that these changes are enough to get his vote on this issue? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I hope so. I have worked hard on that. That is going to be up to him, not me, and I do not think I should speak for him. But let me say this: I think he has really done a good job here, and he has been very important in bringing a business, pro-jobs perspective to the whole debate. So we will just see. But we have got a $[MONEY], $[MONEY], $[MONEY]-something in that range-[MONEY] deficit reduction package. We are now going to have more cuts than tax increases in the package. [PERCENT] of the [NORP] people, of people with incomes over $[MONEY], 000 will pay [PERCENT] 75 percent of the burden now. And there are quantifiable spending cuts now in excess of [MONEY] across the whole range of [ORG] programs. So it is a very important first step here. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you have not had quite as good a success with our Senator [PERSON], who, I think, like many people in [GPE] are concerned that the spending cuts to come later- when we went through that in [DATE], and they never came. Why should things be different this time? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, for [CARDINAL] thing I am going to have a trust fund and all the money will have to be put into the deficit reduction package, both the spending cuts and the tax increases. What actually happened in [DATE], [PERSON], to be completely accurate about it, is that the [ORG] adopted a plan based on the previous administration's rosy revenue estimates. And no one really thought the revenues would grow that much; so they did not . And then spending increased because the recession went on and more people were entitled to [ORG] and [ORG]. And between those [CARDINAL] things, they were in deep trouble. Now, let me just address the major objections Senator [PERSON] has, because I think what he says is right, but it is not a good reason to vote against this program. What he says is that in order to take the deficit from where we are taking it down to [CARDINAL], you have to do something about the entitlement programs, especially about [ORG] and [ORG]. Now, that is true. But the problem is if you do not reform the health care system, that is, if you do not fundamentally restructure the system of the way health care is insured against and the way the-cutting out a lot of the paperwork and a lot of the things that are more expensive in [GPE] than anywhere else that have nothing to do with health care, and you cut the medical expenses of [ORG], all in the world you are going to do is have a hidden tax on the private sector because the providers will do what they always do. They will pass their costs on to people that have insurance. So that, for example, [ORG] would have its medical premiums go up more than otherwise would be the case because the Government's not paying the full cost of its health care. So I do not disagree that we have to do something about health care costs and entitlements. But the time to do that is in the context of a health care reform debate, which we are going to start as soon as we can get this budget out of the way. If we do not adopt the budget, we will never get there. Everybody who looks at it can see that this budget's a lot better deal than the one in [DATE]. The numbers are more realistic. The growth package is realistic. We have got new business capital gains tax in there and all kinds of other incentives for small businesses to grow. [PERCENT] of the small businesses can get a tax reduction under this plan because of it. This is going to create some jobs, too. So it is a better package. But you cannot solve all the problems of the world in this bill. That is my quarrel and dispute with Senator [PERSON]. He is right, you have got to get the entitlements if you want to go to [CARDINAL], but we are going to have to do it in [CARDINAL] steps, not [CARDINAL]. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a lot of people are concerned with, out here, the fact that the spending reductions, the major ones, seem to come so late in the plan, and the tax increases come so early. Would not it be better to go back in and make another slash, even if this means delaying the budget a little bit? [INTERVIEWED]. Here is the problem with it: First of all, there are going to be more spending reductions all the way along. [ORG] has already approved [MONEY] in spending reductions over and above what is in this budget, but working with me. I have encouraged them. The Vice President is going to have a reinventing [ORG] report out sometime [DATE], which will provide a lot more savings. So we are just getting started on the spending reductions. And then as I said, we will be able to project [DATE] of spending controls in the health care area if we do health care reform. The problem is that no matter what you do with that, the budget we have now and the budget we are going to have [DATE]-we are already preparing to cut more off [DATE] right now. But that is not an excuse not to act now. Still the big reductions in spending are those that aggregate up over time. That is, if I cut [MONEY] [DATE] and [MONEY] [DATE], then that is [MONEY] over this [DATE]'s figure and then [MONEY] and [MONEY]. You see what I mean? So the spending cuts are always going to look bigger in [DATE] because they compound one another. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], we are relaying some of our readers' questions. [CARDINAL] of them was, how can the job market grow when small businesses are afraid new taxes and the health plan will put them out of business? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, new taxes and the health plan will not put them out of business. We have tried to send a clear signal to the small business community that there will not be a tax problem here. But if they have to have a premium to cover their own employees, we will limit how much of their payroll it can be, and it will be phased in over a period of years. But let me flip it over to you on the other side. [PERCENT] of the small businesses in [GPE] provide some health care coverage for their employees, and almost all of them pay much more than they should because we are the only country in the world that forces employers who cover their employees to subsidize employers who do not , and that is what happens. Everybody in this country gets health care, but if you do not have health insurance and you cannot pay for it, you get it too late when it is too expensive. You show up at the hospital; you get cared for, and then the providers, the doctors and the hospitals, in effect, raise their costs to everybody else. So you could argue that the small business community as a whole in this country is more hurt by the system we have than by the one we are moving to. Also, let me make [CARDINAL] other point. We spend [MONEY] on the dollar more than any other country in the administrative costs of our health care system because we have [CARDINAL] separate health insurance companies writing [CARDINAL] of different policies, all with different rules and regulations, so that the cost of compliance is staggering, and then the Government aggravates it. So I think the small business community will wind up ahead on this. But we have tried to send some clear signals that we are not going to pop them with a big payroll tax, and I do think employers who do not provide anything for their employees should bear some responsibility through the private insurance system. But it ought to be limited and phased in so that nobody goes broke doing it. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], on [DATE], [DATE] we had a conversation with [PERSON] about your budget plan, and one of the questions we asked him was what the administration would have done differently to sell this plan. And he was very frank about it. He said, We would have started a lot earlier. And I am curious in terms of your strategy why you did not really start giving everybody the hard sell a lot earlier. [INTERVIEWED]. You mean not in the [ORG] but in the country? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, talking to the people. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, actually we did a lot of that, but we did not have our war room set up, and we were, frankly, just overwhelmed by the day-to-[DATE] news coverage of [NORP] carping about taxes and unable to kind of break through about what the facts of the program were. I worked hard-for [DATE] after I made my State of the Union Address I went out into the country once a week. I did my best to talk about the program. But we did not have the kind of organized disciplined effort we have had for [DATE] in reaching out to local newspapers and television and radio stations and bringing in opinion leaders and doing all these things we are doing now. And I think we did lose control of the debate. Also, to be fair to them, to [PERSON] and the others, an issue like this tends to go through cycles. I told the people about it on [DATE], and they liked it. Then the sort of negative rhetoric took over. Now we are kind of coming back to reality, and all the surveys show we are bringing it back our way now. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON] has been giving some subliminal signals about raising interest rates. Would not that sort of derail your plan for reducing the deficit if the interest rates went up? And are you worried about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am. I do not think you should raise interest rates until there is real economic growth that brings on real inflation. I mean, there is no real inflation in this economy, and we can have growth without inflation. And I think we may be reading too much into his remarks. [INTERVIEWER]. Have you talked to him directly about what he did mean since he made those remarks? [INTERVIEWED]. No, but I talk to him fairly often, and I am scheduled to have another session with him pretty soon. I know him pretty well, and my read on what he said was if inflation warranted it, he might raise interest rates. But if you think about it, what we are trying to do in bringing the deficit down is to justify keeping the interest rates down even when there is economic growth because [ORG] will be taking less capital away from the markets, and therefore, there will not be as much competition for it, and we ought to be able to keep lower interest rates. That is our theory. He has constantly and consistently supported the deficit reduction efforts of this administration in very explicit terms. So I would be surprised to see him raise interest rates when we are doing something to support the reverse. If we were having [PERCENT] [PERCENT] growth and inflation was getting out of hand, I could understand it. But there is no grounds for it now. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], obviously, in this part of the country it would have been more popular to cut spending first, raise revenue later. You used the [DATE] forecast of the deficit to go back on your pledge for a middle class tax cut. Since, there have been other estimates, why have not you gone back to a cut spending first program? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, we are cutting spending. We are cutting spending. This idea that we are raising taxes-taxes come in constant amounts, whether it is a fuel tax or an income tax. This is a dodge. [PERSON], who pioneered [PERSON]'s program in [DATE], has now admitted in repeated interviews that they cut taxes twice as much as they meant to because they got into a bidding war with [ORG], that there is no way to restore any kind of fairness to the Tax Code or reduce the deficit to [CARDINAL] unless there is a revenue component. So if I were to say, Okay, we will put these spending cuts in for [DATE], and then we will raise taxes, all we would do by doing that is basically have a bigger deficit in [DATE] because we'd have the spending cuts but not the taxes, and we would have higher interest rates, and we'd have slower economic recovery. Let me just say, in [DATE] that I am in now- which I am not even responsible for this budget until [DATE]-our deficit is going to be [MONEY] less than it was predicted to be when I became [INTERVIEWED]. But to go back to the middle class tax argument, after the election but before I took office, the previous administration said, Oh, by the way, the deficit's going to be [MONEY] bigger over [DATE]. So I always in that campaign said I am not going to say read my lips because I have run a government long enough at the [ORG] level to know that sometimes circumstances can change on you. I have been very candid with the [NORP] people about that. I think most people with incomes of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year do not think $[MONEY] a year is too much to pay. I think what most people have believed is, they have been told that they are going to be paying a fortune. And [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] [INTERVIEWED]. Now, wait [TIME]. Let me just finish this. I want to make this point. I am going to be [INTERVIEWED] [DATE]. We have got opportunities to have even more fairness in the Tax Code if we are bringing down the deficit and we are opening up economic growth. There are all kind of options to do things over [DATE]. But the most important thing now is to do something about the deficit. The truth is that all these people who say they want to cut spending now, what they really want is an accounting practice which still would have all the spending cuts come in [DATE] and 5th year of this budget cycle. What they are really saying is let us pass a bill that says it is going to cut spending later now before we raise taxes. They do not propose more spending cuts in [DATE] than I do, none of them do. And to go back to Senator [PERSON]'s bill, particularly the one he offered in the [ORG] did not have nearly as much support as the one I offered, because it did not have the kind of deficit reduction unless you did what he proposed to do, which was to take more out of [ORG] for middle class people. And even then it was not going to happen for [DATE] or 5th year, most of it. So the people that say cut spending now are saying, We do not want to cut any more spending than [PERSON] does right now, but we want to pass a bill that cuts spending in [DATE] and 5th year in health care without health care reform and then talk about whether we should tax the wealthiest [NORP] later. That is what they are really saying. [INTERVIEWER]. Is there any chance, do you think, that this bill will go down? Is there any chance that it will not pass in the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, sure there is. But I think it will pass. And the reason I think it will pass is this: I think most of those people are going to say, is this a better bill than we have ever had before and better than we had in [DATE]? And the answer to that will be, yes. Is this fairer to average [NORP] than the ones we have been considering? The answer to that will be, yes. Does this restore some economic growth incentives for small business, for new high-tech businesses, for housing, for real estate that we have not had in the Tax Code for [DATE]? And the answer to that will be, yes. Does this bill lift the working poor out of poverty and encourage people to get off welfare, not with a Government program but by using the tax system to reward people who work, even at very low wages? The answer to that will be, yes. And then the last question is, do we want to hang around here in [GPE] for [DATE] and debate this, and either come back here and pass something very like it or something that is so much weaker that we will have higher interest rates, more uncertainty, and we will waste [DATE] when we could be dealing with health care, with welfare reform, with a crime bill, with things that will grow this economy with a new world trade agreement, all these things we need to get on about the business of doing. We are literally paralyzed here. We cannot get anything else done. The only other major initiative that is going to come out of this is the national service bill that I have been working on for a long time. Other things cannot even be dealt with. And again I want to say to those of you interested in the cut issue, keep in mind the Vice President is going to issue our reinventing [ORG] report within [DATE]. The [ORG] is still cutting some other spending with my strong support. We are going to have more cuts even than we have now. But to delay this program is a great mistake. All it will do is paralyze the Government, paralyze the financial markets, and leave us with uncertainty. We have been talking about this since [DATE]. It is time to move.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0", "text": "About [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER1]. As you are well aware, [GPE]'s Senator, [PERSON], is or was at last report among the small, key group of [NORP] Senators who've indicated reluctance to vote for your deficit reduction package. What are you doing or what can you do to get Senator [PERSON]'s vote? And do you think you will ultimately get it? [INTERVIEWED] . I do not know the answer to the last question, but what I have done is to try to take the strengths of both [ORG] and [ORG] versions of the bill and try to put them together. The strength of the [ORG] version was it had fewer overall taxes and was even more progressive. The strength of the [ORG] version was it had much more economic incentives, more economic growth incentives, for research and development, for investment in new firms, for small business, the things of that kind. So the argument that I am going to be making to all these Senators is that this plan now clearly has [MONEY] in deficit reduction; it will now have more spending cuts than tax increases in it; it will have [PERCENT] of the new tax burden now borne by people with incomes above $[MONEY], 000; that the middle class tax burden is now down to $[MONEY] a year; and that the economic growth incentives qualifying, for example, [PERCENT] plus of the small businesses in the country for a reduction in taxes if they invest more in their companies; and enabling the working poor through the earned-income tax credit to lift themselves above poverty by working full time, these are very, very important things. And the time has come to act. Now, let me say just as a generic thing, since this may help to shape some of the other questions: The people who are leaning against this program or have announced against it-not the [NORP], that is almost entirely a political deal; the [NORP] have even opposed the conservative amendments to our budget to control entitlements and impose discipline. But the [NORP] basically fall into [CARDINAL] categories: There are those who think it is the right thing for the country, but they are afraid there is been so much misinformation out there about it that they will get beat if they vote for it. And then there are those who think that it is a good first step, but it does not go far enough. The only thing I would say to the latter group is that we do have to do something on entitlements, but we cannot get there until we do something to reform health care spending overall, and that this is a major step that will stabilize the financial markets, keep interest rates down, and enable us to move on to health care reform, to getting a world trade agreement, to welfare reform, to the crime bill, to all these things that are out there crying for attention that we cannot even address if we do not go ahead and get this budget out of the way. And also, there will be further budget cuts. The Vice President's report on reinventing Government is due [DATE]. It will have many more suggested budget cuts. And [ORG] has already cut [MONEY] off the budget that we cannot fully count yet because the [ORG] has not acted. But when they do, we will have even more cuts. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. [INTERVIEWED], good [TIME]. [INTERVIEWED] . [TIME]. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Let me pass on to you a question I am getting increasingly from Constitution readers. How can you assure that your tax increase package does not have the same result as Mr. [PERSON]'s [DATE] tax increase package, which is to say no result at all except higher taxes? [INTERVIEWED] . I can do that in [CARDINAL] ways. First of all, let us look at what happened in [DATE]. Why did the deficit reduction package in [DATE] not produce the deficit reduction it was intended to? There were basically [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] reasons. But [CARDINAL] big reason is that they overestimated how much the revenues would bring in; that is, they had some very, very liberal revenue estimates, and those revenues did not materialize. So that within [DATE] after the package passed, they revised downward the amount of deficit reduction by [MONEY]. Now, we have instead taken the most conservative revenue estimates we could get. The second thing is that I have pledged to the [ORG] that by Executive order, I will put all of this money, the spending cuts and the revenue increases, into a trust fund and that every year if we miss the deficit reduction target, I will come forward to the [ORG] and give them a plan to meet the target, that is, to have further cuts to meet the target, and ask them to vote on it. I might say that we had those requirements in the law, and through the parliamentary rules of the [ORG], the [NORP] took it out of the law. [PERCENT] of the [NORP] agree with that budgetary discipline, and they took it out because they thought it was good politics for them to take it out and weaken the bill further. So I am going to do it by Executive order. So it is different. Now, let me say, there was [CARDINAL] other thing different from [DATE]. Because this plan has been taken much more seriously by the financial markets, it has already had a big impact in bringing down long-term interest rates, and that has led [CARDINAL] of people to refinance their homes and their business loans. And I am convinced once we actually pass the plan, we will release a lot of investment into the economy. The other thing we do that was not done in [DATE] is have investment incentives: [PERCENT] in small business expensing-that will qualify [PERCENT] of the small businesses in the country for a tax cut if they invest more in their business; a new business capital gains tax which will really help in high technology areas; we have got incentives to reinvest in homebuilding and to reinvest in new plant and equipment through changes in the alternative minimum tax. So there are a lot of pro-growth incentives in this plan that were not there in [DATE], and those are the principal differences. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. [INTERVIEWED], good [TIME]. [PERSON] is saying that this proposal should be rejected so Members of [ORG] can go back home, visit with their constituents, get a better feel for the spending cuts that would be accepted, come back in [DATE] and cut some more. Why should that not be done? [INTERVIEWED] . Well, because we have already got more spending cuts than revenue increases, number [CARDINAL]; because we are going to keep cutting spending, as I have said. But no one who looks at this budget deficit believes it can seriously be brought under control unless there are some revenue increases. And you know, I think it is pretty funny-I mean, I have got a [MONEY] gas tax in my plan. [PERSON] proposed [MONEY] a year for [DATE] or a [MONEY] gas tax increase in his plan, something he was running from [DATE] on television. I have more verifiable spending cuts than he proposed in his plan. We have done what we need to do here to get a budget out. Here is the problem: Nothing precludes us from cutting more spending. We are going to cut more spending. But until we pass this budget, we are paralyzed from going on to the next big problem with the deficit, which is health care costs and entitlements there. And that is got to be dealt with in the context of health care reform. We cannot get to health care reform; we cannot consider the next big round of spending cuts through reinventing Government; we cannot do the crime bill, which is very, very important; we cannot do welfare reform; we cannot do anything until we pass a budget. And we have debated this from [DATE] to [DATE]. These Members have been going home [DATE]. There will be more spending cuts. There will be more spending cuts in [DATE] I am here. But the time has come to pass this budget and get on with it. The tax burden is fair. Spending cuts now will exceed the tax increases. And we are going to put it all against the deficit. And we have just got to do this so we can go on and do the rest of it. To keep wallowing around in it will not serve anybody very well. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. What do you do about Mr. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED] . Well, nothing. He does not have a vote in [ORG]. I think what was done [DATE] was wonderful. The press kept saying, Well, what would you do? Here is your plan; how can you criticize [INTERVIEWED] ? Yours was off by [MONEY]. You are going to raise the gas tax by [MONEY]. And so I do not have to do anything. I think, you know, it was nice to see him answer some questions for a change. There is nothing for me to do. I have got a plan, and it'll work, and I want to pass it. And it is good for the country. Let me just say this: We had [CARDINAL] business executives here from big and small companies [DATE], [CARDINAL] energy company executives-[CARDINAL] of them were [NORP], [CARDINAL] of them was President [PERSON]'s cochairman-supporting this plan. And every [CARDINAL] of them said we have got to do it because we have got to bring the deficit down, we have got to keep interest rates down, we have got to stabilize the economy, we need some incentives to grow-every one of them. I mean, there is very broad support for this program among people who really understand it. When I went to [GPE] to meet with the leaders of other industrial nations at the G-7 summit, for [DATE] the statement coming out of that meeting had criticized [GPE] for its budget deficit. For the first time in [DATE], they complimented [GPE]. And they agree with me that we ought to go and try to get the [CARDINAL] countries that are in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to lower tariffs on a whole range of issues, eliminate them on a lot of other products. And everybody concedes, who is studied this, that this could add [CARDINAL] of jobs to the [NORP] manufacturing sector [DATE]. Why? Because we are doing something about our deficit. We have got to move. We do not need to delay this [DATE] or [DATE] or [DATE]. That is what they did in [DATE], by the way. [CARDINAL] of your questions was what did not work in [DATE]. In [DATE] they said, well, we just cannot make up our mind, so we will delay. So instead of adopting it in [DATE], they adopted it at [DATE]. That is [DATE] almost from [DATE] to [DATE], [DATE] we could be dealing with health care; we could be passing the Vice President's recommendations on reinventing Government, which would be even more spending cuts; we could be passing a crime bill to help make our streets safer; that we could be dealing with welfare reform; all these things to strengthen the economy. None of this can be done unless we get this out of the way. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Sir, there is been a good bit of discussion about the timing of the spending cuts, particularly saying that they mostly come in [DATE]. Could you please comment on the timing of the spending cuts? [INTERVIEWED] . Well, they were not timed to do that. The fact is that we have more control- when I took over this budget-these budgets are done on a [DATE] cycle. If you are going to make deep cuts, it is easier to plan for them if you have a little time to plan for them. And also under the previous budget that we inherited, the budgets were already tighter in [DATE], and they were much looser, I thought, in [DATE]. But I assure you, we are not waiting for that. I have already given instructions to my [ORG] to prepare more budget cuts for [DATE]. We have reduced the deficit in [DATE] since I have been in office, mostly because of lower interest rates, by [MONEY] over and above where it was projected to be. So there are budget cuts in [DATE], but it is like planning anything else. If you are going to take big whacks out of a large organization, the longer time goes on, the more you have to plan, the bigger the cuts you can make. Now, let me say [CARDINAL] other thing. Other people talk about cut first and tax later; most of their cuts are in [DATE], too. They just want to pass them first and then avoid the tough decisions on the taxes. But if you look at the cuts that are proposed by others, if you look at Senator [PERSON]'s cuts on entitlements, almost all of them come in [DATE], the meaningful ones. That is where they come, except the proposals that would have raised the costs of health care to middle class [ORG] recipients or upper class ones. I am not against, for example, raising the premiums on Part B. That is what he called a spending cut. But if you are going to do it, it ought to be done in the context of overall health care reform and not just trying to get more money from those folks. I think we need to reform the health care system. The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. If you ask the people who say they are opposed to this but they understand the budget, they will tell you the following things: We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I am concerned that we should not do more. We have cut it quite deeply. There is an overall freeze on domestic spending. For example, that means every dollar we increase [ORG], every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion-those are the [CARDINAL] areas where we basically have increased-we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the [ORG] work force by [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] people in [DATE], and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that is flat. The only thing that is increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that is basically [ORG] and [ORG] and [ORG] cost of living. We have restrained [ORG] pay increases and [ORG] pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in [DATE]. So the real growth is in [ORG] and [ORG], in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do [CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL] things that I think are not good. [CARDINAL] is to charge middle class elderly people more for their [ORG] and much more if you are going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much [ORG] pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That is what is been going on for [DATE]. I guess I need to say this as clearly as I can: I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to [CARDINAL], you have to deal with entitlements. And it will require more spending cuts, not more tax increases beyond where we are. I agree with that. But my point is you do not get to that until you do this first. You have got to pass the budget first, then reform the health care spending in the country. Otherwise, what is going to happen with health care cuts, it is going to be very, very unfair to the elderly on [ORG] or to people who are paying private insurance. They are going to bear the costs. [ORG] and Super Collider [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. [INTERVIEWED], down here you are talking about budget cutting in [GPE]; that means [CARDINAL] things basically, the [ORG] and the space station. How do you see their future? Are they going to hang in there? And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep one and get rid of one? [INTERVIEWED] . Well, let me just say this. They are both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they are both important to the country. I think, if you are asking how they are doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a [ORG] vote. It was a narrow vote, as you probably know, the first time. The second time we got some more votes. But the first time we only carried it by a couple of votes when [CARDINAL] good friends of mine who went down to vote against it stayed to the end and changed their vote so we could save it because they knew it was important to me and, I think, to the country, as I said. So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It is very important in terms of new partnerships with [GPE] to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it is a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the [NORP] will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that [NORP] should have. So I think it is critically important. The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We do not know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits. It is in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the [ORG]. And the climate's not as good as it was [DATE] when it was saved. I think then-Senator [PERSON] clearly saved it in the [ORG] last time. It got beat by [CARDINAL] more votes in the [ORG] this time than it did [DATE]. I really do not know whether that is the real sentiment of the [ORG] or not. And then I do not know how much that had to do with the fact that, at the moment they were voting on the super collider, your Senators and Mr. [PERSON] were out on the steps of the [FAC] screaming at them to cut more spending, at the very moment the bill came up. I do not know whether that had anything to do with it or not, but I know it lost by [CARDINAL] more votes than it did [DATE]. And you know, it is pretty tense in the [ORG] now over a lot of these issues. But I am strongly supporting it. I am going to do what I can to pass it, and I think we have got a chance to pass it. The key to passing it, frankly, is asking the [ORG] to look at the national interest and look at the fact that we have to make a significant investment in nondefense research and development and technology. Now that we have cut defense a great deal and we have not offset all the cuts in technology with domestic investments in technology, and that is where a lot of these high wage jobs of the future come from, we cannot permit this to become a debate where the people in [GPE] took [PERCENT] of the base closing cuts last time and they complained that [GPE] took no cuts and that they are voting for new revenues and the [GPE] Senators want- I mean, if it becomes a deal, you know, a Stateby-State deal, I think it is gone. The only way we can save it is if people will recognize that it is in the national interest to do so. I am hoping we can do it. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. There is time for [CARDINAL] more question. [INTERVIEWED] . I cannot believe all these editorial writers do not have another question. Economic Program [INTERVIEWER1]. You spoke about now having more spending cuts than tax increases. I wonder if you could give us the figures, the current state of affairs. [INTERVIEWED] . Well, you know, they are still negotiating. It could change, but the last time I talked to Senator [PERSON] it was [MONEY] in spending cuts and [MONEY] or $[MONEY] in taxes, or something like that. They were at [MONEY]. And like I said, it could change in [DATE], but- I mean in [DATE] or so. You know, let me close by, if I might-you asked me a question when you started, and I did not really give you a very good answer about how I could get Senator [PERSON]'s vote. I think, frankly, he is worried about looking like he reversed himself from voting against it the first time, and I can understand that. But let me say, without identifying anybody, if you look at the people who have opposed the program or the people who voted for it with reluctance, their basic objections break down into [CARDINAL] categories. [CARDINAL] is a political one, pure and simple: I think this is the right thing to do for the country, and I hope it passes, but I am scared I will get beat if I vote for it. And we have tried to help in several ways: first of all, by recreating an aggressive communications strategy, more like what we did in the campaign, to try to combat what we think are false claims against this plan and just to get the information out about it; and secondly, to ask everybody to imagine what it is going to be like, not [DATE] after the vote but after we have had a chance to continue our spending cut program through the Vice President's reinventing Government initiative and through other cuts that will come when we have got a chance to deal with health care and welfare reform and the crime bill and these other issues. Then there is a whole second category of people who say that this is okay, this is a legitimate and honest effort to do better, and it does, but it does not do enough. Senator [PERSON], for example-we have got [ORG] on here- Senator [PERSON] is sort of in that category, you know, said you have got to deal with entitlement costs, too. And my argument to that group of people-and that is the argument that Senator [PERSON] made [DATE]-is that you are right, it does not do enough. But that is not a good reason to vote against this because what it does is very good, indeed. And unless you do this, you cannot get to the second stage. That is, I completely agree we have to control entitlement costs and that that begins overwhelmingly with [ORG] and [ORG] costs. I just do not think it is fair or right to do it unless it is part of an overall health care reform plan which brings down the cost of health care to all [NORP] and stops cost-shifting and does not impose unfair burdens on elderly people on [ORG]. And my argument is, we are just beginning this process; we are not ending it. But if we do not pass this budget now, we will fool around here for [DATE] debating the same old thing. We will wind up with a program that may be marginally different than the one we have got, but it will in all probability have much less deficit reduction if we have to go into some sort of situation where we are paralyzed on this. So the real issue here-I think the reason that we have had so many [NORP] as well as [NORP] business leaders supporting this is that they want a decision, they want certainty, they want real deficit reduction, and they think this meets all those criteria and also has some real incentives to grow the economy, and it will free us to move on to these other things. That is what I keep emphasizing to Members of [ORG] who say this is not perfect. I say, look, we have got a [DATE] contract here to deal with all these problems, and you cannot expect this one bill to solve all the problems of the country. It will not carry that much water. But this is very, very important, but only a first step. Health Care Reform [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. [INTERVIEWED], since you brought up health care reform, what do you say to reassure [NORP]-looming over this budget package with its various tax increases is the specter of more increases to pay for health care. How can you reassure [NORP] that they are not getting ready to get hit by a [CARDINAL] punch? [INTERVIEWED] . First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured. Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what is going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I do not , myself, think that it is right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we are going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we are going to bring our costs down, we have got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too. But my own view of that is that the best way to do that is to limit the ultimate cost to small business and phase any new requirements in over a period of years so that nobody is adversely affected too much. But let me say on that point, it is important to remember that [PERCENT] of the small businesses in [GPE] already provide some coverage to their employees. Most of them pay too much for too little coverage because of the way our insurance market is organized. Most of them, in other words, are disadvantaged by the present system. For those who do not provide any coverage for themselves or their employees, they still get health care. But if they cannot pay for it, the cost of that health care is simply shifted onto everybody else by the providers. So my argument there is that we are going to do this with extreme sensitivity to the economy. I think that most business groups will like this program. I think most provider groups will like the program. And I think everybody recognizes that there is something badly wrong when we are spending [PERCENT] of our income as a country [DATE] on health care and no other country in the world except for [GPE] is even over 9. They are just barely over [CARDINAL]. We are competing with the [NORP], who are at [CARDINAL], and the [NORP], who are [PERCENT] of their income. And with no discernible effect on our life expectancy or anything else-we have got some serious problems they do not have. Now, we will never get down to where they are because we have more poor people, more violence, and because for good reasons we emphasize more technology and breakthroughs. So we will never get down to where they are, but we have got to bring these costs under control or the deficit will never get down to [CARDINAL], and we cannot really restore the competitiveness of our private sector. So I would say that people should look forward to this with eagerness. Also, this is not going to be jammed through the [ORG] [TIME]. We are going to have an honest and open debate on this. I want the [NORP] community to sit down and really visit about this health care thing and talk it through. This is not going to be some sort of a blitzkrieg deal. We are going to take some time and really discuss it and debate it, just as we have for [DATE]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}

So, [INTERVIEWED] , my first question to you is, how do you feel? Do you feel you have accomplished your goal by this first trip ever made by a [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] to a reunified [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I think it was a very successful trip; first, because we were able to see and support the attempts that are being made there to recover the missing in action from the [GPE] conflict and to continue our cooperation with [ORG] in that regard. We also gave them [CARDINAL] pages of documents to help them identify the [CARDINAL], 000 people still missing who are [NORP]. Then, I think it was important because we contributed, I believe, to the continuing economic progress of the country which I think will lead to more openness. And thirdly, I think it was important because I was able to speak on television to the country about the kind of future I hope we will share with [GPE] and the fact that I hope there will be more openness and more freedom in it. And I also had, finally, some very good discussions and some constructive disagreements with the leadership of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED] 's Impressions of [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Your speech at [ORG] certainly was very impressive. And so I think that made a really big impression on the country. As this was your first trip to [GPE], could you give us a general impression of the country, at least what you saw of it, and of the people? Were they warm and welcoming? [INTERVIEWED]. They were very warm and very welcoming and clearly interested in the trip. And the young people with whom I talked were clearly interested in having closer ties with [GPE]. So I felt very good about that. I also was interested in all the changes that are occurring in the northern part of the country. I think there is clearly a lot of new investment going on in [GPE], a lot of new businesses coming out, a lot of changes there that I think will tend to make the south and the north perhaps less different in terms of the economic lives and maybe the political outlooks of the people at least in the cities. Now, the only village that I went to was the one where the search for the pilot was going on. [PERSON] of Vietnam [INTERVIEWER]. People say that, in [GPE], it is still some distance between the potential and realization. Do you get a feeling that the people are impatient for progress, especially among the young, or do you think, as the Government says, that they are pretty satisfied with the present pace of things? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would say that they understand that the country is doing better, and they like that. But my impression is that they want to move forward as rapidly as they can. After all, [PERCENT] of the country now is [DATE]. And I think they have a keen awareness that they have to make a lot of changes in order to keep creating jobs. I think they need [CARDINAL] new jobs [DATE]. On [TIME] of my last day there, I had an amazing roundtable discussion with a number of young [NORP] men and women who ranged in age from [DATE] to [DATE], and who did everything from working for [ORG], the big international grain company, to running the [GPE] office of [ORG] and [ORG], which is a big [GPE] advertising agencyexcuse me. Then there was [CARDINAL] young man who had a job in the party and others who had other jobs. But what was interesting to me is, they were all thinking about the big questions, you know, how much personal freedom is needed in life, what kinds of decisions should be made by the individual, and what kind of decisions should be made by families or villages or the nation, the Government, and how much of the economy should be private and how much should be public. The man who runs the city government in [GPE] was quite proud of the fact that they had done a remarkable job of creating jobs in the private sector, that he had downsized the government, that poverty had been reduced by [PERCENT], and homelessness was reduced by [PERCENT]. So I think there are a lot of people there who have this feeling that if they go more to a private economy and they have more entrepreneurial spirit, that there will also be more personal freedom associated with it. First Lady's Discussion of Human Rights [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. I understand that the First Lady also had some strong words to recommend human rights at her talk in [TIME] of [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. She met with a group of women there. It was something she tries to do in every country in the world she visits. She is been speaking about that, especially as human rights affect women and young girls, ever since she went to the Beijing Women's Conference [DATE]. [GPE] Bilateral Trade Agreement [INTERVIEWER]. That is wonderful. Now, what is your reading of the progress so far made about the [GPE] bilateral trade agreements? Did you get any indication while you were there as to when [ORG] might get to ratify that? [INTERVIEWED]. I think they will ratify it pretty soon. I thinkI had the feeling they want to make absolutely sure that we are going to ratify it. And they understand that the timing is not good for ratification now, but I think as soon as we ratify it, they will. And then I think that we told them that we would be spending [MONEY] a year over [DATE] to help ensure the rapid and thorough implementation of the agreement. And we told them that we would like to have a high-level meeting, at least [DATE], to plot a joint economic strategy for the future, and they agreed to that. So my instinct is that they do want to get the maximum benefits out of this trade agreement. [INTERVIEWER]. But then, what would be your impression as to when [ORG] might ratify that? [INTERVIEWED]. I think they will do it as soon as they have a chance, probably [DATE]. You know, I wish I could do it now, but I just do not know if it is practical. So I think that I do not think there is any shot that it will not be approved by the [ORG]. There is just too much support for it. Press Secretary [PERSON]. Last question, please. Discussions With [NORP] Leaders [INTERVIEWER]. [Inaudible]being very diplomatic in handling the question of human rights, religious, and other democratic freedoms in [GPE]. But [GPE]'s sensitivity to this question is all too obvious. Did you make any headway in your talk with Secretary General [PERSON] or Prime Minister [PERSON] on this front, or do you think the [GPE] could work with [GPE] on this matter in a more open fashion? [INTERVIEWED]. I had very open conversations with all of them, with the Prime Minister, with the Secretary General and [INTERVIEWED]. And what I believe is that once they realize that we are not trying to tell [GPE] how to run every aspect of their lives and that we feel that we are going to be in a friendly relation, we have to be honest about our disagreements, and we have to say what we think human rights and religious rights and individual freedom have meant to our country. I think we will be in a dialog there, and I think that, plus the process of economic and social change which is going on in [GPE] will lead the country in a positive direction. That is what I believe. I think it will be very important for my successor to continue that dialog. I do not think we can drop human rights or religious freedom from our concerns anywhere in the world. [INTERVIEWER]. Can we ask you just [CARDINAL] last quick question [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. Musicians in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Did you have a chance to play your saxophone while you were there? [INTERVIEWED]. No. But I love the music. I didhowever, I heard a [NORP] saxophone player at the entertainment after the state dinner, and he was really, really good. All the musicians were great. I was very impressed by the musical performances that were done after the state dinner. [INTERVIEWER]. You would not allow us maybe just Press Secretary [PERSON]. No, I think we have to wrap up. Sorry. [INTERVIEWED]. We are in [GPE], and we have to get back on the plane to go home. I am sorry. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED] [INTERVIEWED]. Goodbye.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithniletvegypt", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for talking to [NORP] television. [INTERVIEWED], you are coming to [GPE] [DATE], and you are meeting with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and a number of other [NORP] leaders. What are you going to tell them? What role do you see the [NORP] countries playing in the coming stage? [INTERVIEWED]. First, I want to thank [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] for his hospitality. He has been telling me about the beauty of [GPE] for a long time, and now I am going to get to see it firsthand. [INTERVIEWER]. You will love it. [INTERVIEWED]. I am looking forward to it. The first thing I want to do is to make it very clear to the leaders in the neighborhood that I am intent upon working toward a [CARDINAL]-state solution in the Middle East [CARDINAL] states, [GPE] and [GPE], living side by side in peace. In other words, I want them to look me in the eye so they can see that I am determined to work to make this happen. I am also going to remind them [GPE] cannot do this alone. We obviously need [NORP] support. We obviously need the new Prime Minister of [ORG]'s work and help. And we need countries like [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and others to work together to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to prevent the killers from moving around, to help provide security, and as a [NORP] state emerges, to support Prime Minister [PERSON]' regime with not only advice but, when necessary, development aid so an economy can start to grow in a [NORP] state. [INTERVIEWED]'s Commitment to Peace Process [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], let me follow up on that. You said you are determined to bring peace, you are committed, personally committed to the roadmap, and you are personally involved in the roadmap. That has sort of a different approach from the approach that the administration had adopted at the beginning, which was a hands-off approach, the peace process. The question is, how long would that commitment and involvement, personal involvement, last and how deep is it? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think it is not a fair characterization to say we were hands-offquite the contrary. I took an assessment of what was possible and realized that it was impossible to achieve peace with Chairman [PERSON]. He is failed the [NORP] people in the past. My predecessor tried hard, and I watched very carefully what was tried at [FAC]. Now, having said that, I also was working with the parties to try to set the conditions necessary for the emergence of a [NORP] government with whom we could work, so we would not waste time, so that actually some progress could be made. So the people have got to know when I say something, I mean it. Hopefully by now people have learned that, that when [PERSON] commits [GPE] to a project, we mean that, we do not have idle chit-chat, that we are serious about our intentions. [INTERVIEWER]. So the [NORP], or the people in the region should not really be worrying about voices within your administration who are opposed to serious efforts by [GPE] [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, they do not have to worry about that, because I am going to put the effort forward. [INTERVIEWER]. So you do not listen to them? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it sounds like they do not listen to me, because when I say something, I mean it. And I think [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] knows that. And I am going to refresh their memories about the kind of administration I try to run. When I say something, we actually go do it. And when I say that I am going to be involved in the peace process, I mean I am going to be involved in the peace process. Now, I understand it is going to be tough and difficult, but I believe it can happen. And I want to work toward achieving [CARDINAL] states, so that the [NORP] suffering and humiliation ends. [INTERVIEWER]. And [INTERVIEWED], how do you see the future of the [NORP]-American relations, the strategical relations that binded those [CARDINAL] countries over [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Strong, I think, a good future. Listen, we have counted on [GPE], and [GPE] counts on [GPE]. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. Throughout my Government, people deal with the [NORP] authorities, and I think it is in our interests, our national interest to keep a strong relationship with [GPE], and I intend to do so. [INTERVIEWER]. Right. We are looking forward to seeing you, [INTERVIEWED], in [GPE]. Thank you very much for your time. [INTERVIEWED]. It is going to be an exciting trip, and I look forward to the hospitality of the [NORP] people. And I want to assure the people of [GPE] that the relationship is an important relationship between [GPE] and [GPE]. And I want to assure your listeners that when I come to the region, I come with peace in mind and the possibilities of peace between the [NORP] and the [NORP] is real in my mind, and I am going to work toward that objective.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithninatotenbergnationalpublicradio", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]. , Judge [PERSON] was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before? [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, I think [PERSON] is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation. And it is a testimony to how good he is that, you know, he has cropped up as a potential [ORG] justice for a very long time. I have always been a huge admirer of his. I have always felt that the way he approaches cases the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building were qualities that would make him an outstanding [ORG] justice. This moment in our history a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges. And so although I have always believed that he would make an outstanding [ORG] justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that [ORG] is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring or at least increasing the [NORP] people's confidence in our justice system. [INTERVIEWER]. Did you talk to him about being a piata, as Sen. [PERSON] put it? [INTERVIEWED]. . We had a very candid conversation. He is chief judge of [ORG], so I assume that he either reads [ORG] or listens to [ORG], and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader [PERSON] took immediately after Justice [PERSON]'s passing the notion that the [NORP] senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how. I am sure that he is aware that, [DATE], massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates not just for [ORG], but for appellate court judges. [INTERVIEWER]. But he is not he is not a pol. [INTERVIEWED]. . No, he is not . And so we discussed that, and I wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we are we call folks like Judge [PERSON] civilians. And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they are mindful of. But, you know, I think the way he described it and I will let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He is got a great job. And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he is built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it is important. And I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he is shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we are at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we are going to be. [INTERVIEWER]. By the way, when did you offer him the job? [INTERVIEWED]. . Over [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, he is a very good actor because I had dinner with him [DATE] [TIME] [at a small charity event], and he looked like he kept just was saying he was not going to get it. [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, you know, I I that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting being nominated for [ORG], it is probably always wise to not count your chickens before they are hatched. [INTERVIEWER]. But you just told me they were hatched. [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, I am not sure about that. [INTERVIEWER]. In the heat of ... [INTERVIEWED]. . I might have called him right after dinner. [INTERVIEWER]. In the heat of a [INTERVIEWED]. ial campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of [NORP] saying that they will not give your nominee a hearing? They clearly do not want to look rude, so they will meet with him and tell him that they do not want to meet with him. But but how do you keep it up there? When [ORG], frankly I have written more pieces in my life saying, [DATE] it may be an issue, and then it never really is. [INTERVIEWED]. . [DATE] it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been [INTERVIEWED]. ial campaign season so far. I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we have seen in [INTERVIEWED]. ial race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in [GPE]. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything. And when you then have add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the [ORG] saying, I will not meet with a nominee; I will not provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for [DATE]. That matters to people. And so, you are right, [PERSON], that generally speaking, people are not closely following [ORG] cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if [NORP] stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and [INTERVIEWED]. s whether they are [NORP] or [NORP] are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the [ORG]. At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary because everybody understands that there is some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process. And so I we have seen already the surveys that say, number [CARDINAL], people are paying attention to this; and number [CARDINAL] it is not just [NORP], but a sizable number of [NORP] who vote against me, have said this is this cannot be the way we run our government. And what is particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they are not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions. There is nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the [ORG] nomination process in which for [DATE], we do not do that because there is an election going on. [PERSON] nominated a couple of [ORG] justices in [DATE]. And obviously [PERSON] had better poll numbers, I am sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you do not want to see this becoming degenerating into just a pure political battle. [INTERVIEWER]. So we have reported that [NORP] leading [NORP] senators sent a message sort of back-channel: OK, if you appoint [PERSON], we we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there is a [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. . Did that play any role in your decision? [INTERVIEWED]. . I have not had conversations like that. [INTERVIEWER]. No, I did not say you had. [INTERVIEWED]. . What I have seen are the public statements of leading [NORP] like [PERSON] broadly complimenting Judge [PERSON] as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to [ORG]. And ... [INTERVIEWER]. So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that [NORP] really do like him? [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, there is no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number [CARDINAL], I think he is the best person for the job. Number [CARDINAL], I think he is a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment. Justice [PERSON] was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when [ORG] has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it has not been divided just along [CARDINAL]-4 votes. And Judge [PERSON], if you look at his work on [ORG], has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that is a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by [NORP]. It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. I said I would play it straight that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job. And [PERSON] fits that bill. [INTERVIEWER]. Your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except [PERSON], was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. You picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he is sort of a centrist liberal. He is not, you know, he is not going to this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at [ORG]. What do you say to that those folks? [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I have made since I have been [INTERVIEWED]. of [GPE]. I have appointed as many [NORP] to [ORG] as any [INTERVIEWED]. ever; more [NORP] women on the federal courts than any other [INTERVIEWED]. ; more [NORP], more [NORP], more LGBT judges than any [INTERVIEWED]. in history. We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on [ORG], something that is never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched. When it comes to [ORG], I have appointed [CARDINAL] women, [CARDINAL] [NORP]. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, [PERSON] is the best person for the job. And I have confidence that without knowing how he is going to decide any particular case he is going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice. [INTERVIEWER]. What do you ask these folks in your interviews? I mean, you cannot say, So, what do you think of Roe v. Wade? That would be improper, right? [INTERVIEWED]. . I do not do that. [INTERVIEWER]. So, I am Judge [INTERVIEWER]. I am here for my interview. What are you going to ask me? What kinds of things do you ask? [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is. And when you hear Judge [PERSON]'s background when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the [GPE] bombing you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that. With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I do not need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases. [CARDINAL] thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem [DATE]? You know, so you will get some sense of their judicial philosophy. But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they have probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they should not talk about. [INTERVIEWER]. Let me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question. [INTERVIEWED]. . Sure. [INTERVIEWER]. You have said that neither party comes to this process clean. [INTERVIEWED]. . It is absolutely true. [INTERVIEWER]. And you voted to not end debate on the [PERSON] nomination. And if I understood you correctly at your press conference, what I thought I heard you say was, You know, I knew that it was a meaningless vote. You got a pass from the leadership. You can do this. But can you blame the [NORP] who look at this nomination and say, There is going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we do not like that shift in the court. So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they will win [INTERVIEWED]. ial nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, would not the [NORP] do the same? They called they are all already calling it the [PERSON] rule. [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from [PERSON] when he was on [ORG] if you actually read the speech, number [CARDINAL], he was speaking hypothetically. [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, [PERSON]. Oops. [INTERVIEWED]. . Should we start that one over? [INTERVIEWER]. Yeah, let us do that. [INTERVIEWED]. . Wow, [PERSON]. You are supposed to turn off your phone. [INTERVIEWER]. I am not I am supposed to be a pro. [INTERVIEWED]. . Come on. [INTERVIEWER]. Come on. [INTERVIEWED]. . The, uh ... [INTERVIEWER]. It is the office. [INTERVIEWED]. . I am assuming you can just splice the question and I will just answer it, so [PERSON] does not have to answer ask it again. [INTERVIEWER]. Yeah. [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, first of all, if you look at what [PERSON] actually said [DATE], he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a [ORG] opening, then his advice to a [INTERVIEWED]. in [DATE] would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate. Well, you know what? That is exactly what I have done. And so there is no contradiction between what I am doing and what [PERSON] suggested a [INTERVIEWED]. in my circumstances should do. Number [CARDINAL], with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge [PERSON]'s views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of [PERSON], we have not seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence. This is just raw politics. We do not want somebody who is been nominated by a [NORP] a claim that I would have never made at the time. Now what is true, [PERSON], is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice [PERSON] was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that [NORP] senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee. Here is the problem we have, though: If in fact we have gotten to the point where they cannot confirm somebody because a [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. is nominating them, what is to stop them from saying [DATE], We have got another excuse for not confirming a [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. 's nominee ? And at that point the process has broken down. [NORP] have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which [NORP] have left a seat open when a [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. was in office simply because they did not like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court. Justice [PERSON] was confirmed by [PERSON], and I am quite certain that there were a whole lot of [NORP] senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in [DATE] of [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON]'s office. So we actually have evidence we have proof, not that [NORP] are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of [ORG], and the integrity of the institution, not just [ORG], but the integrity of the [ORG], and the office of [INTERVIEWED]. , requires them to do their job. And my simple pitch to them is, be fair not to ignore politics. I am not demanding that [NORP] vote for [PERSON], but do not stop the process in its tracks because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it is got to stop. A good place for it to stop is when we are talking about a [ORG] seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the [NORP] themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you taking this on the road? [INTERVIEWED]. . Well, you know, I am going to make the case I am going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge [PERSON] a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That is what the [NORP] people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I have heard from [PERSON] and some other [NORP] is this notion that the [NORP] people should decide we should let the [NORP] people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat. Well in fact, the [NORP] people did decide, back in [DATE] when they elected me [INTERVIEWED]. with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the [NORP] would be in the majority. They did not say, We are going to decide that you are in charge for [DATE], and then in [DATE] you all take a break. They said, No, you are [INTERVIEWED]. for [DATE], and Mr. [PERSON], you are going to be the leader, because we have given you a majority in the [ORG]. So the [NORP] people already have decided. They have already weighed in. They will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next [INTERVIEWED]. will fill that vacancy. The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, [PERSON], which is that they do not want a [NORP] filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a [NORP] to fill the seat. But one of the things that is broken down in our politics is a recognition that you do not always get your way [PERCENT] of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the [NORP] people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as [INTERVIEWED], I have had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency. And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they are not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that is not what made us the greatest country on Earth. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]. , thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it. [INTERVIEWED]. . I enjoyed it, [PERSON]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}

Well, yes, I do. Number [CARDINAL], we are looking forward very much to our trip, which will begin [DATE]. And this will be the third time that we have had the opportunity of visiting [GPE], so we are looking forward to this return. But I think the message that. I would have is that the close friendship that we do have ans the relationship, overall, imposes have and the relationship on [GPE] and [GPE] a responsibility to the world to foster peace and prosperity. Between us, [GPE] and [GPE] are responsible for [CARDINAL] of all the gross national product of the world. We are the [CARDINAL] greatest trading partners our relationship between each other that way. But we can make such a contribution to easing the tensions in the world and bringing the prosperity and the peace that I think the people of all the world want. Some governments may not want that, but the people want it. And between us, as I say, we have a great duty. [INTERVIEWER]. You are now having the most difficult and egregious time as [INTERVIEWED]. . What are the real, major objectives of your trip to [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that we have a number of things that we need to talk about, because we are such close friends and allies. I think, for [CARDINAL] thing, we have some differences with regard to trade. And as we discussed when Prime Minister [PERSON] was here for the [GPE] summit, we discussed the need for all the world to get away from the idea of protectionism in trade, trying to maintain an advantage over someone else. The great growth and prosperity of [GPE] in trade and industry is due to the idea of democracy and free trade. And so free trade must also be fair trade. And I am concerned that here in our own country some of the restraints on our exports to your country have led some to a feeling of protectionism and that they must do something in retaliation. I feel that as we loosen the restraints between us in trade, that is the answer to those who could give us political problems in both our countries to the Prime Minister, to myself, here. So, we will be discussing all those ways in which we can restore that trade. We have between us the biggest trade between any [CARDINAL] countries in the world. And there is a dangerous imbalance now in that trade. So, those will be some of the things that I hope to be discussing. [INTERVIEWER]. While some [NORP] feel our country should be unarmed and neutral, Prime Minister [PERSON] considers cooperation between [GPE] and [GPE] absolutely necessary to [NORP] peace and security. I would appreciate your comment on this. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I agree with Prime Minister [PERSON] very much. The Pacific Basin is the area of the future, and [GPE] I recognize you have some constitutional problems with this but a strong [GPE], a [GPE] able to manage more of its own defense, will be a great factor for stability in that whole area. And while we are talking peace, there are some who seem to suggest that if you are talking military strength, you are talking against peace. Well, I do not know of anyone that ever got into a war because they were too strong. What we need is to be able to deter others who are destabilizing the forces, such as from [GPE] with their attempts at expansionism. What we need is to have the military strength to deter aggression at the same time that we try to convince the aggressors that they, too, will be better off in a peaceful world. So yes, we appreciate very much what [GPE] has done in increasing their own defense. I know that a goal, and one I hope they will achieve soon, is to be able to protect for [QUANTITY] around your trade lines and your supply lines. And we want to continue the relationship we have in that regard. [INTERVIEWER]. Trade friction between [GPE] and [GPE] is serious. Do you sometimes worry that it may influence bilateral relations between our [CARDINAL] countries? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am afraid I almost answered that question in advance to your earlier question there. Yes, those restrictions which I mentioned [TIME]. We must find where, fairly, we can reconcile the differences between our currencies. We must remove restrictions that impair trade back and forth, and we must just as we are friends and allies in everything else we must have that same kind of approach to our trade with each other, our opening of our capital markets to each other for investment. [INTERVIEWER]. [NORP] relations with [GPE] and [GPE] influence our own relations with them. Could you discuss current [NORP] policy toward these [CARDINAL] countries? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, with regard to [GPE], we are working very hard to establish a stronger relationship, one that has always in the past characterized the relationship between our country and [GPE]. I think we have been making great progress. Prime Minister [PERSON] will be visiting here [DATE], and [DATE] I expect to visit [GPE] myself. With [GPE], we have to recognize there that there is where we must have the strength to deter aggression. They seem bent on worldwide expansionism. They have [CARDINAL] divisions on the [NORP] border. They have [CARDINAL] SS-20 nuclear missiles on that border. They have the largest fleet, the largest of their fleets is in the Pacific, in the area of both [GPE] and [GPE]. So, there we must have the patience to convince them that peace would be to their advantage, also. And in the meantime, the only way to protect the peace is to have the strength to deter. But we are very pleased with the progress we have made with [GPE] in establishing friendship there. [INTERVIEWER]. You and I happen to be the same age. I, too, was born in [DATE]. You and I also share a deep commitment to democracy and freedom, and we long for peace around the world. It seems, however, that the forces of violence and hate are growing. What are the prospects for peace in the world, despite recent tragedies in [GPE], [GPE], and [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Those tragic events recently, the terrorist acts, what has happened to our men in [GPE], are all evidences of how necessary it is for those of us who can, for countries like [GPE] and [GPE], to erase the causes of such hatred and to work ceaselessly for peace. Yes, you and I were born in [DATE]. I like to think it was [DATE]. But we have had an opportunity to see war and peace throughout [DATE], to see how foolishly sometimes war came upon us, and at the same time to see the spread of democracy and what it has brought. When you look at your own country, when you look at [GPE], when you look at [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] and see where the principles of free commerce and trade, the principles of democracy are at work, how much better off they are than those countries that have followed the totalitarian path of communism and statism. So, I think that while things can look dark and threatening, I think the very fact that there is awareness now on the part of many of us who have seen the other, that yes, we can bring peace. We can prove the need for it. And I think there is more awareness in the world [DATE] that in order to have peace we must have strength. So, I am not discouraged by what is going on. [INTERVIEWER]. Many people, both here and in the rest of the world, now refer to [GPE] as an economic superpower. Within the overall context of [GPE] relations, what are your principal expectations for this new, more powerful [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well and I think this is a classic example for the world there is [CARDINAL] superpower in the world [DATE] that is recognized as such simply because of its military strength and not because of any achievements that it has made in commerce and industry or the living standard of its people. In fact, to maintain their military strength, that power has denied the comforts of living to its people. On the other hand, you are the second industrial and commercial power in the world. So in that sense you have become a superpower in the peaceful pursuits of commerce and trade and good living for your people. And that is well deserved. That is why we are allies. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for the opportunity. [INTERVIEWER]. Have a nice trip to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. We are looking forward to it. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER]. See you in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. I look forward to it. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnorahodonnellcbsthismorning", "text": "You ran for [INTERVIEWED] promising to end the war in [GPE]. Right. You did. Yeah. It ended [DATE]. Right. And at the time, you said [GPE] was sovereign, stable and self-reliant. Yeah. And now you are redeploying troops, some troops, to [GPE]. Are you worried about your legacy in some ways, that there might be an establishment of a terrorist safe haven in the middle of the Middle East? Well, first of all, I think we did exactly what we should have done, which is to turn over to [GPE] a country that had the capacity, the ability to govern itself if all the parties involved [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP] were prepared to make compromises with each other. And I think the [NORP] people understood that whatever the debate about originally going in, our troops made enormous sacrifices to give the [NORP] people that chance. Unfortunately, that trust between those parties has never fully cohered. And now we are seeing some of the consequences of that. I mean, [ORG] is a group that is so extreme Mmm hmm. [acknowledging] it has been disavowed by [ORG] as being too violent. Right. How urgent of a threat to the [NORP] people is [ORG]? I think it is fair to say that their extreme ideology poses a medium- and long-term threat. Right now the problem with [ORG] is the fact that they are destabilizing a country that could spill over into some of our, you know, allies, like [GPE], and that they are engaged in wars in [GPE] where, in that vacuum that is been created, they could amass more arms, more resources. Would that vacuum exist had we backed the moderate rebel forces in [GPE]? Yes. I think this notion that somehow there was this ready-made moderate [NORP] force that was able to defeat [PERSON] is simply not true. The notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn, you know, not only [PERSON], but also ruthless, highly trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms, is a fantasy. [break] This is the first ever [ORG] summit on working families. I know you said in your State of the Union, when women succeed, [GPE] succeeds. What is the single most important thing you think you can do to help working women? Well, the question is not just what I can do, but I think what we as a society need to do. And this is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. I was raised by a single mom. Probably the most important financial bedrock of our family was my grandmother. And both of them were strong, hard-working women, but they experienced the glass ceiling. They dealt with child-care crises. I am now married to a pretty strong woman in [PERSON]. And before we got to this place, she was dealing sometimes with me campaigning or being away and her having to deal with [CARDINAL] small children while also working. And now I have got [CARDINAL] daughters. So I want to make sure that they are able to balance family life and the workplace much better than or at least their choices will be better than some of the choices that existed before. So the idea of this working summit is to really lift up conversations that every family all across [GPE] has [DATE]. The workplace will be more productive and people will do better if, in fact, they have got a little more flexibility than they currently have. I mean, you look at, even as your you know, your oldest daughter does an internship do you look and say, wow, much has not changed, and this is kind of a problem, and I do not want my daughter to have to go through this? It is important for us not to deny the progress that is been made. You know, women occupy positions of authority and are able to take advantage of career opportunities that, [DATE], might have been blocked. What is also true is that, you know, all too often childrearing burdens fall on them. They have got to juggle more stuff. What is also true is that, across the board in the aggregate, women are making [MONEY] for every dollar that a man's making. Discrimination's still taking place. And so part of what we want to do is to lift up the possibilities of changes in federal policy. But we do not want to restrict it to just federal laws. We also want to show that companies on their own initiative will discover that it is good business sense for them to take advantage of or to offer workers more flexibility on the job. Why is it, then I mean, the majority of the [NORP] people back paid family leave that you cannot get it through [ORG]? Well, you know, we are we are unique among developed countries in not offering it. We have got, unfortunately, a faction of [CARDINAL] party that says no to everything. And maybe the summit can highlight that this is not a partisan issue. This is a middle- class issue. This is an [NORP] issue.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnovayagazeta", "text": "[CARDINAL]. Do you agree with the opinion expressed by many [NORP] and [NORP] politicians that [GPE] is primarily responsible for the economic difficulties that their countries are now living through? No. We all are experiencing a severe economic crisis that is affecting the lives of many people in countries around the world. This crisis resulted from a culture of irresponsibility regarding financial matters that took hold over [DATE] in [GPE], Europe and elsewhere. I am proud of our efforts to lead by reforming our regulatory and supervisory systems and promoting an era of responsibility, so that the [GPE] and global economies will be stable and growth will be sustained. We of course have an obvious interest in developing policies that stimulate economic growth in [GPE], but we also believe that economic growth in our country also will nurture economic growth around the world, including in [GPE]. In [DATE], we all -Americans, [NORP], and everyone else - have an interest in fostering world economic growth that benefits us all. We need to spend less time thinking about who is to blame and more time working together to do what needs to be done to get all of our economies moving in the right direction. [CARDINAL]. Do you agree that lies and greed - - lies about the state of markets and greed of their participants are the main reasons for the current economic crisis? As I said to [ORG] in [DATE], our economy did not fall into decline [TIME]. Nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for [DATE] that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil [DATE] than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings [DATE], yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before. In other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, [DATE], or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they could not afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Many experts believe that the 21st Century Financial Regulatory Reform you proposed may become the most significant innovation in the [GPE] financial system since the era of [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. What do you consider to be the most important element of this reform? Are we at the doorstep of new transparency of business and finances? Our regulatory and supervisory reform plans, announced [DATE], are sweeping and important. The plans include [CARDINAL] important components. First, we are proposing a set of reforms to require regulators to look not only at the safety and soundness of individual institutions, but also for the first time at the stability of the financial system as a whole. Second, we are proposing a new and powerful agency charged with just one job: looking out for ordinary consumers. Third, we are proposing a series of changes designed to promote free and fair markets by closing gaps and overlaps in our regulatory system including gaps that exist not just within but between nations. We are called upon to put in place those reforms that allow our best qualities to flourish while keeping those worst traits in check. We are called upon to recognize that the free market is the most powerful generative force for our prosperity but it is not a free license to ignore the consequences of our actions. [CARDINAL]. On [DATE] Senators [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON] and [PERSON] together with other Senators adopted Resolution 232 on the trial, sentence and imprisonment of [PERSON] and [PERSON]. The Resolution said that in investigations that present a threat to authorities, [NORP] courts become instruments of the [ORG], and cannot be responsible or independent. Have you been following the new trial of [PERSON] and [PERSON]? I do not know the intimate details of these new proceedings, though my advisors most certainly do. However, without knowing the details, it does seem odd to me that these new charges, which appear to be a repackaging of the old charges, should be surfacing now, [DATE] after these [CARDINAL] individuals have been in prison and as they become eligible for parole. Nonetheless, I think it is improper for outsiders to interfere in the legal processes of [GPE]. Instead, I would just affirm my support for [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]'s courageous initiative to strengthen the rule of law in [GPE], which of course includes making sure that all those accused of crimes have the right to a fair trial and that the courts are not used for political purposes. [CARDINAL]. Restarting the relationship implies cooperating with [GPE] in those areas where it is possible. Does this mean weaker attention to [GPE]'s observation of civil rights and liberties, and to persecution against and murders of journalists? Specifically, to [the need to] apprehend and punish those who ordered and committed the murder of journalist [PERSON]? Of course not. I seek to reset relations with [GPE] because I believe that [NORP] and [NORP] have many common interests, interests that our governments recently have not pursued as actively as we could have. For instance, I believe that [NORP] and [NORP] both would benefit from fewer nuclear weapons in the world, greater control over nuclear materials around the world, a defeat of extremist elements in [GPE] and [GPE], an [GPE] that produces nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons, and [GPE] that refrains from launching missiles and exploding nuclear weapons and instead returns to the negotiating table. I also believe that [NORP] and [NORP] have a common interest in the development of rule of rule, the strengthening of democracy, and the protection of human rights. As I said in my inaugural address: To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. I then emphasized in my [GPE] speech that I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and does not steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. These are not just [NORP] ideas; they are human rights. These are ideas embraced by your [INTERVIEWED] and your people. I agree with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] when he said that Freedom is better than the absence of freedom. So, I see no reason why we cannot aspire together to strengthen democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as part of our reset. [CARDINAL]. Will you sign the new START treaty if [GPE] conditions its signing upon non-deployment of the [GPE] missile defense system in Central Europe? In our meeting in [GPE] on [DATE], [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and I issued a joint statement on instructions for our negotiators for this new treaty. These instructions very explicitly did not mention missile defense as a topic of discussion for these negotiations. At the same time, we understand [NORP] sensitivities to this issue and have sent several high-level delegations to [GPE] over [DATE] to engage in a serious dialogue about [GPE] cooperation on missile defense. My government is completing a comprehensive review of all of our missile defense programs, including those in Europe. Given the threats around the world, especially those growing from [GPE] and [GPE], our goal is to enhance missile defense for [GPE] and our allies in Europe and elsewhere. As I have said many times, such a system has to work, be cost effective, and must address the real threats to [GPE] and our allies, not imaginary ones. When discussing our plans for Europe, we first and foremost are seeking to build a missile defense system that protects [GPE] and Europe from an [NORP] ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead. We are not building and will not build a system that is aimed to respond to an attack from [GPE]. Such thinking is simply a legacy of the Cold War. We have not yet decided how we will configure missile defense in Europe. But my sincere hope is that [GPE] will be a partner in that project. If we combine our assets on missile defense, [GPE], [GPE], and our allies will be much safer than if we go it alone. I see a great potential here, and I hope to have a robust discussion with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] about these possibilities for cooperation on missile defense when I am in [GPE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. In the course of your [INTERVIEWED]ial campaign, you competed with [PERSON]. Does this hinder your joint work now? Absolutely not. This is the beauty of democracy. Secretary [PERSON] and I engaged in a hard-fought, very competitive race for the nomination of our party. By the way, without question, these primaries made me a better candidate for the general election against Senator [PERSON]. But in democracies, once the election is over, then all [NORP] who care about our country get back to work. It was because of how well I got to know Secretary [PERSON] during our campaign that I knew she would be such an excellent Secretary of [ORG], and she has served our country with excellence.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithntvrussia", "text": "[INTERVIEWER1]. Good [TIME], [INTERVIEWED]. , although it is good [TIME] for [NORP] audience because of the time change. Your father is a World War II hero, the youngest [ORG] pilot. So how important [DATE] is for you, personally, and for your family? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for asking about my dad. He ishe was alike many in [GPE] and in [GPE] that were called upon to defend the world against nazism. And fortunately, he came home. And [DATE], the celebration in [GPE] will remind us all about the sacrifices of, in my case, an individual I love, but also a generation, a generation of men and women who made extraordinary efforts, inRussia's case to defend the homeland, in [GPE]'s case to work with allies to defeat [PERSON] as well as the [NORP]. And so it is [DATE] for me, personally, because it reminds me of the willingness of a young kid to go fight. But it also reminds me of the duty of my generation to work together to make the world a better place. [INTERVIEWER1]. The after-war Europe has been reshaped according to the Yalta Conference of [DATE], by the decision of [CARDINAL] very important personalities of this time, Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], and Mr. [PERSON]. How fair is it to hold only [GPE] responsible for all the misfortunes of Eastern Europe and [GPE] over the last? [INTERVIEWED]. Now, that is a very fair question. Obviously, it was a decision made at the end of the war. I think that the main complaint would be that the form of government that the [NORP] had to live under was not of their choosing. But no, there is no question [CARDINAL] leaders made the decision. [INTERVIEWER1]. So not only [GPE] the bad guy of history? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think everybody ought to bear theas historians look back at Yaltagot to recognize that it was you are rightly so in pointing it outit was not only the [NORP] leader but the [NORP] and [NORP] leader were at the table and agreed on the agreement. [INTERVIEWER1]. In [GPE], we are very concerned on the rise of neo-nazism in [NORP] when [NORP] war veterans are humiliated publicly, when monuments to [NORP] soldiers are vandalized, and at the same time, where, on [DATE], there is a plan to open the monument to [ORG], that is well known only for fightingnot only for fighting against [NORP] but also for quite ugly things that were common for [ORG] troops. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Well, look, there is I have got a message when I go to the Baltics, and that is it is important to respect democracy but, also, the respect of democracy is respect for minority rights. In other words, a true democracy is one that says minorities are important and that the will of the majority cannot trample the minority. And as to whether or not nations are honoring nazism, I mean, of course that should be rejected. [NORP] was defeated. We are celebrating the defeat of nazism. We do not want to see nazism return. It is an extremist point of view that believes that you should be able to trample the rights of minorities. It was the [NORP] who annihilated [CARDINAL] of [NORP], for example, and there is a classic example of the rights of minorities being trampled. And we must never forget the lessons of why we fought together in World War II. And so I am looking forward to delivering that message of tolerance. [INTERVIEWER1]. There is a question that has nothing to do with your visit to [GPE] but is very important to our country as an oil-producing country. Once you mentioned that you will be happy to find a magic wand and to cut the price on oil. So what oil price will be acceptable for [GPE], and what do you think is the chance of finding this magic wand? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I appreciateno, there is no magic wand. A soldier asked me, he said, Why do not you lower gasoline prices, as if the government controlled price. And in our country, the Government does not control price. And I told him, I said, If I had a magic wand, I would wave it and lower your price. But Ithat's not the way it works. This is a world based the price based upon supply and demand. And demand has been going up relative to supply, which has been beneficial for oil-producing countries like [GPE]. And I do not know what the right price is. Obviously, the lower the better for our economy, because every time the money the dollars go up on the gasoline price, money leaves the pocketbooks of the working people. But that is the way the economy works. Hopefully, higher price will stimulate more production. More production will then help the price reach an equilibrium. And the market is what it is. That is the markets decide, not governments. I would hope that [GPE] would encourage a lot of investment, to open up the vast reserves she has. We need to do more exploration here. I spoke to the Crown Prince of [GPE] who assured me that he is trying to put moreto find more oil. And that is what high prices do. But people who have got oil have got to understand if the price gets too high, it could wreck economies, which will mean there is less purchasing power for the product. [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. , and welcome to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Looking forward to it. Thank you, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpakistanijournalists", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks for coming. I am looking forward to going to [GPE]. I appreciate the courage of your [INTERVIEWED] I am looking forward to my visit with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I am trying to think of the number of times I have met with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] since I have been [INTERVIEWED]. I would say [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] times. I remember our visit to [FAC]. [INTERVIEWER] I was there. [INTERVIEWED]. He is were you there? [INTERVIEWER] Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. I appreciate his courage. I appreciate the difficult job he has. I appreciate his commitment to joining the world in dealing with [NORP] radicals who will murder innocent people to achieve an objective. I appreciate the fact that he has stood strong in the face of several attempts on his life. I also appreciate our relationship with [GPE] and his vision for a democracy in [GPE]. And so I am looking forward to the trip. The Prime Minister was here [DATE]. We had a very good talk. And he was laying the groundwork for what I think will be a constructive visit. Be glad to answer some questions. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], I will start with the cartoon controversy. You and your allies work very hard on bridging the gap between the [NORP] and the [NORP] world, but the publication of a few cartoons in a remote newspaper seems to have undone everything. Why? [INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I think it is very important for people around the world to know that a free press is important for a democratic state; a free press for peaceful states as well. Free press holds people to account. Free press makes sure that there is a check and a balance on people in power. Free press also must be a responsible press. Secondly, I fully understand people taking not liking the cartoons. On the other hand, I do not believe that people should use that as a pretext for violence, nor do I appreciate the fact that some are using manipulating the anger over the cartoons to achieve political ends. And therefore, it is very important for governments to not allow policy to be set by those who are cynically manipulating the anger that some have felt over these cartoons. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], you have announced this global nuclear energy initiative, and this is the one that you have offered to [GPE] also. And you have spoken about the countries countries like [GPE] can also get a benefit of this initiative. Do you have [GPE] in mind [GPE] already saying that this offer to [GPE] is [GPE]-specific? Is it [GPE]-specific, or [GPE] can also be included in this initiative? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we are starting with [GPE], and [CARDINAL] of the primary reasons why is that [GPE] is in need of a diversification away from fossil fuels. [GPE] is consuming a lot of fossil fuel. That is driving up the price of a part of the reasons why the price is rising. [GPE] uses a lot of fossil fuels. [GPE] is using more fossil fuels. [GPE] is using more fossil fuels, and it is affecting the price of energy in [GPE] and in [GPE] and in [GPE]. And so therefore, to the extent to which we can get these fast-growing, developing nations to use something other than fossil fuels, it is in the world's interest, and it is in [GPE]'s interest as well. Now and so I would not view some say, Well, this is a [CARDINAL]-sum attitude by [GPE], quite the contrary. It is the beginning of a policy that says, there will be a suppliers group of people who are capable of providing fuel stocks for a civilian nuclear power industry, countries that will then collect the spent fuel, reprocess it to be able to burn it in new types of reactors. The purpose of this whole initiative, and beginning with countries like [GPE], is to recognize that alternative sources of energy are going to be important for the development of a clean world and a world that becomes substantially less reliant on nonrenewable sources of energy. [INTERVIEWER] But [GPE] cannot be included in that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I said, this is just the beginning of a very long process. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], in your speech, you talked about Kashmir dispute, and you said that you would like [GPE] and [GPE] to take bilateral steps to resolve the dispute. [GPE] has made certain proposals, but they are not reciprocated by [GPE]. And it seems that this bilateral is not going anywhere; there is need for a third-party mediation or some sort of help. Do you have any specific proposals for that? [INTERVIEWED]. First, I'd like to make sure I clarify my statement for all to read. [GPE] supports a solution that is acceptable to all sides since you are probably the only person in the room that paid attention to my speech the speech, as you know, I said, to both sides. The language should be all sides, because it recognizes that a solution must be acceptable to [GPE], [GPE], and those living within Kashmir. Our position is one that says a dispute that has been so long in a nation's history can best be resolved when [CARDINAL] nations make the determination to sit down and come up with a solution that is acceptable to all sides. Of course, during my discussions, I will encourage that dialog to go forward. I am convinced that history changes, and as history changes, attitudes can change, circumstances change, and that we have a possibility to see this issue resolved by strong and courageous leaders. I am pleased to see the amount of trade that is taking place between [GPE] and [GPE]. It is a substantial increase from [DATE] to [DATE]. I thought that the the new transportation routes between [GPE] and [GPE] are hopeful signs. And so the role of [GPE], in our judgment, is one that will help lead to a settlement that is acceptable to all sides. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], you also spoke about democracy in [GPE]; some distance has to be covered. And the [GPE] has recently asked Mr. [PERSON] [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] that he must decide by [DATE] whether he wants to continue as the Chief of Army Staff or as the [INTERVIEWED], [CARDINAL] decision. Is [GPE] comfortable with a leader who is also the Chief of Army Staff in a democracy? Does it bother you that he his contribution as the Chief of Army Staff? [INTERVIEWED]. I have had discussions with the [INTERVIEWED] quite frequently about his vision for a democratic [GPE]. And I am I believe that he is headed for a continue to head for on the road of reform. And he understands the pressures being put on him. As you said, the [ORG] spoke, and I believe that he is committed to having a reform process come to fruition, and I believe he is committed to free and open elections. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], there is another issue that is particularly sensitive for both [GPE] and [GPE], which is that [GPE] [GPE]-[GPE]-Pakistan gas pipeline. As we said, [GPE] need alternative sources of energy. So is it possible that decision, allow the construction of the pipeline? [INTERVIEWED]. What is important is that [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] work together to send a firm message to the [NORP] that a development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. You know, we energy supplies are important for [GPE], and they are important for [GPE]. I fully understand that. But a country which has been unwilling to adhere to treaties that it is agreed to, a country the [INTERVIEWED] of which has said the destruction of [GPE] is in part of foreign policy, a country which has not told the truth when it comes to whether or not they are enriching uranium or not, is a country that free nations need to deal with in a diplomatic way. And the best thing that the [NORP] can hear is a unified message from all of us. [INTERVIEWER] Does it mean that at some date you could decide to take military action against [GPE]? Would you [INTERVIEWED]. Diplomacy is our first option. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], the recent incident in which [GPE] military made a strike in the [NORP] tribal area in the Bajaur area. This has happened before also, and there was some outrage in [GPE] that there was no remorse from [ORG] on the action. These actions, when they are taken, is it because the unilateral action that the folks on the other side do not trust their colleagues on the side of the border, or it is the timing, is it intelligence, or the lack of operational capabilities on the side on the [NORP] side, that such actions are taken? [INTERVIEWED]. We are we are partners in the war against terrorists, some of whom tried to kill your [INTERVIEWED]. We coordinate. We are allies, and we coordinate nor do we talk about sensitive antiterror operations. Of course, [GPE] mourns the loss of innocent life. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], in your speech, you also you spoke about importance of prosperity, and you talked about offering business industry in [GPE]. Do you have anything specific in mind, such as [GPE] has been trying for some time to get an FTA? [INTERVIEWED]. First step is a BIT, and we will discuss that we will continue to discuss that. We discussed that during the Prime Minister's trip, and we will continue to pursue this avenue toward opening up additional opportunities, commercial opportunities between our respective countries. First things first, however there have been some preliminary discussions, as well, about perhaps some trading arrangements in the Western Provinces of [GPE]. These are preliminary discussions. We think it makes sense to have a discussion. Such an agreement, if a commercial arrangement, investment arrangement would be beneficial not only to [GPE] but to [GPE] as well. And so there is a variety of discussions we are having to continue to open up ways to encourage investment and commerce. I must I applaud the [INTERVIEWED]'s economic reform package. It is yielded some strong results. [GPE]'s economy is growing, and that is positive. You know, one of the key things is that people see the benefits of democracy the tangible benefits of democracy, besides being able to express themselves. [DATE] I also referred to the [GPE] press, you might recall. I think I referred to you as lively, meaning that at least the [GPE] press I have been exposed to has never been afraid to ask any questions, or never been intimidated, particularly with the open press conference. And I suspect it might be the same when I go [DATE]. So I want to talk about reconstruction aid right quick before you finish. It is very important for the people of [GPE] to and this is where trade matters as well, and commerce matters as well, that they see that [GPE] is interested in the lives of the citizens. You know, sometimes in the way things get reported, our policies get disconnected from people's lives improving. And we want that to happen, because a prosperous [GPE] is will be a great example, a country that believes in markets and educating people to fill the jobs of [DATE], and a country that continues to deal with rules and regulations that make investment difficult at times, will show what is possible. And that is important. When the disaster struck, it took our Government no time to move. And we moved a lot of equipment and a lot of manpower and a lot of aid, because we cared about the people that were suffering. I remember [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] calling me on the phone at [CARDINAL] point to thank me. And it was a genuine thanks, because we were as you know, we transferred a lot choppers, which were necessary to be able to move manpower and aid into remote regions of your country. He also asked, would we make sure that beyond the recovery effort, that there was a commitment to help rebuild. And my answer was, yes. And the reason it is important for your readers to understand, I said, yes, because this country cares about the families whose lives were turned upside down by this disaster. When we heard [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people lost their life, it touched our hearts and our conscience. When we realized [CARDINAL] people lost their homes, we cared about those who had been displaced. And so our commitment is to the people of [GPE], and it is a genuine, real, tangible commitment that the people of the country can see. I understand there is politics, and there is there is people expressing their opinions. But [CARDINAL] thing they cannot argue with those who want to be critical of [GPE] cannot argue with a genuine, heartfelt commitment to the improvement of the lives of those folks in [GPE] who suffered a suffered mightily as a result of the natural disaster. [INTERVIEWER] Yes, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], being an ally, there are some expectations. We captured the top lot of [ORG], and [CARDINAL] [NORP] soldiers died. There is a lot of expectation in [GPE] you spoke about bilateral investment treaty and stuff, access to the market more on access to the market. Are we moving towards free trade? And secondly, [NORP] students, sir, having terrible problems getting visas to the [GPE] And that is very important folks not getting to the [GPE] for education, and can you help us? [INTERVIEWED]. A couple of points [CARDINAL], there is no question that [ORG] is committed to working to get [PERSON] brought to justice. It was [PERSON] that tried to kill him [CARDINAL] time. And he also recognizes [ORG] presence is destabilizing. [ORG] does not care about the people of [GPE]. They do not care about helping people get a good education, realize the vast potential of [GPE]. They are there to create chaos and murder. And so I appreciate that, and I appreciate his firm resolve. Secondly, we have been there is a tangible benefit for the Government and the security of [GPE] in dealing with using sharing with, providing equipment. We resolved a long-simmering issue in the F-16s. I recognize it has been put on hold, but the Government's commitment is a real commitment. It changed policy, as you recall. It reversed something that took place in the past. The [ORG] is a beginning of it is a step toward what you talked about, advancing additional trading. I agree with you on the issue of education. First of all, there are a lot of [GPE] citizens here, and a lot of [NORP] that are making vital contributions to our country, proud [GPE] citizens who honor their heritage. I agree with you that there ought to be more student exchanges. But this is not an issue just for [NORP] students; this is an issue for students from other parts of the world as well. We had a very restrictive visa policy right after 9/11. It was a our visa policy was a natural reaction to a terrible event that took place. But by it did not take me long to realize that we were missing a great opportunity to have students from [GPE] see the real [GPE]. And there is no better place, no better way in many ways to see [GPE] than to come as a student, study at our institutions, but more importantly, interface with people the same age and realize that ours is an accepting culture. [INTERVIEWER] Absolutely. [INTERVIEWED]. And we welcome [NORP]. And we welcome people that may be different, and that there is no better ambassador for the [NORP] way of life and the attitudes the true attitudes of the [NORP] citizens than to have somebody here who has seen firsthand what [GPE] is like and then go back home. Word of mouth is a pretty significant antidote to some of the propaganda that is being played out for others to hear. And so I agree with you, and we are [PERSON] is very much involved with constantly revisiting the visa issue student visa issue, in particular, and not only encouraging students to come here, but once they are here, not making it difficult for them to complete their education. In other words, there are some restrictions even after the students got here. Finally, we are also along these lines announced a very strong language initiative so that more people are capable of will be capable of conversing with people in parts of the world where, frankly, we have not had that much conversation in their native language all aimed at creating a hospitable world. And this trip will help send a message to the people of [GPE]: [CARDINAL], we are proud of the [NORP] who live here; [CARDINAL], we want this relation to continue on. It is a vital relationship. And as I say, I am pleased with my personal relationship with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I try to put myself in his shoes. He is he is got a tough assignment. On the [CARDINAL] hand, he is got people trying to kill him, and on the other hand, he is taking this country toward further down the road of democracy, and in so doing, is dealing with as we speak, dealing with people who are taking advantage of a free press. And as I mentioned to you, I understand why people are reacting to that. It is very important, however, that they react in a way that does honor to the process and not resort to violence and destruction and, in some countries, to death. And so looking forward to it. See you all there, I hope. [INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to [GPE] [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], [CARDINAL] last [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER] About the visit, can you state if you ever think of canceling the visit [INTERVIEWED]. No, I am not going to never thought about canceling it. [INTERVIEWER] No? [INTERVIEWED]. Of course not. [INTERVIEWER] Because [INTERVIEWED]. No, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] chance. [INTERVIEWER] So we are a good word for the students, they may get visas? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we are working it very hard to make sure. Obviously, Ambassador [PERSON] and the [ORG] there is the conscience. I will pass this on to [PERSON] when I talk to her just to make sure that she is she is constantly calibrating and looking at the issue. We hear believe we have had a lot of there are a lot of folks here that in [GPE], and a lot of [ORG] around the world hear from respective governments when there is backlogs and slowness. These voices that are concerned about whether or not there is access to our universities are heard loud and clear. Believe me, it is [INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], best antidote is exposing people to [NORP] people. [INTERVIEWED]. There you go. [INTERVIEWER] That is the best antidote you have. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you. [INTERVIEWER] Do not restrict that. [INTERVIEWED]. Do not worry. Glad you are here. Good job.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpakistantelevision", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., you are paying a visit to [GPE] at a very crucial juncture, at a time when changes are being experienced in the region. And people of [GPE] are pinning a lot of hope on your visit because they think many problems are there and your visit will play a very vital role in it. So what is your vision for making this trip more meaningful and productive? [INTERVIEWED].. The first thing that is really important for people to understand is that relations between our countries oftentimes depend on the relations between the leaders. In other words, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and I can set a tone for the relationship because of our capacity to talk to each other. And it is important to be with each other and to share concerns and to talk about ideas. And so [CARDINAL] object of the trip is to continue what is a good relationship. A good relationship between me and [INTERVIEWED]. tends to permeate throughout our Government. Secondly, I and [CARDINAL] reason we have got a good relationship is we speak frankly with each other. Listen, I understand he has got a difficult job made really difficult by the fact that people have tried to kill him, as you know. Extremists have decided that he is a obstacle to their vision and, therefore, have tried to kill him. And so he is not only a man who is shown great courage in the face of adversity, but he does have a vision of how to work together to achieve common objectives. Secondly, I want the people of [GPE] to know that the [NORP] people care about them, that ours is a relationship that is much bigger than just the war on terror; that when our Chinooks flew supplies into the rural part of [GPE], it was not out of a sense of just, kind of, pure diplomacy, it was out of a sense of care and concern about the individuals. And I understand sometimes people may have wonder about our motives, wonder about [GPE]'s true concerns. And this will give me a chance to speak to the people of [GPE] and say, Look, we care for you, and remind people that in our country, there is great [NORP]. We are a rich society because we have got people from around the world, including people who were born and raised in [GPE] and have now chosen [GPE] as a home. And so it is a trip that is of good will and importance. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., there is a common perception that the relations between [GPE] and [GPE] have fluctuated in the past. So what measures would you suggest to make it more durable and sustainable for [DATE] to come and the long-time perspective? [INTERVIEWED].. Yes, that is a really good question, because, again, we want people to understand this relationship is a vital relationship that will exist throughout [DATE]. [CARDINAL] way we can do that is increase trade opportunities before our countries between our countries. And we will be talking about a bilateral investment treaty. Secondly, student exchanges and I understand there is been some issues with visas, and we have got to work through those, because I believe the more [NORP] youngsters who come to [GPE] to study will get to really see what [GPE] is all about. And as more [NORP] that go there to study will see what [GPE] is all about. And so there is ways for us, beyond the war on terror and by the way, the war on terror is a critical aspect of our relationship; do not get me wrong. But the other thing that is interesting and I think important for the people of [GPE] to know is that [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], in his democracy initiative, can show the whole [NORP] world, and the world itself, that it is possible to have a religious that is not extreme and a state that listens to people and responds to the needs of people. And that is a really important message that [GPE] can show the world. And I will, of course, continue to talk to my buddy and my friend about his goals for a democratic [GPE]. Kashmir [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., an early solution to the whole issue of Kashmir, about which you have also mentioned in your speech at [ORG] that is vital for the region. So, in your view, being a close friend of both [GPE] and [GPE], what role [GPE] can play in resolving this issue? [INTERVIEWED].. Well, I started to play a role in my speech, and I spoke out on the issue and encouraged [INTERVIEWED]. and the Prime Minister of [GPE] to continue down the road of solving the issue with a solution that is acceptable to all sides. And that is very important. There is a temptation sometimes for countries to try to jump in the middle of dialog. I believe a lasting solution can be achieved. I have seen the progress that is been made in the relationship from when I first became [INTERVIEWED]. You might remember an early time in my Presidency, there was real tension. And now, all of a sudden, there is some very encouraging signs transportation exchanges not transportation exchanges new transportation opportunities, trade. In just my discussions with both [INTERVIEWED]. and the Prime Minister, there appears to be a different attitude. And part of it has to do with trust, but there is got to be tangible progress; I recognize that. And so I will use my trip to urge the leadership to continue solving this issue, with the idea that it can be solved. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., what economic incentive would you offer to [GPE] during the forthcoming visit? [INTERVIEWED].. Well, trade is very important. And one of the steps on a robust trading relationship is what is called the Bilateral Investment Treaty, and that is an important part of the process. And believe me, every time [INTERVIEWED]. talks to me, he is talking about markets, and I understand that. But he also understands that there is some steps needed before this robust trade. I must applaud [INTERVIEWED].'s vision for the [GPE] economy. And in our world, politics, there is a lot of talk and a lot of, kind of, big noise. But the truth of the matter is, what matters is results. And [GPE]'s economy is strong, and that is good news. That is really good news for the people of [GPE]. First and foremost, because, obviously, if people can make a living and do well, they can see the benefits of democracy tangible benefits of living in a system where people are free to express themselves, but where the marketplace is the economic determinant. [INTERVIEWER]. Coming to another subject, what strategy [GPE] has adopted for conquering terrorism in [GPE], in a very holistic manner? [INTERVIEWED].. First of all, freedom defeats an ideology of hatred. And the enemy I say the enemy because they will kill they innocent [NORP]; they kill innocent [NORP]. We need more [NORP] have died at the hands of [ORG] and these extremists than anybody else. These I do not view these people as religious people. I view them as people who have taken a great religion and kind of twisted it to meet their means. And so they have a vision. And it is not a vision it is a vision that does not recognize the freedom of people to worship. It is a vision that does not understand the that recognize the importance of women in society or free speech. And so the way to defeat that vision is with a better vision, more hopeful, and democracy provides that vision. We are in close coordination, of course, with [ORG]. We share a mutual interest. Nobody should want foreign fighters in their soil wreaking havoc. And it is hard for a part of a country to develop if there are people in that part of the country that are willing to kill innocent life to achieve an objective. And so we share short-term objectives with [ORG]. We also share the long-term objective, and that is that is freedom. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED].. [INTERVIEWED].. I am looking forward to the trip. And I really appreciate you coming. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. I am grateful and honored. [INTERVIEWED].. Thank you, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithparichehrfarzamradiofarda", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much for your time in this interview with [ORG]. On [DATE] Nowruz, the Persian New Year, what message do you wish to share with the people of [GPE], especially with the [NORP] women, as well as the young generation? [INTERVIEWED]. First, that [GPE] wishes everybody a happy New Year. Secondly, that [GPE] people of [GPE] respects the great [NORP] history and culture. We have great respect for the people. And we have got problems with the Government. We have problems with the Government because the Government has been threatening, has made decisions that and statements that really have isolated the people of [GPE]. My message to the young in [GPE] is that someday your society will be free, and it will be a blessed time for you. My message to the women of [GPE] is that the women of [GPE] share your deep desire for children to be to grow up in a hopeful society and to live in peace. [GPE]/Freedom Agenda [INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of women of [GPE], [INTERVIEWED], the majority of population in [GPE] are women. And even in the [NORP] culture they are considered the foundation on which men deeply rely. Is there any plan or could there be one to promote and engage the [NORP] women in the [GPE] to a unified and centralized movement for a free and democratic [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the people of [GPE] are going to have to come to the conclusion that a free country is in their interest. We, of course, support freedom movements all around the world. We are supporting a freedom movement on the [NORP] border in [GPE]. We are promoting and helping the [NORP] develop a free society. By the way, a free [GPE] will help the [NORP] see the blessings of a free society. There is no doubt in my mind that the women will be leading freedom movements in [GPE] and elsewhere. And the role of [GPE] is to provide, you know, moral support without and other support without undermining their cause. [GPE]/Iran [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], in this fifth anniversary of the Iraq war, what impact do you think a peaceful solution on the [NORP] nuclear crisis and a normalization of our relations with [GPE] would have on the security and political situation in [GPE] and more generally in the whole Middle East? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that success in [GPE] will first of all depend upon the [NORP]' desire to reconcile their differences and to live in peace, and that is happening. It is hard work to overcome the a dictatorship like [PERSON], but nevertheless, most [NORP] want to live in peace with their neighbor. Secondly, a peaceful [GPE] will depend upon making it clear to the [NORP] to stop exporting weapons from [GPE] into [GPE] that arm militias and arm criminal gangs that cause there to be harm for the innocent people. Thirdly, it is very important for the neighborhood to understand that [GPE] is committed to peace and that we are not that we will not be run out because of violence; that we believe that we are there for the right reason, which is to promote freedom and peace. The free you know, there is a chance that the [GPE] and [GPE] can reconcile their differences, but the Government is going to have to make some make different choices. And one is to verifiably suspend the enrichment of uranium, at which time there is a way forward. And the [NORP] people have got to understand that [GPE] is going to be firm in our desire to prevent the nation from developing a nuclear weapon, but reasonable in our desire to see to it that you have civilian nuclear power without you know, without enabling the Government to enrich. And the problem is, is that they have not told the truth in the past. And therefore, it is very difficult for [GPE] and the rest of the world or much of the rest of the world to trust [ORG] when it comes to telling the truth. And so I support the [NORP] proposal to provide [GPE] with enriched uranium to go into a civilian nuclear power plant. There is a way forward. In other words, I do not know what the [NORP] people believe about [GPE], but they must believe that we have proposed a way forward that will yield to peace. And it is their Government that is resisting these changes. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you and your allies launched a global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism, what do you think is your most important challenge to expose and stop the secretive ambition of [GPE]'s Government to enrich uranium, while assuring its citizens that their happiness and prosperity and peace is a benefit within their reach? [INTERVIEWED]. Sure, absolutely. Well, [CARDINAL] thing is, is to reiterate my belief that the [NORP] should have a civilian nuclear power program. It is in their right to have it. The problem is the Government cannot be trusted to enrich uranium because, [CARDINAL], they have hidden programs in the past, and they may be hiding one now, who knows; and secondly, they have declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people some in the Middle East. And that is unacceptable to [GPE], and it is unacceptable to the world. But what is acceptable to me is to work with a nation like [GPE] to provide the fuel so that the plan can go forward, and which therefore makes it you know, it shows that [ORG] does not need to learn to enrich. My only point to the [NORP] people is we want you to be able to realize your sovereign rights. The Government has been duplicitous to the world. Very few people trust your Government. And if the Government changes its behavior, there is a better way forward for the [NORP] people. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED], world democracy is everyone's rightful way of life. In [GPE], on the other hand, there is no respect for the basic rights of [NORP] citizen; there is no rule of law; and there is no, certainly, the freedom of speech. Do you believe that the people of [GPE] stand a chance against this regime, to bring about the positive change in anytime soon with your support? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would like very much for the [NORP] people to realize a society based upon rule of law and free speech and free worship of religion. There is nothing I'd like to see more than a society in which young girls can grow up to realize their dreams with a good education system. You know, this is a this regime, however, is one that sometimes when people express themselves in an open way, there can be serious punishment. This is a regime that says they have elections, but they get to decide who is on the ballot, which is not a free and fair election. So this is a regime and a society that is got a long way to go. But the people of [GPE] can be rest assured [GPE], whether I am [INTERVIEWED] or the next [INTERVIEWED], will strongly support their desires to live in a free society. [INTERVIEWER]. May I have, [INTERVIEWED], my last question? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. You said many times that the [GPE] missile defense system in [GPE] and [GPE] is to defend [GPE] and its [NORP] allies from attack by rogue states such as [GPE]. But some this argument is still between [GPE] and [GPE]. Are you optimistic to solve the problem? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is interesting you ask that question. We intend to move forward with the and [GPE] and [GPE], for the good of [ORG]. Obviously, it'd be make life easier if the [NORP] and [GPE] cooperated in such a missile defense. [PERSON] and [PERSON] Secretary [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON] were in [GPE] [DATE] talking about the very subject, as to whether or not we can find grounds to cooperate. The missile systems, defense systems, would not be aimed at [GPE]; they'd be aimed at nations that would, you know, try to hold the free world hostage with a nuclear weapon. And so it is I am optimistic. I am cautiously optimistic. I do not know whether we can find common ground. But we are trying to find common ground, and that is what is that is the first step, is to make the attempt. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you so much, [INTERVIEWED], for your time. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, ma'am, thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpatrobertsonthechristianbroadcastingnetwork", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. The 40th [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. When historians write about the [PERSON] administration, what do you want them to say? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, I have been asked that, and I guess I have to say, I have never thought that far ahead. I am so busy thinking about what we want to accomplish. I guess maybe just that I helped perpetuate this great [NORP] dream. Administration Goals [INTERVIEWER]. What do you hope for in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. There are so many things. I would like to get us definitely on the pattern of reducing the deficit so that the balanced budget is in view. I would like to have, then, going into effect at that time a balanced budget amendment so we could never again go [DATE], as we have, of regularly deficit spending [DATE]. And I would like to see us also have some plan for beginning installments to start reducing the national debt, as we have done many times in the past. There are a number of things that I would like to see-resolve the problem of prayer in schools and have us on the road, a good solid road that could make us optimistic about the chances for peace. Budget Deficit and Tax Reform [INTERVIEWER]. On the budget deficit, it seems as if members of your own party are not totally in accord with you. The [ORG] has not supported you. Are you optimistic? [PERSON] said maybe this is the last chance, but you are optimistic about the future? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am. There is no way that anyone could ever balance the budget in [DATE]. This budget, over [DATE], has been structurally built into our budgeting process. And the difficulty, of course, is getting agreement not on the need to reduce it-everyone seems to agree on that-but then trying to get them to agree on, well, where do you apply the tourniquet and shut off that hemorrhage of funds. But I think that we are on the beginning of a track where we can see a progression of reducing the deficit as a percentage of gross national product. You know, if you just count the deficit in dollars-and it looks so horrifying-and you say, How did this ever happen? Well, if you look at it back over [DATE] of deficit spending on the basis of what it is as a percentage of gross national product, that, too, has been growing bigger. So, it is not as far out of line with past deficits; some of them were just about as big as this one is in that percentage. But if we can get on a percentage to where, for [DATE]-what we have in mind is if we can get it [DATE] down to [PERCENT] of the gross national product, [PERCENT] [DATE], [PERCENT] [DATE], we think that that progression will point us to, by [DATE], a balanced budget and then you could have go into effect the balanced budget amendment. [INTERVIEWER]. I spoke to an influential [NORP] Senator on [DATE] who felt that, possibly, the tax reform measure might be diverting attention away from deficit reduction. Do you see that as a complement to it or possibly a stimulant for it? [INTERVIEWED]. Actually, a stimulant for it in a way, because if you look back, not just in our administration and what we did in [DATE] when we implemented-or began implementing our tax cuts, but go back to [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]'s across-the-board tax cut, before that to [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and the tax cuts that he implemented-in every instance the economic growth has resulted in the Government getting more revenues at the lower rates than it was getting at the higher rates. So, I think this tax reform very definitely would help. It is not aimed at being a part of that, but it would help in that it would stimulate economic growth and I think would actually, thus, result in increased revenues. [INTERVIEWER]. This has been spoken of as a profamily tax measure. How will that help the families in your estimate? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let us start right off with someone down there at the lower end of the earning scale. [CARDINAL] of the features of this is that the personal exemption is increased to $[MONEY], 000 and then the deduction for dependents is almost doubled to $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] apiece instead of the present [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. So, you take a family of [CARDINAL], you have got $8, 000 of nontaxable income to begin with right there. And that plus the reduced rates-we believe that-and first of all, so many of our people cannot and do not take advantage of many of the loopholes that others have been able to use to reduce their fair share of the tax burden. So, it is very definitely aimed at families and that was sort of proven [DATE] when the [NORP] majority in [ORG]-so, I am not just citing a [NORP] measure-in [ORG] have made a study of this tax proposal plus all the others that are before the [ORG] and said flatly this one is the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. [INTERVIEWER]. Is the [MONEY] 000 personal exemption, dependent's exemption, is that a non-negotiable feature? Would you veto a bill if it did not have that in it? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it just has to have it, and let me give you my thinking on that. [DATE], as you know, that deduction was $[MONEY] and then inflation took hold and has kept coming on. And finally, someone got around to increasing the [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. But right now, actually, if we had kept up with inflation, the deduction should be [MONEY]. Now, we could not remain revenue neutral and go that high, but going to $[MONEY], 000 is eminently justified simply on the matter of-that actually, in purchasing power, that is smaller than the $[MONEY] was back in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. There is no lobby for it, though; among the people, the vast numbers will help. So would you, in a sense, be their champion and go the mount on that issue? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, and I have to say, though, that I have not heard here, from [NORP] or [NORP], any objection to those figures. There have been some of the loopholes or deductions, other areas that people have thought should be retained, and there is been argument about that. But I have not heard anyone raise a complaint about these personal exemptions. Administration Accomplishments [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] oblique question. I read that the reason that you and [PERSON] were so tremendously popular is because you gave the [NORP] people hope. Looking down the road, what cause do you have for hope? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am an eternal optimist, I know; but I cannot help but have hope. [DATE], we were seeing our streets torn up with rioting and demonstrations of various kinds, but we also were seeing a lack of hope. We were hearing talk that we were no longer a nation of growth and so forth; that we must begin to limit ourselves in our expectations, and our government itself was telling that to the people. And here, [DATE], in [DATE], double-digit inflation is down to [PERCENT] 4 percent and still on its way down; interest rates, the prime rate had reached [PERCENT], and it is down to far less than a [CARDINAL] of that now, and still, I believe, they are going down. In [DATE], we have created [CARDINAL] new jobs. And [DATE]-you know what is referred to as the employment pool is everyone in [GPE]-male and female [DATE] are known as the potential labor pool-that if all of them sought work-they are all employable. The highest percentage of that labor pool is employed now than has ever been employed before in our history. And the growth in the recovery has been the greatest that we have known in any recovery from any previous recession or depression. But even more than that, there is something out there-you get out on the road and talk to the people. There is a spirit. Our young people, who once were, as you know, totally disillusioned with government and so forth over the Vietnam war-the resurgence of patriotism among them. And now with our volunteer military-no longer having to have a draft-I do not know of anything I am more proud of than our young men and women in uniform and their spirit. [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. I ask you a question for the women viewers in our audience. You have just gone through a very critical medical problem, and we know how close you and your wife [PERSON] are. It is almost a fabled love affair-better than [GPE] could do it. What was her reaction? How did she handle this crisis? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, she is very courageous, and once upon a time when she was younger she was one of those-what did they call them-those nurses aides that-during war time and all. So, that part, she was on the Job. But she also is a very great worrier, and let me put it this way: I have recovered quicker than she did. [INTERVIEWER]. It was a terrible crisis. This is the second one. Some of your very close friends from [GPE] have gone back into private enterprise or gone back home. Are you turning more to your wife for counsel? She is a very wise lady. [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, listen, we have always talked over everything together. I could not imagine it being otherwise. But as to the people leaving the administration, I have expected that. I had [DATE] experience in [GPE]. And I made it plain from the beginning that these people-I would take them even if it was only for [DATE] or [DATE] and then find someone else if and when they had to return to their own careers. And I think it should be that way if you are going to get-well, I always put it this way. I wanted people in government that really did not want a job in government, but that were willing to come and serve rather than those that were seeking government jobs. And the result is, you know that they will have to go back to their own careers sooner or later. But, no, [PERSON] and I-we do not have any secrets from each other. [NORP] Hostages in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. We were very heartened to learn that Reverend [PERSON] had been released from [GPE], and word reached us that a member of the [ORG] staff was dispatched on [DATE], I believe, to [GPE] to seek the release of the remaining [CARDINAL]-and actually it was [CARDINAL] at that time. Is there any word on that that might give hope to us? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I cannot really talk about what we are doing, because I do not want to do anything that will endanger the prospects of the others being freed. I can only say that we have explored every avenue. We have been working for this for all the time since the first [CARDINAL], Mr. [PERSON], was kidnaped. And I know that some of the families have grown impatient, because if they do not see things in the paper, they do not think we are doing anything. But going public and being in the paper is not the way to get a Reverend [PERSON] back or any of the others. [INTERVIEWER]. Could we say cautiously optimistic, or is there anything that we can say to characterize it? [INTERVIEWED]. I have to remain cautiously optimistic. And we are continuing the efforts that-and we have explored and been trying in every avenue that is open to us. But, again, it is something I cannot talk about because, as I say, there is a risk in all of this for them. [NORP] [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. You are getting ready for the summit. Is the [NORP] press-and a free press is so important in our nation but is it from time to time being manipulated by [GPE] to sort of stack the deck against you in this summit meeting? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I did begin to feel there for a while that when the summit started they'd be rooting for the other side; that he was wearing the white hat, and I was wearing the black hat. You know, that is an old [GPE] expression, that you identify the villain as- [INTERVIEWER]. I know. [INTERVIEWED]. -by the color of the hat. I think what should be better understood by our people-and this is not any criticism of our press-[GPE] has a worldwide disinformation network, and it is very effective. And they can get many things published and broadcast and so forth to suit their ends and in their drives, for example, to try to create some friction among us and our allies. And I do not think we have anything comparable to that. Free and Fair Trade [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] last question. I see that our time has run out. If the [ORG] gives you a trade protectionist bill having either a tariff or a surcharge or some other name, will you veto it? [INTERVIEWED]. I will have to. That is one of the advantages of being my age. I was looking for work in the Great Depression, and I know what the Smoot-Hawley bill did, the world trade war that it created. There is no way that that can win-protectionism for, say, a particular industry-no one ever looks over their shoulder to see how many people in other industries lost their jobs-because it is a [CARDINAL]-way street, and retaliation sets in. We are still the greatest exporter in the world. And even though there is a great trade imbalance right now, that we are importing far more than we are exporting, that is not because we have reduced our exports, as big as they ever were. We have increased our imports because of the value of our dollar and the fact that our trading partners have not had the economic recovery we have had, so their prices are low. And you cannot blame people for picking up a bargain. [INTERVIEWER]. What they need is a dose of [PERSON] in Europe, is that what you say? [INTERVIEWED]. Exactly. As a matter of fact, they themselves admit that in their systems there are so many rigidities in labor laws and everything else that have been built in that they have not had the recovery. Indeed, when I was at the recent economic summit, the last summit in [DATE], they called to my face, they called what we have is the miracle of [GPE]. So, we have tried to pass on to them information that we think would help them have some miracles. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much. This has been wonderful. [INTERVIEWED]. Well- [INTERVIEWER]. God bless you. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you very much, and, in saying that, let me tell you, when you asked about the future and why I was optimistic and all, I am convinced this is a nation under God and as long as we recognize that, believe that, I think he will help us. [INTERVIEWER]. There is no question about it. That is the greatest cause for optimism I know of. Thank you very much, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpauldukeandmartinagronskythepublicbroadcastingservice", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [1.] [INTERVIEWED], we are delighted to join you here [DATE] in the [FAC] on the third floor of [FAC], a charming and homey room. As you now round out [DATE] in [FAC], do you feel at home here? Do you find that you enjoy the splendid misery of the Presidency, to use those famous words of [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I think my family as well as myself enjoy living here. It is a magnificent home, of course. It can get a little lonely at times. It is big, but there are so many wonderful things here that you can enjoy. It is a super place to live. It also gives you an opportunity to focus in on the problems, and it is the problems that come with the house that make it somewhat difficult at times to really relax and enjoy yourself. [INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of those problems, [INTERVIEWED], I think many people regarded you as something of an interim [INTERVIEWED] when you first assumed office. Do you feel now that [DATE], that you have established a [PERSON] Presidency? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we have gradually put together a domestic program and a foreign policy that can be identified as [ORG]. As we move in [DATE], I think it will become more and more evident, which, of course, gives us an opportunity in the next election to lay that record out so the public can judge it against any alternative programs submitted by the opposition. I do not think there will be any problem in identifying what we have done, what we have tried to do, and it will be known as a [ORG] policy or a [ORG] program, so to speak. MR. [PERSON]. Let us look back at [DATE] in the terms that you give, [INTERVIEWED]. What would you pick out as the things you have done in [DATE] that make it indeed a [PERSON] Presidency, both in domestic and foreign policy? [INTERVIEWED]. Before getting into foreign and domestic policy, [PERSON], I think it is entirely proper to say that I have tried to restore public confidence in the Government and, particularly, in the [ORG], in the executive branch, in [ORG]. I do not mean to criticize anybody else, but all the polls showed that [DATE] there had been a great loss of confidence on the part of the [NORP] people in their Government. We, the new [ORG], with our appointments, with our openness, with our attempt to be frank and honest with the [NORP] people, I think we have turned the corner, and there is a restored confidence on behalf of the [NORP] people in their Government. Now, let us turn to the policy areas. We inherited a very difficult economic situation. The rate of inflation was somewhere [PERCENT], the highest in [DATE]. That was our immediate economic problem, and we undertook some activities both fiscally and in a monetary sense to correct the situation. I am glad to report that it is now somewhere [PERCENT] per annum. That is too high, and we had a little setback the last announcement on the CPI, the Consumer Price Index. MR. [PERSON]. In fact, it indicates it is going to go up [PERCENT] if it continues at this rate. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think--that is the new wholesale price figure that came out [TIME]. But if you annualize [DATE] of the Wholesale Price Index, it shows it is [CARDINAL], because we had [DATE] of, as I recall, negative increases in the Wholesale Price Index. So, I think you have to look at it in the broad span. We have made significant progress in the field of inflation, and we are going to continue to do so. It is important. Then, of course, we were faced in [DATE] with a precipitous drop in employment and a tremendous increase in unemployment. We adjusted our economic policies to meet that problem without sacrificing our effort against inflation. We did have an increase of unemployment [PERCENT] [PERCENT]--much, much too high--but [DATE] the unemployment figure has gone down from [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL], and the most encouraging part is the fact that we have had an increase in employment of [CARDINAL], 000, as I recall the figure. That is the encouraging thing. We are putting people back to work even though the unemployment figure is still too high. Now, this is a very narrow line to follow of still .trying to control inflation and at the same time reduce unemployment. I can just assure you we are going to follow a steady, firm, I think, correct policy to meet these [CARDINAL] challenges. THE NATION'S ECONOMY [2.] [INTERVIEWER]. When you referred to a correct policy, [INTERVIEWED], I would like to remind you that it seems to us that in [DATE] we have had an awakening, new concern that inflation may take off again, that unemployment is going to remain quite high through [DATE]. So, do you plan any new measures to deal with the economy? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we have to make certain that the policies we have undertaken are continued. Now those policies are what? If we were to go along with the [ORG] that wants to spend a great deal more money--I drew the line at a deficit of [MONEY]--the [NORP] figures are up to [MONEY] or [MONEY] deficit for [DATE]--if we were to go along with that kind of a deficit figure that the [ORG] proposes, I think we would be in serious trouble on the reigniting of inflation. So, we are still going to veto bills that accelerate expenditures in [ORG] beyond a reasonable figure. On the other hand, with the restoration of public confidence by our, I think, responsible action, I believe that we are going to regenerate industrial activity, which means more jobs. Now, let me take [CARDINAL] aspect of [DATE]. We have had the most rapid inventory sell-off in the history of [GPE]. It is almost unbelievable. The net result is that current inventories in many, many areas of the country, in industries in the country, are down. So, they have to come up with additional production to meet current [DATE] demand. With consumer confidence coming back the way it has--and all the pollsters show that--I think our steady, firm, responsible course is going to meet the challenge of inflation and unemployment. They will not be as good as we would like--I am very honest and very frank about it--but we will be moving in the right direction. MR. [PERSON]. Let us take the direction in which we are moving, which we are in [DATE], leaving percentages aside. We have got better than [CARDINAL] [NORP] who do not have jobs. We reckon now that there are something like [CARDINAL] Americans--12 percent of the population of this country--that are at the poverty level or below. And many of your critics make the point that while you are a good man and a decent man, you do not show a sufficient amount of compassion, in their opinion, for the people who are unfortunate in that sense, for the people who are on welfare and people who live on food stamps. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], our welfare program is very generous. Our food stamp program is very generous. A good many [NORP] think that there are too many abuses both in welfare and food stamps, and I think there are too many abuses. If we could correct the abuses, we could be more compassionate to the people who have a real need for both welfare and/or food stamps or both. Now, you know, inflation, [PERSON], hits the unemployed even more drastically than it hurts the people who are employed, so my compassion is across the spectrum. It is not just aimed at the people who are employed. We want to control inflation to help all [NORP], including the unemployed. If we do not control inflation, the ones who are hurt the most are the people who are unemployed and the people on fixed incomes. MR. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], no one would argue that inflation is not a threat, but the concern is that you seem to be more worried, really, constantly--and it is a conscious decision on the part of your [ORG]--with inflation than you have been with unemployment. And generally the whole thrust-- [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I must respectfully disagree with you. This [ORG] has extended the unemployment compensation program to, I think, [DATE]. We have broadened the eligibility of unemployment beyond what it ever was in [GPE]. We have paid more money out in unemployment benefits than any administration has ever done. So, we have shown in dollars and in programs a deep concern for the unemployed. We have gone along with a public service employment program up to the maximum authorized by the [ORG]. MR. [PERSON]. But yet you have also vetoed an effort for a job bill that was passed by the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], that was, I think, a poor label for a bad piece of legislation. The facts are, I sent up a request for [MONEY] for public service employment or a jobs bill that included [MONEY] for a [DATE] youth employment program and the remainder for the public service employment. That shows my interest in the youth who wanted employment [DATE], and it shows my interest in the people we could hire in the public service area. Now, what the [ORG] did was to take my recommendation and add [MONEY] in pork-barrel programs that would not have solved the problem of the people unemployed [DATE]. It was pure [NORP] politics of a pork-barrel kind, and that is the reason I vetoed it. And what happened? After I vetoed it, the [ORG] recognized they were wrong and they sent back a bill that included my public service employment, my [DATE] youth program, and added [MONEY] just to satisfy their ego. Now, the truth is we got a good program through and we did not get a pork-barrel program shoved down the [NORP] people. VIEWS ON THE PRESIDENCY [3.] [INTERVIEWER]. Let me take this to a somewhat different plane, [INTERVIEWED]. There are critics who suggest that you have not provided the kind of broad roadmap for the country's future which this [ORG] with its many problems desperately needs [DATE]. [PERSON], writing in [ORG] [DATE], suggested there remains a strain of doubt about your leadership. [PERSON], in [ORG], suggested that you may in reality be a provisional [INTERVIEWED]. Does it disturb you that you do not appear to have captured the hearts and minds of a great many [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. I read both of those articles, and they are very able columnists. I think we will, with the next State of the Union message, have some areas that will point the direction in the long run for our country. I instituted [DATE] what we call a no new program approach. Why did we do that? We had to solve our current problems first in order to get our fiscal situation under control. Once we have achieved that result--and I think we have made substantial headway--then we can take a look at and make recommendations for the long range that will meet some of the problems that are raised by [PERSON] and [PERSON], and by others. MR. [PERSON]. How do you deal with this perception that people have about the lack of leadership, and not only for you but for [ORG]? For example, Senator [PERSON] of [GPE], of your party, said [ORG] must come to stand for something and until it does that the word [NORP] will be associated with Watergate and big business, hard times. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I, of course, deny that this [ORG], [ORG], is in any way whatsoever connected with Watergate. [ORG] is going to be known, in my judgment, for a successful implementation of economic policy that will provide jobs in the private sector in the long run and in foreign policy will expand our efforts for peace throughout the world. That is what this [ORG] will stand for. I think those are good things for an administration to be remembered over [DATE]. MR. [PERSON]. If you achieve them. THE [INTERVIEWED] . I think the record is going to be good, and I think right now the public, if you look at the polls, is beginning to perceive that. The polls show that, on a personal basis, I am doing much better. It is not as high as I would like, but not many people in public life are doing very well in the polls. [INTERVIEWER]. But also, [INTERVIEWED], the polls show that [CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL] [NORP]-by [CARDINAL] pollster who happens to be from your home [GPE], [PERSON]-that [CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL] [NORP] [DATE] regard themselves as strict [NORP]. I think this relates additionally to the fact that rightly or wrongly, many Members of [ORG] and elsewhere, your critics, detect a negative quality about your leadership. And does not that do damage perhaps to your own Presidency and to [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me quote, if I might, some other statistics. Most polls that are taken [DATE] indicate that a majority of [NORP] are in the middle of the road or conservative. Now they do not label themselves as [NORP] or [NORP]. They are talking about a philosophy. And maybe labels [DATE] are not the right way to identify people's views, whether it is [NORP] or [NORP]. I believe the [NORP] people want a healthy economy, a firm and successful foreign policy. That is what we are going to give them, and that is what we are giving them at the present time. [INTERVIEWER]. When you talk about a healthy economy, [INTERVIEWED], there are other problems as well. What do we do about the rising cost of medical care, what do we do about the 12 percent of the population which [PERSON] referred to which is now at the poverty level in this country? What do we do about the enormous problems of the cities which seem to be accelerating? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let us take the last one first. I think the cities have to recognize that they have a responsibility in the fiscal area as well. [ORG] has done a substantial amount for cities through the general revenue sharing program, through a multitude of categorical grant programs. The cities have to realize that they have a fiscal management problem, too, and many of them have. Many of our cities are well managed; a few are not. [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE], for example? [INTERVIEWED]. I think the record speaks for itself. WELFARE REFORM [4.] [INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], in [CARDINAL] area, the welfare area, your outgoing [ORG] Secretary [PERSON] suggested [DATE] that we should now be giving thought to some kind of negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed annual income. Is that in the future as far as your Administration is concerned? [INTERVIEWED]. Sometime this fall, there will be conducted under our [ORG]--and the Vice [INTERVIEWED] is acting Chairman, Vice Chairman, but the actual acting Chairman of [ORG]--and he and his associates are going to conduct some public hearings around the country where a number of areas will be examined by that [ORG], where people in various communities will have an opportunity to testify, proponents of [CARDINAL] approach or another approach. It will not be an organized effort to direct them any way. Some people say we should modify the present welfare program. Some say we should junk it and come in with a new one. There are a number of other alternatives. What we are going to do through [ORG] is give people throughout the country, not just the [GPE] complex, an opportunity to express themselves, to tell us what they think is the answer to the welfare problem. There is an awful lot of wisdom out in the country on what is right and what is wrong about welfare, what we [DATE] ought to do about medical care and the costs and the program. And as a result of those hearings on a nationwide basis, we will formulate our recommendations in those areas that need change. [INTERVIEWER]. But the decision does have to be made here, [INTERVIEWED]. The decision has to be made ultimately in [FAC]. And what is your thinking? Is it your thinking that the welfare system in this country is now in such a chaotic mess that some new system must be devised, and it is likely that some form of guaranteed [DATE] income which was a concept that was put forward by [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. There is no doubt that the present welfare program either ought to be junked and a substitute put in its place or the present welfare program has to be tightened up very, very greatly. Now, you can get proponents on either side. When I was in [ORG], I voted twice for the program that was submitted by the previous administration, because I believed then and now that welfare reform was mandatory. Unfortunately, even though [ORG] passed that legislation twice, [ORG] refused or did not act on it. Now, it is my judgment that we will come out of these public hearings, we will come up with either some tightening of the existing welfare program or will offer a substitute, and there are a number of alternatives. I am not going to prejudge what the public is going to tell us. We want the public to be a participant in this process. WATERGATE [[CARDINAL].] MR. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], could we return to the question of confidence, which is a real concern. You have been [INTERVIEWED] for [DATE], and looking back, would you agree with the conventional wisdom, as far as Watergate is concerned, that the system worked? THE . I think the system did work, [PERSON]. It went through a very traumatic period, but if you look back through what happened before [DATE] and what has happened since, I think you must come to the conclusion that the system did work. MR. [PERSON]. And looking ahead beyond that, do you think that in [DATE] that you have been in office that safeguards have been put into effect that would ensure that we would not have another Watergate? Do you feel there is a sense in the country that you have achieved that? [INTERVIEWED]. Certainly what I have tried to do precludes a Watergate from happening under a [PERSON] Administration, and I believe through the press, through the public, through the [ORG], there would never be an opportunity for another Watergate to take place. MR. [PERSON]. Let me ask you to deal then with a rather remarkable and startling observation that was made to me by the Special Watergate Prosecutor, [PERSON], [DATE]. I asked Mr. [PERSON], if your predecessor had destroyed the Watergate tapes, would he be sitting [DATE] in [FAC], and he answered Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. I would not undercut any judgment by [PERSON]. He knew intimately the content of many of the tapes, and he had a special responsibility. So, if he made that judgment, I am certainly not going to contradict it. [ORG] [6.] MR. [PERSON]. Let us carry it, not only the judgment but its implications-and you know the famous observation of Congressman [PERSON], Next time will there be a watchman in [TIME]? What concerns everyone in the country is that after Watergate, we now have a crisis of confidence, in the [ORG], for example, a feeling that it is out of hand, that it is not sufficiently accountable. That has to be an enormous concern for you as [INTERVIEWED]. How do you feel about the revelations of [ORG]? How do you relate them to the crisis of confidence? [INTERVIEWED]. As a result of some of the revelations, I appointed [ORG]. That [ORG] conducted a very thorough investigation of the allegations concerning the [ORG]. That [ORG] has recommended to me certain administrative actions that I should take and some legislative proposals that I should submit to the [ORG]. My staff has taken the [ORG] recommendations and the [ORG] recommendations-and that [ORG] got into the [ORG] to some extent--and I intend to submit to the [ORG] specific proposals that I think will maintain the [ORG] and our total intelligence-gathering community so they can do the job which is essential for our national security on the [CARDINAL] hand and at the same time preclude our intelligence-gathering agencies from violating our constitutional rights as individuals. MR. [PERSON]. That is a point that I would like to raise with you. A man that you admire very much, [CARDINAL] of your late predecessors, [PERSON], in conversations with [PERSON] on his concept of the Presidency, remarked on the [ORG], and I quote Mr. [PERSON]: Now, those fellows in the [ORG] do not just report on wars and the like. They go out and make their own and there is nobody to keep track of what they are up to. They spend [MONEY] on stirring up trouble so they will have something to report on. They become a government all its own and all secret. They do not have to account to anybody. That is a very dangerous thing in a democratic society. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the recommendations that have come from [ORG] and from [ORG] and the result of the investigations in the [ORG] as well as the [ORG], I think, will give to the [ORG] and to the [INTERVIEWED] the tools to correct the abuses that Mr. [PERSON] spoke of in his conversations. MR. [PERSON]. And that you perceive? [INTERVIEWED]. And that I think have to be done in the future to eliminate any possibility of abuses such as Mr. [PERSON] mentioned. MR. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], the feeling is that perhaps you yourself as [INTERVIEWED], in terms of the record of the Presidency versus the [ORG], may not even be aware of many areas in which the [ORG] operates. [INTERVIEWED]. I can assure you, [PERSON], of [CARDINAL] things. [CARDINAL], as a Member of the [ORG] and a member of a committee that had some jurisdiction over the [ORG], but more specifically as [INTERVIEWED], I have probably gotten into the operations of the [ORG] and other related intelligence agencies in greater depth than any other [INTERVIEWED]. And as a consequence, the proposals that I will submit and the administrative actions that I will take will correct those alleged and actual abuses. I think I know more about the [ORG] than any other [INTERVIEWED], certainly since [DATE] or [DATE] when it was established, and either in the rules and regulations or the law or the personnel, we are going to make certain that the [ORG] does its job in the gathering of foreign intelligence and the analyzation of that intelligence for the benefit of the [INTERVIEWED], [ORG], and the Secretary of [ORG], and at the same time will not abuse the proper constitutional rights of [CARDINAL] [NORP]. We are going to do that. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], you served in [ORG] for a long time and [ORG] is the people's instrument that was really supposed to be protecting us against the excesses of the [ORG]. It is obvious now that [ORG] never did its job adequately. Did you ever have any inkling when you say you have been familiar with the [ORG] since [DATE]--did you ever have any inkling that these things were going on? [INTERVIEWED]. I must admit, [PERSON], that I was not familiar with some of the details that have been brought to light. I was among a very limited number of Members of [ORG], [ORG] and [ORG], [NORP] and [NORP], who analyzed the [ORG] budget and their overall programs. But I must admit that that kind of control by the [ORG], in retrospect, was not adequate. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel that members of the [ORG] lied to you as a Member of [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I do not think they lied to me. I will not pass judgment on what they said to others. But I do believe that the control of the [ORG] by the [ORG] over a period of [DATE] was not as sufficient as it should have been. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel this is now essential for the future, that [ORG] must exercise greater control over the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think there has to be some improvement in this area, but I am not passing judgment on this program as to the specific recommendations I will make. We are now analyzing various proposals, and what the [ORG] does, of course, is their decision. But I can make recommendations as to how we can tighten up the control and at the same time give to the [INTERVIEWED] and other people who have an interest the information on foreign intelligence which is so essential to our national security. You have to balance the [CARDINAL], and that is a very fine line. And I think we can do it. We are certainly going to try. [INTERVIEWER]. The Attorney General, Mr. [PERSON], in reading the material which you sent over from [ORG] which has not been released to the public about [ORG] activities, said he was appalled by some of the things he read. Were you appalled? [INTERVIEWED]. I think some of the things were improper, but I must say, [PERSON], people can judge what others have done and unfortunately sometimes do not put themselves in the position of a previous [INTERVIEWED] or put themselves in the position of a previous Secretary of [ORG]. I think we can recognize the areas of mistake, but I do not like to be a [DATE]-morning quarterback. I think we ought to deal with the facts and we ought to deal with what we should do in the future and learn from the past, and I think we can correct these things. MR. [PERSON]. What we learned from the past, even despite your dislike of being a [DATE]-morning quarterback, is that your predecessors accepted proposals which called for the assassination of a foreign chief of state, for [CARDINAL] thing, and brought about the overturn of a government in [GPE], for another thing. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I am not going to pass judgment on whether there was an order or was not an order about assassination. I have said categorically this is [DATE] that is past. I do not want to point a finger at any other [INTERVIEWED] or [INTERVIEWED]s. I have looked at all of the material. We have given the material to the [ORG] committee, and it is their obligation to, I think, analyze it but not do any finger-pointing. Now, the [ORG] has [CARDINAL] kinds of operations--[CARDINAL] covert and the other overt. Their covert operations, under the procedures we have under this [ORG], are carefully monitored--carefully monitored, and I can assure you that every one that is done is in the national interest of [GPE]. MR. [PERSON]. But your predecessors might well have thought the same thing. The concern is the use of the [ORG] covertly, if you like, as an instrument of policy and foreign policy by your predecessors. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I think we have to understand we live in a real world. Every nation, either a friend or an adversary, has a comparable intelligence-gathering, intelligence-operating organization in their government. And they do it for their own national security. Now, [GPE] has to compete in this real world. It is a tough world, and our national security on many occasions involves doing things in a covert way. I can only assure you that if and when we undertake them under this [ORG], they will be carefully monitored and they will be directly related to the national security of this country. I am not going to pass judgment on what other [INTERVIEWED]s did. They were good men, whether they were [NORP] or [NORP]. They thought they were doing right. I can only pass judgment on what I want us to do, and those are the guidelines that we will follow. CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN [GPE] [7.] [INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of national security and foreign policy, [INTERVIEWED]-and I must say parenthetically that you look very fit and relaxed for a man who just came back from Europe--nonetheless, your trip to [GPE] has encountered a substantial degree of hostility in this country, as you perhaps well know, and, rightly or wrongly, some people are suggesting that the [NORP] were the winners at [GPE] and we were the losers. What is your response to that criticism? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that is a completely inaccurate interpretation concerning the CSCE Conference in [GPE]. I think it is a judgment some people make, but I thoroughly disagree with it. Let me just put this in perspective, if I might. We predicated many of the decisions involving borders on what? Peace treaties signed by all of the countries in [DATE] and in [DATE]. No border was agreed to in [GPE] that was not previously agreed to by previous [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]s or by previous governments in other countries. We provided in that [GPE] agreement for peaceful change of borders. We made it far less likely that there will be military intervention by [CARDINAL] country against another. What we have really done is to make it possible for people in the East as well as in the West in Europe to communicate, to reestablish family relationships. We made it possible, if the agreement is lived up to. MR. [PERSON]. If the agreement is lived up to? [INTERVIEWED]. I will come to that in [TIME], [PERSON]. We have made it possible for the news media to have greater freedom in all of the [CARDINAL] countries. Now, the question you ask is a very good one. Will the agreement be maintained? In my speech before the Conference, I said, on paper this is good. We have [CARDINAL] years between now and the next meeting in [DATE], and the test will be, have all [CARDINAL] countries lived up to the agreement? It offers a hope. The reality will depend upon the execution. I happen to believe that world pressure will force all countries, [NORP] countries and other countries, to live up to the agreement. [INTERVIEWER]. But let us just take [CARDINAL] example, [INTERVIEWED]. You talk about a peaceful change in borders being in the agreement. Now realistically speaking, do you think that the [NORP] would give up the [NORP] territory, which they took over at the end of World War II? Do you think they would give up the [NORP] countries? Do you think that they would negotiate to give back these countries their independence? [INTERVIEWED]. Let me put it the other way around. If we had not gone to [GPE], do you think the [NORP] would have permitted any of the things you are talking about? In [GPE], they at least signed an agreement that says you can change borders by peaceful means. [INTERVIEWER]. But does it mean anything, [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, they have signed something that says you can change borders by peaceful means. Prior to [GPE], there was no such agreement. MR. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], you used a very good phrase at [GPE]. You said Peace is not a piece of paper, a very memorable phrase, and it conveys this idea that we are talking about now. Many of your critics--and let us take it all of the way from [PERSON] 1 to [PERSON], a former Under Secretary of [ORG]-have voiced concern about legitimizing what, for example, [PERSON] calls the [NORP] stolen empire, and asks, how do you reconcile that with Western ideals? 1Nobel laureate [PERSON]. The point [PERSON] makes, the point [PERSON] makes: that it is our obligation to follow policy that is more concerned with morality and principle than the acceptance of these borders would indicate. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [PERSON], I go back to the peace treaties of [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and the agreement by the [NORP] themselves to establish those borders. Those were peace treaties that established borders for all of Eastern Europe and all of Western Europe. Those are factual things done in [DATE], [DATE], et cetera. [ORG] did not change any of those, but it did say--and every one of the nations did sign--something that is different, that there can be peaceful adjustments of borders. [INTERVIEWER]. But despite what you are now saying, [INTERVIEWED], there is in this country, as you well know, a rising amount of criticism about detente itself, people questioning the value of detente. What is your feeling about this criticism, and do you think this is endangering detente? [INTERVIEWED]. I hope it is not endangering detente because I think there are many pluses to us and, yes, to [GPE]. It has to be a [CARDINAL]-way street. I believe that SALT I was an outgrowth of detente. Does anybody want to tear up SALT I? I do not think so. Anything that puts a lid or a limitation on the development of nuclear weapons, the expansion of nuclear weapons--any agreement that puts a lid or controls, that is good. So, detente helped achieve SALT I. Detente may help--I hope it will--SALT II, where we will put an actual cap on nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons systems. MR. [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] of the happiest dividends that detente could possibly produce would be a reduction of forces by [GPE] as well as the Western allies in Western Europe. [INTERVIEWED]. I agree. MR. [PERSON]. Was that raised at [GPE]? Did you get anywhere at all with that with [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. As you know, historically, when [ORG] was originally agreed to as a program, it was also agreed to that there would be negotiations for mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe--MBFR. Those negotiations have been going on now for [DATE]. They are presently stalled, but now that we have the [GPE] agreement, it is my judgment that we have opened up encouraging prospects for additional movement in the [ORG] negotiations. I think the [NORP] and the West are getting together for perhaps a new position. I believe that [GPE] and its allies are taking a look at the current stalemated negotiations and may come up with some agreement. The prospects for a mutual and balanced force reduction in Europe have been enhanced by the [GPE] agreement--no question about that whatsoever. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], to go back to [ORG] for a moment, you said at a recent news conference that according to your investigation the [NORP] had not cheated on the agreement limiting the use of certain strategic weapons. Your old friend, [PERSON], had written an article suggesting they had cheated. Since then, you have talked to Mr. [PERSON]. Have you changed your mind about what you said earlier? [INTERVIEWED]. I naturally investigated the allegations that were made by a number of people, including [PERSON]. And after a thorough investigation, I have come to the conclusion that a person might legitimately make the charge there had been violations, but on complete and total investigation I think any person who knew the facts as I know them would agree that there had been no violations of any consequence. There are some ambiguities--I want to be frank about it--but all of the responsible, knowledgeable people in the [ORG] or in any of the other responsible agencies would agree with me there have been no serious violations, and any that have been called to their attention have been Stopped. [INTERVIEWER]. But you are suggesting there have been some infractions, then? [INTERVIEWED]. Very minor, but we have what we call a consultative group where if we think they are violating something, we make that point. It is investigated, and in the cases where there was any instance that might be an honest charge of a violation, they have been stopped. [GPE] has raised some questions about certain activities that we have undertaken, and we have investigated them. And I think that arrangement of the consultative group has been very effective in making sure that SALT I was lived up to. [PERSON] [8.] [INTERVIEWER]. Let me turn now to the Middle East, [INTERVIEWED]. MR. [PERSON]. You beat me to it. [INTERVIEWER]. We have had intensive negotiations going on now for [DATE] to try to get a peace treaty moving in this area. What is the prospect? [INTERVIEWED]. They are better [DATE] than they were [DATE], and they are a lot better [DATE] than they were [DATE] when the negotiations unfortunately broke off. [INTERVIEWER]. Does this mean you are increasingly optimistic? [INTERVIEWED]. I am optimistic on an increasing basis, but I have learned that until it is signed in black and white that I should not predict that it will be finalized. MR. [PERSON]. Let me ask you--- [INTERVIEWER]. Pardon me, [PERSON]. I want to just ask you [CARDINAL] more question in this area. Do you find the [NORP] are now less troublesome in the Middle East in the efforts to achieve a peace agreement? [INTERVIEWED]. They have acted in a very responsible way, during my time, in the Middle East. Let me just turn to the question of these negotiations that are going on between [GPE] on the [CARDINAL] hand and [GPE] on the other. Both of those countries have to understand that flexibility at this crucial time is important for the peace of that area of the world and possibly peace in the world. [GPE] has to be more flexible; I think [GPE] has to respond. If there is not movement in the Middle East right now, the potential for war is increased significantly. And a war in the Middle East [DATE] has broader potential ramification than any time in the past, and we have had [CARDINAL] wars in the Middle East since [DATE] or [DATE]. A fifth one not only means that [GPE] will be fighting the [NORP] but the potential of a confrontation between [GPE] and [GPE] is a possibility. MR. [PERSON]. You must have raised that with [PERSON]. How did he react to it? [INTERVIEWED]. We talked about the Middle East. We told them, or I told him, what we were doing. Secretary [PERSON] had had a previous meeting with Foreign Minister [PERSON]. I repeat what I said [TIME], [PERSON]. [GPE] has acted in a very responsible way. I think they understand the potential consequences of no progress for continued peace and understanding in the Middle East. [INTERVIEWER]. What do you see, sir, as our future policy toward [GPE]? Do you think that we will recognize that [NORP] regime in the foreseeable future? [INTERVIEWED]. Their current actions certainly do not convince me that we should recognize [GPE] or [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. What about their application to get into [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. We have taken a very strong stand that we would not agree to the admission of [GPE] or [GPE] unless and until [GPE] is admitted. We believe in universality across the board. We do not believe in kicking nations out--kicking [GPE] out, for example. We think that would be bad policy. MR. [PERSON]. Did Mr. [PERSON] say he agreed with you on that--they were supporting that movement? [INTERVIEWED]. We let it be known very, very strongly that we believe [GPE] should be permitted to be a member of [ORG]. That is our position. But on the other hand, we also believe that if you believe in universality, which includes [GPE] North [GPE], you have to have [GPE]. SECRETARY OF STATE [PERSON] [9.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], when you first took office, you obviously relied a great deal upon Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON]. Do you now make more of the decisions on your own? Do you rely less upon Mr. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not going to get into that discussion. [PERSON] and I have the closest possible rapport, personally and professionally. I see him [DATE] for [TIME]. We talk about the Middle East. We talk about [ORG]. We talk about our total foreign policy. It is a good relationship. It has been from [DATE]. It is now, and I expect it to continue in the future. And I do not want to get into whether I do more or do less. We are a good team, and I think we have made some good decisions. [GPE] [10.] [INTERVIEWER]. Are you aware, [INTERVIEWED], of the criticism at the Capitol--- [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. [INTERVIEWER]. ---from [NORP] and not just [NORP], that in the [NORP] aid fight, for example, that Mr. [PERSON] was responsible for your losing that battle to lift the ban against military aid. [INTERVIEWED]. I have heard those arguments but I do not think they are valid. I think the [ORG], or [ORG] in this case, made the most serious wrong decision since I have been in [GPE], which is [DATE]. The [ORG] was totally wrong--or [ORG]. Why do I say that? First, they have not solved the [GPE] problem. Number [CARDINAL], they have weakened [ORG]. Number [CARDINAL], because of the [NORP] aid embargo, they have lessened our own national security capability by preventing us from using intelligence-gathering installations in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you saying [ORG] is harming our foreign policy? [INTERVIEWED]. There is no question about it. The decision of [ORG] to continue the [NORP] arms embargo has seriously jeopardized our foreign policy and undercuts in a significant way our own national security, including that of [ORG], and it has not solved--it has not solved the [GPE] problem. MR. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED], does not there have to be a concern for law? There was a law that said that aid that was given to [GPE] could not be used as it was used against [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. We have lived up to the law. We have stopped, because [ORG] told us to, the shipment of military hardware that the [NORP] bought and paid for. And incidentally, they bought and paid for the hardware, and because of [ORG] action, the [NORP] are now being charged warehouse storage fees for equipment that they own that [ORG] said they could not get. But anyhow, aside from that, which is, I think, a ridiculous development, we have lived up to the law. We are not sending them any military hardware, and unfortunately, the net result is what I told you. But, [PERSON], I think you have to recollect a little bit. Who started the problem in [GPE]? It was [ORG], it was the previous [NORP] Government that tried to throw [PERSON] out and assassinate him, and the previous [NORP] Government wanted to move in with [NORP] troops and take over [GPE]. And as a result of [NORP] violations, the [NORP] moved in and have, unfortunately, dominated the situation. But the whole program or the whole problem arose by the unwise action of the previous [NORP] Government. [PERSON]] [PERSON] [11.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], our time is almost out, and I must bring up a subject with which you are obviously quite familiar, namely, the rumors in this town that [PERSON] may not be your running mate in [DATE]. MR. [PERSON]. That he is going to be dumped. [INTERVIEWER]. IS he going to be dumped? Is he going to be back on the ticket? [INTERVIEWED]. I have read the various reports, and frankly, I think it is a tempest in a teapot. MR. [PERSON]. That is what he said. [INTERVIEWED]. I happen to agree with him. [PERSON] was selected by me because I think he would make and has made a first-class Vice [INTERVIEWED]. The realities of the political situation are I am going to go out with my campaign people to get my delegates. He, of course, will seek his delegates in the interim. I think the team of [PERSON] and [PERSON] has done a good job, and at this time, I do not see any reason to change it. MR. [PERSON]. Is the position you take one that might finesse Mr. [PERSON] out of the picture, too? [INTERVIEWED]. I only talk about the affirmative things, [PERSON]. I do not want to get into who did this or who did that or what is going to happen. The realities are [PERSON] has done an excellent job as [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]. He works hard. He is cooperative. He has taken every job I have given him and done really a great job. When you have somebody that works on a team with you, why do you want to change? [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], on behalf of [PERSON] and myself and all of us in [ORG], I would like to thank you for the privilege and the opportunity to come here and visit with you [DATE]. MR. [PERSON]. With which I concur. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. It has been very enjoyable.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpauldukewetatvthepresidentsrelationswithcongress", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you came to town, like [PERSON], as an outsider, but the results have been vastly different. How do you explain your mastery of the legislative branch? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not know whether I'd have the nerve to use that word mastery as you did. But I had [DATE] experience as Governor of [GPE] in which for [DATE] both houses of the legislature were of the opposing party, and we managed to get a great many reforms in-the welfare reforms that were so tremendously successful, things of that kind. But I came here with the same idea, that we are coequal branches of the government. They have got their problems, and it is a ease of common sense and consultation. And I have had [CARDINAL] formal meetings with the leadership of the [ORG] and the [ORG] here. I have gone to the [ORG] [CARDINAL] times myself, and I understand that for [DATE] that is kind of a record. [INTERVIEWER]. Senator [PERSON], the [NORP] leader, said that you have an instinctive feel for how the legislative branch works, and others who've come down to [ORG] say that you have also capitalized on your charm and your personality and your persistence. And I am wondering, did acting give you the training and the skills to sell your program to [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I suppose we are all the sum total of everything that is happened to us and all the experiences we have had in our lives. So, whether that contributed something or not, I do not know. I must say this about getting along with the [ORG]. I am deeply indebted to Senator [PERSON] and to Representative [PERSON], the Minority Leader in the [ORG], for the great cooperation and the help that I have had from them, the masterful job they have done in those [CARDINAL] positions that they hold as leader of the [ORG] and Minority Leader of the [ORG]. Also, when I say consultation, I find that the job of keeping track of what is up there, of not pulling surprises, of letting them know-we have a group in the administration here that is appointed expressly for the purpose of legislative strategy, to keep track of our own proposals-and I try to remember that the [INTERVIEWED] proposes and the [ORG] disposes-to keep track of these things. If there is something that we feel we'd have trouble with and, perhaps, have to find ourselves in a veto position, we see that they are aware of that and what it is that puts us in that position in advance, and then keep in constant touch. And it does not hurt, every once in a while in keeping in touch, to say some thank you's. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, you go beyond that, though, [INTERVIEWED], because, when you talk to people on the [ORG], there is a common refrain that comes through. They all say, we go down to [FAC], and [PERSON] is a terribly charming man. Is there a politics of affability which has served you well? Is that a real skill in getting things done? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not know whether it is a skill or not, but I like people. And I certainly do not meet them with a chip on my shoulder. I think of it as the [INTERVIEWED] is the only one in town who is elected to represent all the people. Their problems are that, as Senators, they are elected, yes, to represent the people of this country, but, also, to have in mind the particular interests of their [ORG] and the problems of their [ORG]. A Representative, again, represents all the people, but also has specific things that he is responsible for with regard to his congressional district. So, I know that. And I know that they, too, have problems. And these problems have to be reconciled. And sometimes it is going to weigh on them that something that they might be able to feel might have some benefit nationwide, but would be at a cost to their district or their [ORG], that they cannot support, and so you try to reconcile all of those viewpoints. [INTERVIEWER]. And that is difficult, because we know that there is a great deal of hypocrisy which goes on at all times. I mean, we know that Members will get up on the floor, and they will do a great deal of grandstanding, and they will talk about cutting [ORG] spending. And then they will be running down to [ORG] or running to some of the agencies, demanding that no cuts be made in my tobacco subsidies or my sugar subsidies, or the dam project that you want for back home, additionally. How do you deal with all that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, again, as I say, it is one in which you-I can understand their responsibilities for those particular areas or projects of their district or [ORG]. And then I have to weigh that against the advantage or disadvantage for the whole country. And if it is one in which they must lose, that the national benefit outweighs the local benefit, then it is just a case of presenting that to them. And you'd be surprised how many times they recognize that the overall national good has to come first. [INTERVIEWER]. So you see it, though, primarily as a matter of give and take on both sides, your side as well as their side. [INTERVIEWED]. Yeah. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I think one of the things which surprised us a great deal in [GPE] was that you turned out to be a far better politician than a lot of us thought you would be. And people will tell me that you have a gritty, competitive side to your personality. Do you enjoy the attack and counterattack that characterizes so much of the warfare between [ORG] and [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have not thought of it as warfare. There is a kind of competitive thing to this. But in the last analysis, you have to come down on the side of what you feel inside is right, and then you do your utmost to convince someone who is in an adversary position at the time why you feel you are right and why you feel you must take the position that you do and have what you have asked for. [INTERVIEWER]. But that is the motivating force as you see it. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. When you get into battles with [ORG], obviously there is a matter of timing-when do you call Senator X who is been wavering; when do you make the practical compromise; how do you decide that? How involved do you yourself get in the legislative strategy of [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I must be honest and confess that it would be impossible with all that is on my plate to know the timing of things of that kind. And so, there I depend on, again, this group in [ORG] to tell me, because-in other words, is something coming up in committee; is it coming to the floor; is this the time now; and that it is the best time to make the call before something comes to a vote. So, I depend on them for that. [INTERVIEWER]. But do you feel that the experience you have gained as Governor of [GPE], in dealing with [ORG], has enabled you to have this sense of timing, to know when to move, when to maneuver? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think from experience, yes, you have some of that. You could do it too soon-and memories are short-and it is worn off by the time the vote comes. [INTERVIEWER]. But you also have to be constantly vigilant, always protecting your flanks, do not you? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, yes. [INTERVIEWER]. It is not totally, [PERCENT] favorable from the [ORG] standpoint, [INTERVIEWED]. While everybody does talk about your affability and the fact that they come down-they love to come down to see you, and they love the stories which you spin-you also get another side from some Members who say that you are not always strong on substance, that sometimes you are out of touch, and that sometimes you have too simplistic a view of things. How do you see yourself? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I know there are criticisms of that kind. I do not particularly admit that the criticisms are justified. I think now and then to use an anecdote saves a lot of words sometimes to be able to tell something that illustrates what it is we are trying to do. If you have some example, for example, of bureaucratic dillydallying or repetitive things that are not needed and you can tell that example, it saves several paragraphs of just trying to reason with someone in explaining what it is that you are trying to correct. And I find, though, it is not only that you come down at the moment of consultation-for example, something to do with foreign policy right now and the act that requires consultation with the [ORG] with regard to-well, my announcement recently of saying that in principle, if it was essential to bring peace to the Middle East and to [GPE], the use of [NORP] troops in a multinational force. But [DATE], I did not wait-they had not been invited, so there is nothing to go to the [ORG] about-but since the word was out and was in the press and had been leaked that this had happened, I had a very fine meeting with the leadership of the [ORG] on this in explaining exactly where we were and so forth, in advance, a totally informal meeting that would precede, if the need arises, when I must go to them formally. And I understand that some of them from both parties went out and said it was one of the best meetings of that kind they'd ever had. [INTERVIEWER]. But would you concede, [INTERVIEWED], by nature that you are the kind of political leader who sees the broad, general picture and is not that interested in the specifics or the detail of a lot of legislative matters? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I think I brought that from the experience in [GPE], that I know the importance of the detail. My job, of course, is to sell-if there is a dispute there-is to sell the overall goal that we are trying to achieve. And so I center on that. [INTERVIEWER]. There are also complaints about the administration's managerial style, [INTERVIEWED]. In talking with many [NORP] at the [FAC] in [DATE], I find a common thread running through what they say. Most of them say we do not have that much quarrel with the [INTERVIEWED] himself, but they do say that your agents and the administration's representatives on the [ORG] frequently are too arrogant, that they do not return phone calls, that they do not pay attention to the advice given from [ORG], that they are insensitive to the political needs of Members of [ORG]. Are you aware of that? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think it is true. I think anyone can find some incident or some oversight or something and complain about it. But I have to again say that I became accustomed in [DATE] in [GPE], and already here, that there is a tendency to invent a palace guard and pretend that the [INTERVIEWED] is being protected from the palace guard, and therefore is not aware of these things. I know that in the hectic pace that now and then something can slip by. I have not heard anyone-if there is anyone on our side that is being arrogant, I certainly want to know about it. But I do not know of anyone that is, and I have not had that complaint come to me. Now, I get the summary of all of the mail also, and it is a considerable reading problem, the congressional mail. And so that is not ignored. And I see all those letters that are written-and some with an individual or particular problem or some with a group of [ORG] or Senators-that is all put on my desk. [INTERVIEWER]. So, you do not feel that the ship may be run a little too loosely, that perhaps you have delegated too much authority? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], there is also the matter of comity between the legislative and the executive branches-the bond of respect. And some of the [NORP] at the [ORG] say there is a problem in that they will negotiate deals with the [NORP], and then [ORG] officials and others will come along and undermine those deals. And this makes it much more difficult, that it affects their credibility at the [FAC]. [INTERVIEWED]. That, I think, is a part of the whole process that goes on. Let us take the economic program [DATE] in the combination of the tax program and the budget reductions. We did not get all we wanted, and we had to-in addition to not getting everything we asked for, we also had to take some things that we had not asked for. Now, that is a case of in the give and take in the legislature, of what they can get. Well, then, still I am a party to that also, and I have to speak up, or my representatives, if there is a price that we feel is too high. I cannot accept something that is totally contrary to the principle that we are trying to obtain in that program. And the same was true of this most recent budget bill. That was not the bill that I would have submitted-and there were [CARDINAL] versions on the floor at one time, most of which were unacceptable, because they would not do the job, and they would not come close to the goal we are trying to achieve. But they did evolve one that I could call back and say, yes, this one I support. Now, I am sure that someone, say, on our side who has negotiated something and been willing to give to get something in there, can be a little irked if I do not agree that he was paying the right price. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you have started to veto some of these bills now. Can we expect a lot more vetos in [DATE] and [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. If they are budget-busters, yes. I said that. They have passed a resolution, a budget resolution. I realize that that must be followed by appropriation bills. If they ignore the ceilings that have been put in the budget resolution, which they can do, send an appropriation that would, if passed, have the budget go way beyond the bounds that were set, then I have to veto it. [INTERVIEWER]. We are also into an election campaign, and it may be [DATE] for the [NORP]. Some of the polls indicate that. If the [NORP], for example, pick up [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], or [CARDINAL] seats in [ORG], what happens to your conservative majority? How will that affect your program? [INTERVIEWED]. Well-in the [ORG], you say? [INTERVIEWER]. In the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, if they only pick up [CARDINAL], then we have won a great victory, because if you look back in history, the first off-year election the party that is out of power in [ORG] normally picks up [CARDINAL] seats. That is just been traditional. And so you start from behind with this bielection that is coming up. And I am just-I'd like to pick up some more. I'd like to have more [ORG] in there than we have. But I understand I would be bucking tradition and history. So, when you use that figure [CARDINAL], that would be [CARDINAL] as many as traditionally you are supposed to lose. [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON] and [PERSON] have mixed it up a bit. He says he likes the [NORP] side of you, that he wishes you were a little more [NORP] and a little less [NORP]. [INTERVIEWED]. [Laughing] I will tell you, [PERSON] and I, we get along fine. There is nothing personal in our contest. And, actually, there is nothing really political. It is philosophical. [PERSON] really and sincerely and honestly believes in the philosophy-which I once believed in and found I could no longer follow-of taxing and spending and government trying to do things that I think are beyond government's proper province. And he sincerely believes that. So, it is a battle of philosophies between us. But, as [PERSON] said, come [TIME], we are friends. [INTERVIEWER]. And you are still friends? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you sit here [DATE] grappling with the affairs of state, do you ever wish that you had run for the [ORG] from [GPE] as you once considered? Do you ever wish that you were up there instead of being here? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I never considered running for the [ORG]. I was asked once to run for the [ORG] when I was a [NORP] and-by fellow party members-and said, no, I liked the career I had. I never in my life intended or believed that I would ever have a desire to run for office. And it was in [DATE], after the [DATE] election, when our party in [GPE] was badly shattered, that people began pressing me to run for the Governorship. And it got to the place that neither [PERSON] or I could sleep. They kept emphasizing that they felt that this was the only way that we could pull the party together and that I could win. And I have to confess something. I honestly believe that when I finally gave in, very reluctantly, and said yes, I really had not thought beyond winning the election. And it dawned on me after I'd said yes that if I won the election, I was going to have a job for [DATE]. No, I was never tempted to seek a legislative position, certainly not after serving as Governor. [INTERVIEWER]. Anyway, you prefer being [INTERVIEWED] to being a Senator. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. I want to thank you very much for the visit here, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is been my pleasure.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpetermaermutualnbcradio", "text": "Meeting With [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. Good [TIME], [INTERVIEWED]. We are very pleased to have this opportunity for this first radio interview with you. Some foreign policy questions, if I may, to start off. What will be item [CARDINAL] on the table when you sit down with [NORP] leader [PERSON] in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. To be sure that we are not operating in a way that there will be unnecessary misunderstanding. In other words, I use the analogy of [CARDINAL] big ships passing in [TIME]: I do not want that to happen. I want to be on the same wavelength as much as we can. So, I would say the meeting is designed to see that the [CARDINAL] ships do not pass in the night for lack of light. [INTERVIEWER]. But what specifically will you bring up first? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I say, we have not ever set an agenda. Clearly, I will be interested in getting his views on the dynamic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. We will have detailed conversations about his economy, and I will be glad to talk to him about ours. And so, I think along those [CARDINAL] areas you will see a lot of discussion. And also, I will be bringing up, and I expect he will be prepared to discuss, regional tensions: problems in this hemisphere, support for [GPE], for example; [GPE]; other areas where [NORP] interest and [GPE] do not parallel each other. [INTERVIEWER]. You sent him a message in reply to his earlier cable, again saying that you support the reforms going on in his country and in Eastern Europe. Do you support them to the extent that you'd put your money where your mouth is, so to speak, and grant the [NORP] some sort of economic assistance to spur those reforms? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am perfectly prepared to discuss economic reforms and what the [NORP] would like to see in terms of interest from the West. But I noted with great interest Mr. [PERSON]'s [Foreign Minister] view when asked a similar question. He said: We are not looking for aid. We are not wanting somebody to bail us out. That is good. They are a sovereign state, have a high degree of pride -- but clearly, there will be a discussion of economic matters as they affect [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. When you say, as you did in a speech [DATE], that the [GPE] summit -- the [GPE] meeting, as you all here prefer to call it -- will not be used to negotiate the future of Europe, what does that mean? Are you taking something off the table there? [INTERVIEWED]. No. What I am saying is we are not going to have a [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. To what extent? When you are not -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. To the extent that it is not the role of [GPE] and [GPE] to divide up things or alter borders or do some of the things that took place at the meeting I have just referred to. We are not going to get into that. It is a broad, general meeting -- we would not do it anyway. General [PERSON] of [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Another part of the world. Have you, indeed, approved a covert plan that allows the [ORG] to recruit people to overthrow [PERSON] in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Of course I'd love to see [PERSON] out there, but you know I never discuss intelligence. I was head of the intelligence community for [DATE], [DATE] -- [DATE] -- and one thing that I know you do not do is discuss covert action or rumors about covert action, or confirm or deny covert action. And I wish other people would conduct themselves in that same manner, and then maybe some of the efforts of an intelligence community could be more effective. So, I will not confirm or deny anything of that nature. Now, if you'd like me to state would we like to see [PERSON] out of office -- absolutely. [INTERVIEWER]. I know you want him out of office. How far will you go to get him out? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that is a question that is so open-ended it cannot possibly be answered. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, let me ask you this. Since you will not answer that and you will not talk about the specific plan, do you still feel that your hands are tied? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not saying there is a specific plan. [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. Since you will not even confirm whether there is a specific plan -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Now we are going, now we are talking. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. -- -- do you still feel your hands are tied by [ORG] on matters like this? This matter specifically? [INTERVIEWED]. No, not on this matter specifically, and if there were to be a plan -- and I think we have a pretty good understanding with [ORG] at this point, in the [ORG] and in the [ORG]. [NORP] Reunification [INTERVIEWER]. Back to Eastern Europe. Is reunification of the [CARDINAL] [NORP] -- is that inevitable? [INTERVIEWED]. I gave my view on that, and I said that that was a matter for the people of the [NORP] to determine. And it is a highly sensitive matter as far as [GPE] is concerned, and it is better to leave it right there. [INTERVIEWER]. But when you look at the way events are going there, is it inevitable in your opinion? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that is very hypothetical because there are so many things that can intervene. And I would say it is a matter for the determination of the [NORP] people. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, many people look at the history books, and they worry about that prospect. Is that a legitimate concern? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have had discussions with countries that express concerns in this regard because of certain historical precedents, but I do not think that history need repeat itself if there evolves a single [NORP] State. But that is down the road, and it is not something that is being pressed. And I repeat: That is a matter for the determination of the [NORP] people. Defense Budget Cuts [INTERVIEWER]. Some Members of [ORG] look at this situation in Europe, and they see it as ripe for debate on considering cutting the defense budget, taking a big chunk out of it. Does that make sense to you? [INTERVIEWED]. No, it does not make sense to me. Military Reductions in Europe [INTERVIEWER]. What about reducing [ORG] and [ORG] forces there? A lot of people think -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. We already have made proposals. We have a bold proposal, a leadership proposal by [GPE] that has wide support amongst our allies, to do exactly that. [INTERVIEWER]. Will that be on the table in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is on the table now. [INTERVIEWER]. If [PERSON] comes in, and he says why do not we agree to it here? -- a lot of experts think that he will come in and say that. [INTERVIEWED]. He is already agreed to it in principle. [GPE] has -- there is no great debate on the principles of the reductions that we have proposed. But the problem is we are hammering out a lot of detail now that cannot be done at a [GPE] meeting or that has to be done in a multilateral forum. And so, I have been very pleased that the [NORP] have been quite supportive of this [GPE]-NATO initiative. [INTERVIEWER]. Would you be willing to use the [GPE] meeting as a setting to sign off on such an agreement once -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. I do not want to elevate the expectations of a watching world. That is not going to take place at [GPE] because the details have not been worked out in the multilateral forum where they are being discussed in [GPE]. It just will not be ready by then. [INTERVIEWER]. Quick domestic question -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. My hope is that it can meet the timetables I set and the alliance set. And they were very ambitious. But it is not [DATE]. Abortion [INTERVIEWER]. Quick domestic question. Will you sign this [GPE] appropriations bill that includes allowing the use of local funds for abortions for poor women? [INTERVIEWED]. I have made very clear that I -- they can test me all they want; they can package it any way they want, but if it expands the use of federally appropriated funds for abortion, I am not going to sign it. And I have been very honest and direct with the [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. This is local funds. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me see what it is then, if there is something different. But if it is appropriated federally, why, I have great difficulty with that, and have been very open with the [ORG] on it. [INTERVIEWER]. This is still a very painful subject for you, is not it? [INTERVIEWED]. It is, I do not like it. I know that our party is big enough to have people in it who differ on this question. There is no question about that. If that were not true, I guess I would not have been elected [INTERVIEWED], because this issue was widely presented to the [NORP] people and very openly debated in debates with Mr. [PERSON], who felt quite differently about it. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, if the party is big enough, why is it that policymakers in the health area are required to share your views before they are -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Because I was elected to perform on certain things. They do not have to share them on every iota -- crossing every t and dotting every i -- but I am [INTERVIEWED]. I was elected to do certain things. And I want somebody in housing that can support the general initiative on housing. I want people on health that share my respect for human life. I want people in [ORG] that like to see this deficit come down in a certain way. That is not such a radical concept. The [INTERVIEWED]'s Dog [INTERVIEWER]. They tell me the time is up. I have to ask 7E7Eone 7E7Ekicker. 7E7ECan 7E7Eyou 7E7Econfirm 7E7Ethese widespread [ORG] stories that your dog has been eating rats and squirrels? [INTERVIEWED]. She is doing her part. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. Has she been eating rats and squirrels? [INTERVIEWED]. Not eating them. [INTERVIEWER]. Just killing them. [INTERVIEWED]. Our dog is a fearless hunter, and what she does on her own time -- that is her business. [INTERVIEWER]. What does it tell us -- that there are rats in the [FAC] yard here? [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I just want to keep them out of the swimming pool. One jumped in there when [PERSON] was swimming. And we are relying heavily on [PERSON] to cut that down. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much. [INTERVIEWED]. There was a mouse in this very room you are sitting in. I hope that does not terrify you, but he was done in [DATE], too. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much for joining us, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. Not at all.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithphiladlerkrldradiodallastexas", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], are you there? [INTERVIEWED]. I am, [PERSON]. Economic Program [INTERVIEWER]. Good [TIME] to you. We think that a lot of people responded to a theme, or at least I think so, in the [INTERVIEWED]ial campaign of sacrifice to cut the deficit as long as that sacrifice is equal. The Btu tax was designed originally on the concept of equal sacrifice. But then all of these exceptions were added, and it really makes it appear that it is one of the most complicated proposals ever. Did you make a mistake allowing all the special exceptions to be included in the Btu tax? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I did not allow them all to be included. Some of them were included in the [ORG] bill, and I did not agree with all of them. But let me say what I think was a good criticism of the tax and that is that we wanted the tax to restrain energy consumption in ways that promoted energy conservation and also supported fuel switching to more environmentally beneficial and more available natural gas. That bill, as drawn, would be a big boon to the natural gas industry in [GPE] and [GPE] and throughout [GPE]. And that is one of the things we were trying to do. Now, some of the oil companies did not like it, but the people that were in the gas business liked it. We had a big [GPE] gas company, headed by a person who strongly supported [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] in the last election, endorsed the economic program. [ORG] and [ORG] both endorsed the economic program, including the Btu tax. So Secretary [PERSON], who, as you know, has represented you in the [ORG] for a long time, offered the [ORG] a modified Btu tax which, instead of having all those particular exemptions, would basically have alleviated the burden of the Btu tax on industry and agriculture on the production sector but still given them an incentive to move toward natural gas wherever possible and would also have cut the Btu rate and would have replaced that with more spending cuts. From my point of view, unfortunately, we could not pass that through the committee because Senator [PERSON] had said he would not vote for any tax based on the heat content of fuel. But I still think it was a good concept, and it will be interesting to see what happens if the [ORG]'s version of the economic plan passes, to see what happens in the conference and what we come up with. [INTERVIEWER]. What we have now is a gasoline tax that is been passed by the [ORG] committee, and you have called that regressive in the past. How can you sell that, if you have to, to [ORG] Members who did risk some political capital by supporting you on the Btu tax? [INTERVIEWED]. I think anything that comes out has to be a combination of agreement between the [ORG] and the [ORG]. It is hard to get [CARDINAL] [ORG] Members and [CARDINAL] Senators to agree on anything that is tough. I mean, everybody can talk about cutting the deficit, but it is [CARDINAL] thing to talk about it and quite another to do. But I think they will be able to do it. No one was particularly happy with the form of the Btu tax, or very few people were, that passed the [ORG], but everybody thought that Secretary [PERSON] could come up with a plan that would make it good for the economy and could achieve what we were trying to do in terms of promoting domestic energy, and I think he did. The [ORG] preferred a tax that was a gas tax and a tax on some other fuels. It, at least, is small enough so that it is not particularly unfair to people in rural areas. It is not as big as what some had wanted, and certainly I did not want just a big old gas tax. I thought that was unfair. I also think it is important to point out in [GPE], in light of the rhetoric in the recent political campaign, that it is simply not true that there is no spending cuts in this plan. There is [MONEY] in spending cuts, and they affect everything. They affect agriculture and veterans and [ORG] and the whole range of discretionary spending of the Government. They affect foreign aid; they affect defense. There are sweeping, broad-based spending cuts in this program. And the tax increases, [CARDINAL] of them, fall on people with incomes [MONEY], 000, [CARDINAL] on people with incomes [MONEY], 000. Families of [CARDINAL] with incomes [MONEY] are held harmless, and people who work for a living [TIME] a week and have kids in the house who are now in poverty would actually be lifted above poverty by these tax changes in ways that promote the movement from welfare to work. So this is a fair and balanced plan. It was developed, and in a very aggressive way, by [PERSON] and by [PERSON], who used to be chairman of [ORG], to be fair, to have equal spending cuts in taxes, and to drive the deficit down so we could bring interest rates down. That is good for [GPE], and that is good for everybody in [GPE]. And also, it leaves some room for investments that are critical to our future. And as you know, I support-you were implying this before I got on-I support the space station and the super collider projects because I think they are good for [GPE]'s future. And if you are going to spend money on those things, you have to spend money on them. You cannot play games; they do cost some money. Space Station and Super Collider [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], how long can you guarantee that support for the super collider and the space station? Will they fall if that is the only way to meet your overall deficit reduction goal? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, my overall deficit reduction goals can be met in my plan with the space station and the super collider. I do want to emphasize that we have already shaved [MONEY] off the [DATE] budget for the space station and some money off the [DATE] budget for the super collider by redesigning the space station, based on a team of exceptional national experts who analyzed the project and recommended that it be redesigned and also that [ORG]'s management be changed rather dramatically. And we just delayed the implementation schedule on the super collider some, so that none of the opponents of the space station and the super collider could claim that there had been no spending cut there. So we have done that. But I strongly feel it would be a mistake to abandon those. Now, I would be less than candid if I did not tell you that there are a lot of people in other parts of the country who want to cut those projects. There was always a lot of opposition to them, and because of the last election and all of the rhetoric and all the claims in [GPE] that there were no spending cuts in this budget, that has given real energy to the opponents of the space station and the super collider. It was not true that there were no spending cuts, but there are a lot of people up there who have been wanting to kill these projects for [DATE] who are just gleeful at the way the rhetoric in the last election played out in [GPE]. They think that they have been given a license by the people of [GPE] to kill the space station and the super collider. And it is going to be very much harder for me to keep them alive. But I am doing the best I can. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I am informed that our time has run out, by [CARDINAL] of your aides, I believe. Good to talk with you [TIME]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. I enjoyed it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithphoenixtelevisionhongkong", "text": "[GPE]-U.S. Relations [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you for selecting [ORG] for this interview. What greeting and message would you like to convey to the [NORP] people prior to your visit to [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. First, that the relationship between [GPE] and [GPE] is an important relationship. It is a mixed relationship. There is a lot of good that we are doing together, and there is a lot of areas where we may not have full agreement but, nevertheless, are able to discuss our disagreements in a very cordial way. And so I would tell the people of [GPE] you live in a great, massive country that is growing well and that we want to have good relations with you. [INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to [GPE] [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. This will be your third formal visit to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. What do you hope to achieve with this visit? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the visit is giving me a chance to further get to know the leadership. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] is a person who I enjoy visiting with. He is a smart fellow. And the more you get to know a person, the better-the easier it is to make good policy. Secondly, I am going to, of course, be going to [GPE] to represent the interests of my people. I will talk about the need for trade that is free and fair. I will talk about the currency, of course. I will talk about intellectual property rights that the [INTERVIEWED] and I have discussed before. And then on the international front we will , of course-I will confirm my [CARDINAL] [GPE], [CARDINAL]-communique policy, that not only says that we do not support independence but as well, we will adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act. I think that is important for the [NORP] leadership and the people of [GPE] to hear. We have also got an agenda to fight terrorism, fight narcotrafficking, as well as to work together to convince the leader of [GPE] that the Korean Peninsula should be nuclear weapons-free. So we have got a broad agenda. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Keep you busy. [INTERVIEWED]. It will keep us busy, but it is an important agenda, and the people of [GPE] must understand that when [GPE] and [GPE] works together, we can accomplish a lot. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. You brought up [GPE]. I remember in [DATE] and [DATE] you made strong statements regarding Taiwan-- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. --and regarding the recent development, do you feel less concern about a cross-strait situation than you were in, like, [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am always concerned that [CARDINAL] party or the other will do something unilaterally to change the status quo, which would then create, you know, a source of angst and anger. And therefore, I am constantly reiterating my position so that both sides clearly know the position of [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Are you optimistic about a peaceful resolution in the end? [INTERVIEWED]. I have seen some-yes, I am optimistic there will be a peaceful resolution. Secondly, I am optimistic because I have seen cross-straits discussion starting to take place. And I urge the parties to continue those discussions. I believe it is possible, through discussion and good will, to end up solving this issue in a peaceful way. [GPE]-U.S. Relations [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. You call [GPE] relationship complicated. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. And we heard [GPE] officials and experts have variously called [GPE] a threat, a partner, a competitor, and an opportunity. So how do you see [GPE], and what is your plan to deal with [GPE]'s emergence? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that is interesting- all the different adjectives I guess kind of express a complicated relationship. I would say-I think we have got a lot of issues to deal with, is the best way to describe it. And on issues on which we agree, we can make positive contributions and change. Issues we do not necessarily agree on, we can work through and do so in a frank way. And I repeat, I think we have a fantastic opportunity by working with [GPE] and other countries to make sure that the Korean Peninsula is nuclear weapons-free, which will lay a foundation for a peace in the region and the hemisphere, and that is important. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. You brought up [GPE]. What other issues do you most seek [GPE]'s support and cooperation? And what do you expect them to do? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, on [ORG] we work on every issue together. And [CARDINAL] way for us to be able to work together is just to share opinions on different issues. For example, I will bring up [GPE]. I want the [INTERVIEWED] to understand how I think it is important for the free world and the peaceful world to work together to convince the [NORP] not to develop a nuclear weapon. [GPE] has got influence. [GPE] is a big, powerful nation. And therefore, it is in our interest that we share ideas and work together. I will also want to continue discussions on the economic front, because we have got a big trade imbalance with [GPE], but we are making progress. The [NORP] took a good first step on having a market currency; I believe they ought to do more. The [INTERVIEWED] made a very strong statement in [GPE] about intellectual property rights. We have reached a textile agreement, which is a very important signal to our folks who want to make sure that the [INTERVIEWED] works for fair trade. And with the trade balance as big as it is, you know, it is important for people here in [GPE] to be able to say to themselves, We hope it is fair. And I am going to continue to insist on fair trade as well. Finally, there is a couple of other areas we can work on, if you have got a second. [CARDINAL] is energy. We consume a lot of energy. [GPE] is consuming more energy. And we need to share information and share technologies so both of us can diversify away from hydrocarbons. [INTERVIEWED]'s [DATE] Visit to [GPE] [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. My last question, in [DATE] you visited [GPE], when your father was [GPE] Representative in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I did. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. I know you spent your 29th birthday there-- [INTERVIEWED]. That is right. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. --and went back a number of visit over [DATE]. Can you share with us some of the memories that made the deepest impression on you when you think of [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think of how different [GPE] is [DATE] than it was in [DATE]. In [DATE]-first of all, I had a fantastic experience when I went there in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Good to know. [INTERVIEWED]. I really did. It was great. It was really interesting. The [CARDINAL] impressions-a couple of impressions. [CARDINAL], everybody was on bicycles; there were not many automobiles. I happened to be one of the people on bicycles. I rode all over the place in [GPE], which was fascinating. Secondly, I can remember how odd people thought I looked. In other words, there was not much exposure to the West, and all of a sudden an [NORP] starts riding a bike amongst them, and it, frankly, surprised some people. And thirdly, I noticed there was uniformity in dress. People wore the same style clothes. And that is changed, which means there is a market; people are beginning to express their own individual desires and somebody is meeting those desires with a product. There is high-rise buildings that are magnificent. When I went to [GPE] right after [DATE], I was-it was mind-boggling to look at the fantastic buildings that had been built between the airport and the old town. So this is a country that has progressed a lot since [DATE], which shows the vast potential of [GPE]. And it explains to people-it should explain to people in [GPE] why it is important for our Government to have a good working relationship-as complex as it is, but to have a good working relationship. And we do. And that is in the interest not only of our respective people but it is in the interest of the world. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks for coming. [INTERVIEWER [CARDINAL]]. I wish you a very good trip to Asia and a successful visit to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpiersmorganthespectatorgoodmorningbritain", "text": "Mr [INTERVIEWED], how are you? I am good thank you, [PERSON]. It is been a while! It has, since you became my Champion on the Apprentice. Well that was [DATE]. Can you believe it? It is a long time but I appreciate all the nice things you have said, and every once in a while a hit, but that is OK. I always say that you do not mind criticism if it is not hysterical. That is true. You do not mind listening to criticism, do you? That is true. No I do not , if it is real. If it is fake, I do not like it. I mean when they give you false stories, and there is so much of it in the media, but you have always been very fair. And you really are a talented guy. Look, you were on the Apprentice, and I would not say you were the most popular person in the sense of the other people liking you, but you were the smartest person and that had something to do with your victory. I actually found the quote that you said to me. This is exactly at the moment you made me your Apprentice. Go ahead. I do not know if you can remember what you said, but you said this. You said '[PERSON], you are a vicious guy. I have seen it. You can try and dispute it. You are tough, you are smart, you are probably brilliant... You are certainly not diplomatic, but you did an amazing job, and you beat the hell out of everybody, and you won by far more than anybody'. That is true. Watching your campaign, it looked like you'd stolen my playbook Mr [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is been an interesting campaign, and you know, often times they say that [PERSON] was a terrible candidate. They never said I was a great candidate, but we won. It was a convincing win. It was an electoral college - I guess it was like [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. You remember that it could never be [CARDINAL]. I'd love to do popular vote, it would be such a thing. I would love to do a popular vote, but it is a much different kind of a contest. I think it would be actually an easier way of doing it, but the electoral college is nice because it gets you into so many different states that you would not see otherwise. But we had a great campaign and we won, and the country is doing fantastically well. Some people think you did not actually want to win. Well, that is such a false story. That is fake news, that was in that fake book. But that is such a false story. I mean first of all, you know me, and I actually though I was going to win because I'd go to stadiums and we'd have [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL], 000 people in the stadiums. We would have a fever pitch, it was incredible what was happening [DATE] of the campaign. And coming into [DATE] I thought we were going to win. We were getting massive crowds. My opponent was not getting good crowds at all. She was getting, you know, singers and entertainers to fill up the stadiums. They'd finish singing and then everybody would leave and she was left there. So I am telling you, I really thought I was going to win, and I very much wanted to win. If I did not win I would have been very disappointed. You have had [DATE]. Whether people love you or loathe you, it is been extraordinarily eventful. Depending on who you talk to, you are either delivering on a lot of your promises, beginning to make [GPE] great as you vowed, or, and you know the other [CARDINAL] of this, you are a raging tweeting wrecking ball who is destroying the country and terrifying the entire planet. How do you plead? I plead not guilty. To all of it? Or the second bit? I think I shakes things up. It had to be shaken up. The country had to be shaken up. We are doing incredibly on an economic basis. Financial - stock market just hit another new high. We have had [CARDINAL] - since the election - [CARDINAL] new market highs. Think of that. It is incredible. It is never happened before. It is a record. That in itself is a record. During the course of [DATE] we have had - think of it - [CARDINAL] stock market records. It is going to go higher. Regulation - nobody's done anywhere near like I have done. That is also a record, a world record for [INTERVIEWED]s. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill - not easy to get. Many people have tried to do it, they were not able to do it, and this is the biggest one we have ever passed, bigger than the [PERSON] bill. And it is had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. And people... How significant was the [ORG] move? Well, I thought it was great, but that was [CARDINAL] move. They are going to invest [MONEY], they are going to build plants all over the place, they are going to build a college, they are going to build this incredible campus. They are fantastic. So it is a [MONEY] investment, which I guess is probably the largest - or certainly right up there - largest ever made by a company. So we are doing very well, people are coming back into the country in droves. [CARDINAL] thing very exciting to me is [ORG] - they are leaving [GPE] and they are going back to [GPE]. You have not heard that in a long time. We are doing things that nobody thought possible and the country is becoming very very strong again economically. Unemployment is at record lows. Women unemployment - [DATE]. Think of it, [DATE]. Black unemployment - the best record in history, the history of our country. [NORP] unemployment, best. [NORP] unemployment, best in the history of the country. All of the things that I said on the campaign trail coming true, so I am very happy about it. A lot of people will listen to that - a lot of people do not want to give you any credit - but a lot of that is indisputable. The economy is in good shape. The global economy is in good shape. And that is been taking... a lot of the global economy [PERSON] is because of how well we are doing. Most people will not admit that, but we are doing well, that is helping all around the globe. That is a very good thing. Your supporters get frustrated that a lot of the tweeting - the tweetstorms, the controversies, some of the more outlandish things that you occasionally say - that they distract from that kind positive message. Do you accept that? Do you care? I do not think it is so many of my supporters. I think a lot of other people, they use that... I do not call it tweeting, I call it social media. And you are a big social media man by the way. you do great with it. And I think you might agree with that statement. I like your tweets. I like the kind of unfettered access to [INTERVIEWED]'s mind in real time. If I was not able to do that - I call it a [DATE] form of communication, OK - if I was not able to do that, because I get a lot of fake news, I get a lot of news that is very false, very made up. You saw all of the stories that were wrong [DATE]. I mean [CARDINAL] of the stories was so wrong it drove the stock market down substantially and it was wrong. They have made a lot of mistakes and lot of them were made on purpose. If I do not have that form of communication, I cannot defend myself. Unless I am going to have a news conference [TIME]... Do you actually tweet yourself? I do. I do. I also give it to people and sometimes I will have - I had [CARDINAL] case where a lawyer did a tweet, you know they'd call it. I have a man, [PERSON], and I have people that are with me, you know [PERSON]] and you know [PERSON]]... The whole world waits for you to wake up, on tenterhooks. ...It is a crazy situation. Are you actually lying in bed with your phone working out how to wind everybody up? Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever. But generally speaking during [TIME] or during [TIME], I can do that, but I am very busy during the day - very long hours, I am busy - and sometimes I will just dictate out something really quickly and they will give it to [CARDINAL] of my people to put it up. There is been a few big events in [DATE], one of which was the big Women's March on the first anniversary of your inauguration. The #MeToo and the [ORG] campaigns have really resonated with [CARDINAL] of women. And they partly hold you to blame for a lot of attitude towards women. Do you have a message for them? Because we are [DATE] on from the last time there were all these marches, a lot is happening in that area of sexual harassment and you have seen what is happened in [GPE] and so on. What message could you give these women who are marching that you are for them and not the problem? Well, I am for them and I think a lot of them understand that. You know, I won many categories of women and the women vote in the election, and people were shocked to see it. I was running against a woman and I am winning all of these categories. You know that better than anybody. And I think I would do even better right now... In fact we have just had polls coming out [TIME], just before I walked into the room that are really up tremendously. I think that is maybe because of the economy, but I just said before that women have the best unemployment numbers that they have had in [DATE]. And they are doing tremendously in business, they are doing tremendously in so many ways, and people are starting to see that. Now, you are always going to have marches, and I guess the march was a lot smaller than it was [DATE]... But do you agree with their basic principles, which are gender equality and safety. When it comes to safety, women want to feel safe, particularly in the work place. Do you sign up to that? I do, but I also think they want to feel safe at the border. I think they do not want people pouring into their country. I think they want to see our military get much stronger. I mean women, you know, families, they want to see strength at the border. They want to see a strong law enforcement. I am a very much law and order person and candidate when I ran. The uniformed services, the military - there is nobody better than me on the military. I have increased the budget, we are going to have a budget, [MONEY] [DATE]. The [NORP] were not going to have anywhere near that. I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home in many different respects... A lot of the women I spoke to about this, they said it would be great to hear [INTERVIEWED], given some of the more disrespectful things that have been out there, and the way you have spoken about women, would you acknowledge that you had said things that perhaps you would not say now? That you have also listened - as many men are listening right now - that you have changed, you have changed as a man? Well I think we have to evolve. If we do not evolve, there is something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women, and I think you know that very well because you know me, and you have spent a long period of time with me. You see all of the women I have working around me and working with me. Tremendous respect for women. You have a lot of strong women around you. [PERSON], and your team here, the press team. Do you identify as a feminist? Are you a feminist? No, I would not say I am a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I am for women, I am for men, I am for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it and they have to win... And women are doing great. And I am happy about that. Move to [GPE]. A lot of stuff has been going on between you and my country, which has been... I think it is good. I think I am very popular in your country. Let us not be too hasty [INTERVIEWED]. But I believe that, I really do. I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I am saying about many different things. I have a great... I own the great Turnberry and other things in your country - [ORG] in [GPE] - and I am getting tremendous - I mean we get tremendous support from people in the [GPE]. But there are a lot of politicians, mainly the opposition politicians - [PERSON], [NORP] Leader, [PERSON], [GPE] Mayor... I do not know the man, I do not know the man. They want you banned. They do not want you to come on any kind of visit, a normal visit, state visit, anything. Well, that is their problem. I mean, if they do not , I could very nicely stay home. But I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister, who I just left. And I think she is been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we do not . I support her. I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. I mean, we will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. But I am a tremendous supporter of the [GPE]. Tremendous supporter. There is nobody that believes more strongly. You are [NORP] right? Well, my mother was born in [GPE], in the Hebrides. That makes you half-[NORP]. My mother was born in [GPE]. You know what they call that? Serious [GPE], right? That is serious [GPE]. She was born in [GPE]. Do you feel [NORP]? I sort of do. I love the country. I am in [GPE] with a tremendous... I also have a great situation over in [GPE] in [GPE] over there. And of course [ORG]... that is the Mona Lisa, [CARDINAL] of the great [PERSON] of the world in terms of sport and golf, and I own [ORG]. And I love the [GPE]. I have a special - maybe because it is my mother, who I thought was one of the great people I have ever known... What would she have made of what is happened to you, your mother? She would have... you know she had a great sense of regal. She had a great sense of... She had a love for the Queen. She had a love for the Royal Family. She really respected the Queen. And she loved the pomp and ceremony - and circumstance - but she loved the ceremony. The fact is, she loved the [GPE]... She would have loved you to get a state visit, right? Well, she would go back [DATE] to [GPE]. She just thought it was incredible. You know, she came over here when she was [DATE], she came over to [GPE] when she was [DATE]. She met my father very... it was not a long time. They got married, they were married [DATE] and they had a great marriage. You know, she was a terrific woman, and maybe that is ... and again she loved [GPE] and maybe that is one of the reasons that I feel the same way... Do you feel sad that neither of your parents ever got to see their son become [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]? Well, I do, but they are seen me have great success, because I have had great success. And you know, I have been successful even if you talk about, I do a show on television. They always turn out... very rarely does a show become a big hit like I had. I go into that, the real estate... I have had a lot of hits. So they got to see a lot, but there is nothing like what happened here. I mean, the presidency is something special, but more importantly, I am so happy with the results, because if you look at what is going on, and you look at our country, and you look at the way it is thriving. We are having a stock market like just about they have never had before. Ever before. We have picked up... [PERSON], we have picked up [MONEY] in value during the course of [DATE]... I just want to pick you up on [CARDINAL] thing about the reaction in [GPE]. Because a lot of people do not like you in [GPE], fuelled by these politicians, fuelled by some of the more inflammatory things you have said. The [CARDINAL] particular thing, because I want to try and just clarify with you - you retweeted an organisation called [ORG], [CARDINAL] of the leaders, [CARDINAL] times. And this caused... Well, [CARDINAL] times - boom boom boom. This caused huge anxiety and anger in my country, because [ORG] is basically bunch of racists, fascists... Of course, I did not know that. Well, that is what I wanted to clarify with you. What did you know about them when you did those tweets? Well, I know nothing about them, and I know nothing about them [DATE] other than I read a little bit, and I guess - and again, I am in [GPE], so I do not read as much about it. Perhaps it was a bit story in [GPE], perhaps it was a big story in the [GPE], but in [GPE] it was not a big story. I did a retweet. You know, a retweet sometimes you do... When you do your own tweeting or you do your own social media, it is fine. When you do those retweets, they can cause problems, because you never know who is doing it to start off with. The way it was interpreted - you did not take those down retweets for [DATE] - the way it was interpreted was, you were effectively endorsing this bunch of racists, and that caused a lot of anger. Well, I do not know who they are. I know nothing about them, so I would not be doing that. And I am as I say often, I am the least racist person that anybody's going to meet. And certainly I was not endorsing anybody. I knew nothing about them. They had a, I guess, a couple of depictions of radical [NORP] terror. Radical [NORP] terror, whether you like talking about it or not [PERSON], is... No, I am going to come and talk about it. ...Because you look at what is going on, you look at what is going on in the [GPE], you look at what is going on all over the world... And you are absolutely right about that. So you can try and shield it and say... I am not shielding anything. I do just want to get [CARDINAL] thing out of you. Go ahead. Given the amount of offence it caused, and given that you have now acknowledged that you did not know who these people were - they have had their accounts suspended by [ORG] - do you regret now those retweets and do you wish you, with hindsight, had not done it? Well, you know, look. It was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical [NORP] terror. This was a depiction of radical [NORP] terror. They were unverified videos. [CARDINAL] of them was not what it seemed. But this was... I did not do it, I did not go out and... I did a retweet. It was a big story where you are, but it was not a big story where I am. I get that, I get that. So you are telling me something... This is airing in [GPE], and I want them to get to the real you. Well, I tell you, the real me is someone who loves [GPE], who loves the [GPE], who loves... I love [GPE]. I wish... You know, one of the biggest problems I have in winning - I will not be able to get back there so often. I would love to go there, as you know before this happened, I would be there a lot. Very special people and a very special place. So I do not want to cause any difficulty for your country, that I can tell you. Can I get an apology out of you just for the retweets of [ORG]? If you are telling me they are ... I think it would go a long way. Here is what is fair. If you are telling me these are horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that. I know nothing about them. And you would disavow yourself of people like that? I do not want to be involved with people, but you are telling me about these people, because I know nothing about these people. Thank you [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. It means a lot to people in [GPE]. On the issue of trade, you were very encouraging when you met [PERSON]. And [PERSON] came over to [GPE] just before the [ORG] referendum and said if we voted to Leave, we'd go to the back of the queue. What is your position now? Are we at the front of the queue for a new trade deal with [GPE]? So we are going to make a deal with the [GPE], that will be great. As you know, somewhat restricted. Because of Brexit you have a [DATE] restriction. And when that restriction is up we are going to be your great trading partner. It is a tough restriction to have. You know for [DATE], you have very strong lack of being able to do things. [How come you called the referendum result correctly?] Because I know the [NORP] people and I understand the [NORP] people, and the [NORP] people wanted to have control over their country. And they do not want to have people coming from all over the world into [GPE] and they do not know anything about these people. And I said because of immigration, and to a certain extent because of trade, but mostly immigration, I said that [GPE] is going to be a big upset and I was right. And now we have seen how it is played out. Do you believe that we are in a good position in [GPE]? A lot of people are still very nervous, very anxious, but hearing [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] saying 'There is plenty of good trade coming from me' - that is a big deal to people in [GPE]. Well, would it be the way I negotiate? No, I would not negotiate the way it was negotiated. But I have a lot of respect for your Prime Minister, and I think they are doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude. What would you have done? I think I would have said that [ORG] is not cracked up to what it is supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out... I have a lot of problems with [ORG]. Yeah. You have done business with them. They are very... no, it is not a question of doing business. But I will tell you, representing [GPE], it is a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in. It is very very tough. And yet they send their product to us - no taxes, very little taxes, it is very unfair. I have had a lot of problems with [ORG], and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. [ORG] has treated [GPE] very unfairly when it came to trade. They are not the only ones by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But [ORG] has been very very unfair to [GPE], and I think it'll turn out to be very much to their detriment. So are we front of the queue? Or are we behind the [NORP]? Because we are a bit worried about [PERSON] who is been all over you trying to be your new best friend. No, I like him. He is a friend of mine. [PERSON]! He is a great guy, his wife is fantastic. I like him a lot. You know, we had dinner at the top of [FAC]. Well he rolled out the red carpet!... My irritation with my country. We have given state visits to [PERSON], to [PERSON], to [PERSON] and to [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. So the implication from them trying to ban you, is that somehow you are worse than they are. Well I had not heard about banning, but I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for. And I do stand for tough borders. I am going to come to that now, but to those who do not , what do you say to them? I do not care, I do not care. It is just one of those things. I do not say anything. You know why? Because I do not care. Let us turn to security, national security. You have been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer [ORG] hard. [ORG] is now out of [GPE] and [GPE]. I mean, that is a big double success for you, right? By the way, we would have never been there with the previous administration. Are we winning the war..? And I have to say this. With the economy, had the previous administration in its own form, in a different form, or let us put it, had the [NORP] won - instead of being [PERCENT] up, they would have been [PERCENT] down, because [GPE] was heading in a very bad direction. Yeah, we have done very well in [GPE], we have done very well in [GPE], we have hammered them. But they spread. They go all over. It is not a good situation, and nobody knows it better than the folks in the [GPE]. You have had some tough bouts. A lot of [NORP] think you hate them. That you hate [NORP]. No, totally false. No, that is false. Clarify what you feel about that. I feel love for all people, but if a person's bad, we have got to do something about it. There is got to be retribution. But I have had great great relationships with [NORP], and I had good support from [NORP] during my [INTERVIEWED]ial run. And I think I have good support right now. You know, it is interesting. They want to be safe also, [PERSON]. And they like me because I give them security. I have a great relationship and respect for [NORP]. [CARDINAL] people were killed in [NORP] by [NORP] terrorism in [DATE]. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed [CARDINAL]. There was another mass shooting in a school [DATE] in [GPE] - the 12th [DATE] alone. [CARDINAL] of the worst mass shootings in [NORP] history have happened on your watch, in [GPE] and at the church in [GPE]. People will be saying you are very tough on security, you want to keep [NORP] safe, but if you do not do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep [GPE] safe. I am a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at [GPE], where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by [CARDINAL] for a long time, they just killed and [CARDINAL] of people wounded to [DATE] still in the hospitals. That was one of the worst. And you have had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you would not have had [CARDINAL] of people killed... By the way, you have many of those. You look at [GPE], [GPE]. These guys walk in - the people that they knew - they walk in and they start [CARDINAL] by [CARDINAL] shooting them. They had no chance. But here is the difference... [PERSON], they had no chance. OK, but let me give you the other side of this coin. I come from a country with very few guns. We have [CARDINAL] deaths a year. In [GPE], [DATE]... You have a lot of terrorism. Right. That is separate to it, but on the gun issue. Let me just put this to you. The [GPE] shooter, [PERSON], he bought [CARDINAL] guns legally in [DATE] prior to his rampage, including [CARDINAL] AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, which he then equipped with bump stocks, which effectively converted them into machine guns, which are illegal. And he rained bullets down on [CARDINAL] 000 people in [GPE]. I remember it very well. It was terrible. Why has nothing been done to stop somebody doing that again? We do have gun control laws, and this sick person - he was a sicko. I mean that is the big problem, there is sick people. If he did not have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else. But he had [CARDINAL] guns. The point is he would have had [CARDINAL] bombs. He would have had [CARDINAL] of something else. Why cannot you make it difficult for him? You know, it is an argument that people have... I have heard it every different way and we can go around this argument. I am a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security. I think it would be far worse. I think you need it for security. But again, you have had so many attacks where there was only a gun - a bad person's gun - going in this direction, and if you had one on the other side - so many. In fact, that is a very big example. And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would have saved a lot of lives. So I get what you are saying, but I believe in the Second Amendment. Quick fire - climate change. For you, is it about the science or is it about the money? The Paris Accords. I think it is about everything and I am a believer in clean air and clear water. The Paris Accord for us would have been a disaster... Are you completely out of that? I am completely out of it. No way back? There could be a way back. First of all, it was a terrible deal for [GPE]. If they made a good deal, like if they made a good deal with [ORG] - you know, having to do with trade - there is always a chance we'd get back, but it was a terrible deal for [GPE]. It was unfair to [GPE]. Do you believe in climate change? Do you believe it exists? There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look - it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. Right? Right. That was not working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they are setting records, so OK, they are at a record level. There were so many thing happening, [PERSON]. I will tell you what I believe in. I believe in clear air. I believe in crystal clear beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris Accord, if we could go back into the Paris Accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal, As usual, they took advantage of [GPE]. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like [PERSON]... No, no, I like [PERSON], I would love to, but it is got to be a good deal for [GPE]. Quick question on trophy hunting. You seemed to indicate that you have had a change of mind about this, or you'd like the administration to. I changed it. I did not want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks bought back into this. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they are saying, where money goes toward - well money in that case was going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I do not, I turned that order around. That was an order. I know you did. I was very pleased to see that. I turned that order around. I tweeted to congratulate you. Were you shocked? Were you shocked? I was surprised, but I also said to people you will listen to argument. And my problem with all the hysterical liberals who lie on the floor kicking and screaming all day long about you, if they actually tried to reason with you and argue with you, I noticed on that you indicated you'd changed your mind and you have now said you have... That was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. [DATE] even. Not even a day went by. No, I was not believing in conservation that... People will love to hear that. A question about your health. Everyone was being led to believe that you were insane, and physically incredibly unfit. It turned out from your recent medical that you are [CARDINAL] in your cognitive tests... Which most people are not going to do too well on. Right. You have got to hand it to you. As you said 'stable genius'. Your words. I am a stable genius. And healthy. You have never had a drink, you have never smoked, you have never taken drugs. We do see lots of pictures of you with burgers and Cokes and stuff. It is an unusual diet. Do not want to change that! No, they build that up. I eat fine food, I eat really... some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food. I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually when you are campaigning there is a lot of sense to it because it is boom boom boom. But no, I think I eat actually quite well. Have you got an invite to the royal wedding? Have I? Yeah. Not that I know of. Would you like to go? I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple. [PERSON] did say you were a divisive misogynist. Well, I still hope they are happy. I am going to make you happy, because your son [PERSON] is a massive fan of my football team in [GPE], [ORG]. That is true! And we saw pictures of him... he is an [ORG] fan. We have been going through a rough patch for a long period of time. People think it is time for a change of leadership at my club. [PERSON], I am sure, shares my view, right? I have something for you. I have done - this is an [ORG] shirt. He will be so happy. ...'[PERSON] [DATE]?. We are looking for a new leader who has an attacking philosophy, who believes in a strong defensive wall and believes in winning at all costs. And only wants big trophies. Well I think that is beautiful. You know I have a son who does love this sport. He loves this sport. And he loves [ORG], right? And it is growing very rapidly in [GPE]. Are you an [ORG] fan? Not particularly, no... Do not kill the dream [INTERVIEWED]! But I have a friend who owns [ORG] so I know exactly what I am going to do with it. Really? Wow! That will kill our special relationship! Anyway, that is for you, and if you do want to come and manage [ORG], we would love it. That is great! That is beautiful. We will do very well! [INTERVIEWED], it is been great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpolishjournalists", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me say at the outset of this interview that this visit is in no way intended to complicate the situation there -- rather to show [NORP] interest in [GPE], to support the general desire that we feel for [GPE] to have improved relations with [GPE] and with the West in general. It is, obviously, as I will in every country -- give me a chance to give our views freely and openly about freedom and things of that nature, but it is not a visit that is trying to complicate matters between [GPE] and [GPE], or anything else. It is in keeping with my view that Europe should be whole and free, and in saluting the changes that have taken place, and hopefully in contributing to [GPE]'s quest for more democracy and economic reform. So, we are going in a constructive vein, not in some critical vein or not in some mode of trying to complicate things for somebody else. [INTERVIEWED]'s Visit to [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], this group here -- the composition of this group is actually a testimony to the progress of pluralism, because we have [ORG] here on the Government's side. Yes, and is not it, [INTERVIEWED], very interesting that you were in [GPE] [DATE], and now you are going to [GPE] again? Is there any particular reason that you make the second trip in such a short time? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, in the first visit, we had an opportunity to meet with Mr. [PERSON] [[ORG] leader], and certainly I was accorded wonderful hospitality by General [PERSON] [Chairman of [GPE]'s [ORG]]. At that time, as you point out, [PERSON], there was no real communication between [ORG] and the leadership. And again, I, in that visit, did not try to involve myself in the internal affairs of [GPE]. But by being there, and by being permitted to speak on the television and say what was in my heart, and able to meet with [PERSON] -- I mean, with [PERSON], even though [NORP] was then outlawed, it opened up for us a strong feeling for [GPE], and you could sense the indications of change. And now there has been change; there has been an evolution in these relationships. And so, it is appropriate that we go back and talk respectfully to the leaders about their aspirations for economic reform, my aspirations for an era of what we call in our East-West relations beyond containment, and in terms of the evolution of -- the moving of countries toward the West as much as they feel comfortable with. So, it is a visit that makes sense because things are evolving, things are moving in the direction that we salute. And also, going there as [ORG] [INTERVIEWED], I am sure, is quite different than being [INTERVIEWED]. There is [CARDINAL] [INTERVIEWED], and true, there is [CARDINAL] Vice [INTERVIEWED]. But that is not seen the same as the [INTERVIEWED] going there to say how much an evolving relationship means to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. So, let me ask maybe more precisely, [INTERVIEWED], what would you tell [ORG] about the [NORP] attitude toward our efforts to achieve self-determination, about all those free elections which took place recently in [GPE], about our achievements in gaining free speech and the restoration of our free will in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'd simply say the visit is a symbol of our support for [GPE] as it moves toward greater democracy. And I had a chance to make that point [DATE] and will make it again. So, it is symbolic. I will state that we are encouraged by changes. I will try not to look like I am fine-tuning the internal affairs of [GPE]. I am not going to do that, but I think I have every right to say I am encouraged by the changes we have seen. Obviously, we followed the roundtable discussions and agreement, and salute that agreement. As you know, we are committed to representation by the people, of the people. And so, we see changes in the way elected representatives are chosen and go forward to represent their people -- we salute that. So, it will be in this vein, this thematic vein, that I will be talking. And in [GPE], you know, there is an historic opportunity now to help end the postwar division of Europe. I mean, Europe has been divided. And if we handle ourselves correctly with [GPE] and if the changes continue that we are seeing, we could see a Europe that is freer and more whole. [INTERVIEWER]. That is what you said in [DATE] in [GPE] in your -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, and I talked about differentiation there. And, indeed, that [GPE] trip led to my feeling very comfortable going with a similar message to [GPE]. So, it is evolutionary here. Foreign Troops Deployed in Europe [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], already during [TIME] of this interview, you used, several times, the word change, because everybody now sees the changes taking place in [GPE]. For some, the changes are too slow; for some, are too quick. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. But as a very experienced politician, you certainly know that good policy requires not only change but also some elements of stability that prevent the change from erupting, from being blown up and leading to some kind of a deep crisis. Would you like to comment about what elements of continuity in central and Eastern Europe would you like to see? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'd like to see respect for the will of the people. And I think as we -- I do not want to -- well, let me start over. I will stand by that, obviously, but I would like to see -- very candidly -- I'd like to see [NORP] troops -- we are talking about [GPE] now -- out. I do not think anyone, anymore, thinks that there is a danger of invasion from the West into [GPE], for example. And I would like to see a continuation of the change that would result in the [NORP] feeling comfortable in taking their troops out of there. Having said that, I will not be trying to inflame change so that it does what you are talking about. The people seem to be handling it very nicely now, with elections and with discussions around a table. And I do not want to do something that would inadvertently do what you are talking about, or that you asked about; and that is, to have some crisis that will compel other answers. And I do not want that, and I am not going to deliberately do anything that is going to cause a crisis. I am going to feel free to speak out about -- as I did right now at [FAC] -- about what we hold dear and what [NORP] think and what we want to see about a freer, a more whole Europe. And so, I think we can do this, [PERSON], without exacerbating tensions that I know exist in [GPE]. We are realistic; we know there are tensions still. [INTERVIEWER]. But this shall mean that -- are you in favor of withdrawing foreign troops from all Europe, from all countries? [INTERVIEWED]. I would like to see the start be withdrawing of the troops from [GPE], because I think there is no danger at all of an invasion of [GPE] from the West. And I do not think anybody in [GPE] thinks there is a danger of invasion of [GPE] from the West. But what I will do, in answer to your question, is to press forward with a very bold plan that we have laid on the table at [ORG] which substantially reduces [GPE] and [NORP] troops deployed outside their borders, and that sends a good signal. And then we go for whatever the next step might be; but as long as we have this tremendous disparity in [NORP]-deployed troops or bloc troops versus [ORG] troops, it is pretty hard to visualize eliminating all troops. But I think we are on the right track, and we are on the right step here. And so, we will go down that road. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], let me go back to your coming back to [GPE], if I may. In [DATE] you had a chance to talk to General [PERSON], who is both the man who introduced martial law, but also the roundtable talks and the first honest elections since the Second World War. What are you expecting of your conversation, of your forthcoming conversation now, with the General? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, we have got a baseline. We have a point of departure, because with respect, he gave me probably a disproportionate amount of time. I was the [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]; he was the head of the whole country. And thus, I remember with sincerity what I thought was great courtesy to me. And through that courtesy, we had more than a passing conversation; we had a conversation about a lot of things that now have changed. We even had a chance to talk about [PERSON] with [PERSON], his knowing my view and his making very clear to me his view at the time. Now there is been an evolution of views. And what I think we ought to do is pick up from where we started and then say: All right, we have come along here. We want to help you in an economic sense. Some of that will not be easy, because the concept of reform -- economic reform -- to get full cooperation from these international institutions, monetary institutions, is essential. And I expect he will be saying, I have tried to make reforms, and do not push me too far on all this. And I will understand that, but I will say: Please understand my position. We want to help you with OPIC; we want to help you with privatization; we want to help you in the international institutions and with special trade benefits. But we need to know that you are going to be able to not only continue existing reforms but expand on reforms so that the economic system that works will be given a chance to work unfettered. And that is a big key, and that is not easy for a lot of regimes all around the world. It is not just [GPE] and [GPE] and Eastern Europe; it is many countries. And so, I know that what I will be talking about will not be easy for the regime to accommodate or, indeed, even for those who have been in opposition. And I am talking now about newly elected people, too. But I think I owe the people with whom I meet our honest assessment, and I owe them my frank view of what we can do, and what it is going to take for us to be able to do it in terms of economic support. [INTERVIEWER]. Just pressing this a bit, [INTERVIEWED], will you intend to set any specific conditions for the [GPE] aid to [GPE], and would you like to have control over implementing such conditions, if any? [INTERVIEWED]. Not control -- we cannot try to control the internal affairs of another country -- but we have got to be clear that to get the kind of financial support from the outside world and the kind of private investment that I think can be enormously helpful, that certain reforms must go forward. But I am not going there in an arrogant mode, trying to say we have got all the answers. I mean, he might turn around and ask me about our debt -- [laughter] -- and then I'd be embarrassed. [INTERVIEWER]. I have, [INTERVIEWED] -- -- [INTERVIEWED]. In fact, he might; and if he did, that would be fine. I will tell him what we are trying to do about it. And one of the things we are trying to do about it is to live within our means, and that gives us less money available to do many of the things I'd like to be doing around the world, you know. So, then we are kind of on a catch-22 on that one. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. I sometimes get the impression that both sides, [GPE] and the Western alliance countries, are expecting too much from each other. The West is expecting from us to change the system, to change the economic system, to introduce pluralistic democracy and, at the same time, to preserve the necessary level of stability and prevent the country from collapse. On the other hand, our country expects from the West such a significant assistance that would make all these changes possible to happen in a country which is so heavily indebted and its economy is in such a mess. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think you raise a very interesting point -- and very carefully phrased, I noticed. But that is why I keep saying I do not want to exacerbate tensions. I do not want to make competing forces move apart inadvertently. I do not want to say something that would complicate the move that is taking place towards democratization and economic reform. I feel confident enough that both of those things are necessary for [GPE] -- for [NORP] to enjoy the freedoms that I think most [NORP] aspire to. But I am not going to say hey, you have got to have a [ORG] with [CARDINAL] people and a [ORG] with [CARDINAL] and a [INTERVIEWED] and a [ORG] [INTERVIEWED] and [CARDINAL] States. I mean, that is our system. But I am going to say we have got common thoughts here. I think of the [NORP] people as treasuring freedom. I think of them fighting -- having a tough go there in World War II and standing up to the hordes that finally just were too much. I think of the patriotism of [GPE]. I think of the affection that [NORP] of [NORP] heritage have for [GPE]. And I'd like to try to have the interlocutors, the people I talk to -- whether they are labor or whether they are in the regime -- understand that we want to help and that we do admire the changes that have taken place, and not put it into a great East-West mode all the time. We have problems. I am keeping my eyes open, but we are going to try to improve relations with [GPE]. But I cannot look at these outrageous differences in conventional forces, for example, and then say to everybody in [GPE], hey, we do not need to be concerned about [NORP] intentions. They are modernizing their intercontinental stuff, their nuclear weapons. They have got disproportionate advantage in conventional forces. And so, I am not going to be naive in suggesting that we have no differences between us, as it relates to [GPE]. And when [PERSON] talks about a [NORP] house, we say, yes, but let all the doors be open; let it be done so people can move from room to room in that house -- and that should not antagonize anybody. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you have been known as a conciliator, as a consensus-builder, as an adversary of extreme solutions. Can we write that [PERSON], the [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE], is unequivocally in favor of an evolutionary change in [GPE] without outbursts, without breaking down of the dialog among the different social forces? Can we write that? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, you can write it. I do not want you to write it in such a way that I seem to discourage those who may have differences. In other words, I do not want to discourage those that have felt out and are trying to get in, those who did not participate over [DATE] in elections and are now able to participate. I do not want to endorse the status quo -- I mean, that is not my role. Nor do I want to do what you are talking about, that your question asked about, which is exacerbate tensions. What I want to do is say, Here is what we stand for. Here is what [GPE] stands for; and here are our aspirations for a relationship with [GPE], which obviously is the superpower there. And here are my aspirations for [GPE] that come from my heart, because I can feel it strongly -- how those who came to our country from this country feel about their homeland. And I'd leave it there, [PERSON], rather than try to endorse the status quo. But I have to exhort and encourage as much economic reform as possible, as much political freedom as possible. And if I do not do that, I will not be leveling with the [NORP] people, and I will not be being a good [INTERVIEWED] for my own -- for [GPE]. So, I do not think it is as delicate as perhaps before, but I -- and it is important. You see, I have no hangups when [PERSON] goes to [GPE] or [GPE] -- fine, let him go. The better hand he gets and the better he is received there -- they are saying, [PERSON]! Keep it up! Keep what up? Keep reforming up; keep changing up. Who would have thought you'd hear lively debates in their own political process [DATE]? So, it does not bother me as [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] that he gets a good standing on the applause meters over there in Western Europe. Nor should it bother him when I take this message of freedom and democracy to Eastern Europe. In my view, that does not come under the heading of his business, just as it does not come under the heading of mine if he goes to [GPE] or [GPE]. And so, it is in that vein I go to -- not competitively. Saying you want [CARDINAL] house? Fine. Let us get all the rooms open so we can all move around in there. And let us find out what works in the economy, what works in terms of free unions, what works in terms of free politics. And we think we can speak to that because we have had some success. We are not saying we have no problems in [GPE], but in these things -- moving around, freedom to say what you think, freedom to form a union, freedom to have a voice in the politics by the people -- we think we know what we are talking about there. We want to share it with you. So, it is in that spirit that we will be going. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I think that [PERSON] has [CARDINAL] personal question for you. Just [CARDINAL]. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], last question of a little personal character. If you were a young [NORP], would you now queue in front of an [NORP] consulate to emigrate to [GPE], or would you rather stay in [GPE] and fight the difficult fight there? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not know what a young [NORP] would be thinking, but what I think -- what I'd like to think he'd be thinking -- is, look, I am living in a time of dynamic change. This is the time of most hope for my country in a long, long time. And I want to be a part of it, and I want to participate. I want to run for election; I want to join a free association; I want to be a part of a government to bring economic relief to my people. And I want to see [GPE] appreciated around the world -- its art, its culture, its heroism. And I want -- I, young guy [PERSON], whatever my name is, at [DATE] -- I want to be a part of this. And that is the way I'd like to do it -- that is the way I would hope that some young kid could look at it. Now, maybe that is a little much, because in economically difficult times, people kind of think, hey, the grass looks a little greener over there; the ocean does not look quite so wide. If I could just make it to [GPE], maybe I could do something. But even if he makes it to [GPE], he is got to have, beating in his heart, the love of his homeland. And so, I would hope that most would say, look, I want to be a part of the change that I feel in the air, you see. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you all.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpolishjournalists0", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. I am looking forward to our state dinner. It is a chance for me to, on a personal level, repay the favor of my friend [PERSON] for his great hospitality to [PERSON] and me when we visited he and [PERSON] there in [GPE]. Secondly, it is a chance to say to our country and the world how important our relations are with [GPE]. We really think-respect the [NORP] people. We have got great numbers of [NORP] who still love the motherland. And it is going to be a wonderful occasion to build on a great relationship, make it even better. We will discuss a lot of topics. We will talk about the war on terror. [GPE] has been a great friend and supporter, member of the coalition on the war against terror. We have got troops in the-on ships off the Indian Ocean. We have got engineers in [GPE], shared intelligence. [PERSON] has been a strong friend and supporter. I am confident he will want to talk about [ORG] expansion. Perhaps I will leave that for a question. But all in all, we have got great relations, and I look forward to having a good conversation with a leader I respect. And I respect [PERSON]. Why do not we start with you, sir. Democracy in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED], about your talks with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] [DATE], [GPE] has been viewed by your administration as one of the most successful examples of democratic transformation. However, the current [NORP] Government is taking some steps and adopting some laws which would obviously limit independence of media and central bank, which are the pillars of democracy. So are you going to raise these issues with the [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I have got faith that a democracy will work. And I am confident that [ORG] and the [NORP] people will come up with the right answers to issues relating to any law. I will-of course, if he asks my opinion, I will remind him that an independent media is a very important part of democracy. It is one of the pillars of democracy. I value our media, as an aside, saying that of course to pander to the people here that cover me on a [DATE] basis. [Laughter] But I do value a free and open media, and I think it is an incredibly important part. But your opening statement was true. We value the progress that [GPE] has made and the example [GPE] has set in a neighborhood that was a pretty tough neighborhood for awhile. And I was most impressed, when I went to [GPE], to see the spirit of the people and the optimism. I understand the country is going through tough times, but all countries go through tough times. [INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to [GPE], [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you are taking [PERSON]-it was your decision to go to [GPE], [GPE], to meet with [NORP]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, we are. [INTERVIEWER]. What is the reason for that meeting, and if you could tell us, what is your message to [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the message to [NORP] is, I respect and honor the [NORP] traditions and [NORP] heritage. Actually, there was a-even in my own State of [GPE], there is a community or [CARDINAL] that [NORP] have settled in [GPE] and still retains many of the great traditions and heritages. It also reminds people that even though they have got a [NORP] heritage and embraced [NORP] traditions, they are [NORP]. It is a great part of the [NORP] experience. We envelop and welcome people from all walks of life. That in itself is an important statement to constantly make in our country. It reminds people of the strength of the country. I have decided to go to [GPE], [GPE], because it is going to be a-I hope it is a fun trip for [PERSON]. I mean, I think it is important-I understand what a state dinner is like. It is formal. You will see; it is going to be [DATE]. They arrive on [FAC]. The military will be there. There is a lot of pomp and circumstance. It is an exciting ceremony; it really is. And then there will be the formal dinners and the black tie, and the people will come, and the entertainment and the food-it is going to be great. But there is more to a good [NORP] experience than just a formal dinner. I try to wear a tuxedo as little as possible, I want you to know. But flying out there to [GPE], the heartland of the country, with our friend, is going to be great. And he is going to see a big, enthusiastic crowd. It will give him a chance to say some things. And I think that is important to provide him a forum, so that he can not only be seen in a tuxedo but be seen speaking his mind about whatever issue he wants to talk about to an [NORP] audience that is made up of people from his homeland that have now settled in our country. I think it is going to be a great event. To me, it helps complete the state dinner aspect of the trip. [GPE] Economy [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I talked to Mr. [PERSON] just before [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. How is he doing? [INTERVIEWER]. Great. He looks good, in good shape. [INTERVIEWED]. Looking forward to a 3mile run? [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. He told me that one of the topics he would like to touch on is the recent financial scandals in the [GPE], because they are a kind of backlash on Central Europe, and the recovery is difficult. And there is this feeling outgoing that [ORG] is not doing enough to change its own rules to really prevent the backlash for [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I will explain to him we are doing things, and I will be glad to lay out the initiative I talked about- and have been talking about, by the way, since [DATE] and [DATE] and then the speech I gave in [GPE]. And of course, our [ORG] has acted-[ORG] acted, and the [ORG] has acted. And if he looks at what I proposed and what the [ORG] has proposed and what the [ORG] proposed, there is not much difference. And in other words, the point is that a bill will come out that will hold people accountable for accounting error-accounting fraud and, as we go forward, hopefully set an example-make it clear to people, there will be a consequence if they continue to do that. There are markets-[CARDINAL] things affect our markets, I will explain to [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] of course is confidence and the numbers, and we are addressing that. Secondly is the war on terror. People are still-you know, realize that [GPE] is still a target. And the [NORP] people know that we are doing everything we can to protect the homeland and run down these killers wherever they try to hide. And that is all they are, by the way, just nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers. And thirdly, the corporate sector-the profits are beginning to improve, but the price-earnings multiples- in other words, the price of a share relative to its earnings-was very high, and the market is adjusting. So all [CARDINAL] of those factors are important. And obviously we-that is not the whole picture of our economy, and that is what [PERSON] has got to understand. The market reflects part of it, but our unemployment rate is-looks like it is steady. It has stopped rising. As a matter of fact, it had a drop, and it is level. Our consumer spending numbers are up. Our manufacturing orders are increasing. In other words, the recovery is beginning to show some strength. So therefore, what I am going to ask him is to look at the entire picture. Finally, we have got good monetary policy and good fiscal policy here in [GPE], and that in itself is part of long-term recovery. And so he will hear a man who is-recognizes that we are making some progress. We have got to do more, but I am pleased to report to him that I think things are going to get better. The foundation for long-term growth has been-is in place. War on Terrorism [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I wanted to ask you a question about the war against terrorism. The [NORP] seem to less and less support the war against terrorism. And I wonder if you could explain to us, why do you think it is happening, and if you are ready to go alone on this next phase of the war, whatever the phase is? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I do not feel that the support from Europe is lessening. As a matter of fact, I have just come from a [ORG] meeting in [GPE] where, to a person, they were very supportive of our war on terror, because the [NORP] recognize that the terrorists could strike them just as easy as they could strike us. We have still got great intelligence sharing amongst our nations. We have got good police action. We have hauled in- we being the coalition- has hauled in-that means arrest-2, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] terrorists. So we are picking them off, [CARDINAL] by [CARDINAL]. This is a different kind of war. I use every chance I get, when I speak to the [NORP] people, to explain why this is different. And so-as opposed to destroying lines of tanks or shooting down airplanes, success is measured by-[CARDINAL] by [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] person at a time. And the [NORP] leaders understand that, and they have been very supportive. They still-I think we have got [CARDINAL] 000 troops in [GPE]-we do, in the [NORP] theater, and there is [CARDINAL] 000 troops from other nations there as well. So it is a firm commitment. I will continue to communicate and consult with our friends and allies as to every stage of the war, as the battlefront shifts. By the way, the battlefront is not shifting out of [GPE]. We are there. We will remain there. We have got a lot of work to do there. There is still [ORG] killers there. And of course we will need to continue to have deliberations with our friends and allies, and we will have them for future theaters and different operations. We talk to them all the time. [GPE]'s Purchase of New Fighter Jets [INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of war, [INTERVIEWED], [GPE] is going to buy new fighter planes-- [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I understand that is the case. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. And the F-16s are one of the-- [INTERVIEWED]. I have got a suggestion for them. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. However, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] [DATE]-you kind of-was kind of complaining that maybe the [NORP] offer is not meeting enough-expectations. So is-- [INTERVIEWED]. He is negotiating in public. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. Is your administration in any way going to support [GPE] companies to win the standard-- [INTERVIEWED]. We will offer a fabulous product-- [INTERVIEWER]. Fabulous product. [INTERVIEWED]. --called the F-16. And we will work with our friends to make- you know, to compete on an above-board basis, totally above-board. And you know, we hope the [NORP] Government picks quality. If they do, they will, of course, come our way. But that is up to the Government. [PERSON] will be and the Government of [GPE] will-you know, we will respect the process and respect the country and appreciate it is a tough decision and hope they make the right decision as far as we are concerned. But that-- Future Role of NATO [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you think that the [ORG] will play as important role for [GPE] in [DATE] as it played in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. And do you think it is possible that [GPE] [DATE] will become [ORG] member? [INTERVIEWED]. Interesting question. First, I do think [ORG] is very important. It is obviously a different role. [ORG] served as kind of a bulwark in defense against [NORP] tanks storming across the [NORP] Continent. [DATE] are over. [GPE] is no longer the enemy. I witnessed the fact that not only have we got good relations with [GPE], but the very same trip that I-when I went to [GPE] to sign this treaty that literally redefined our relationship from one of distrust and-like it was during the cold war, to a new relationship, shortly thereafter we went to [GPE] and welcomed a new relationship between [ORG] and [GPE]. So the whole relationship has changed for the better. [ORG] has-and I think it is going to be very hard-very important to work that relationship with [GPE], to allow for the- the new relationship to develop and mature. And I think it will in a very positive way. The new relationship-the new role of [ORG] is-really needs to adjust to the new realities of [DATE], and that is how to best fight the war on terror. And that means a different configuration of the use of our forces and the use of assets. Our forces need to be lighter and quicker to strike, and elite units need to be prepared to move at a moment's notice. The enemy has changed, and the battlefield, the nature of the battlefield has changed. And therefore, the [ORG] mission must remain the same, mutual defense. But its tactics must change. And I think [ORG] is very relevant, and we will be an active and engaged partner in [ORG]. Let me just-I will ask myself, Well, [INTERVIEWED], do you think we ought to expand? [Laughter] I gave a very important speech in [GPE]. It is interesting-I hope the people in the world that are interested in our opinion on subjects noted that the speech was in [GPE]. And the speech was about a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. And I talked about the expansion of [ORG], and I said that I am interested more rather than less. And at the same time, I urged the applicant countries to take nothing for granted, to work very hard up until [TIME] to show those of us in [ORG] that they will be willing and active and capable partners. And I look forward to our meeting in [GPE]. I fully understand the position of the [NORP] Government. I have had long discussions with [PERSON] on the subject of [ORG] expansion, and I think people know that I am forward-leaning, depending-if the member countries, you know, meet their MAP requirements. [NORP] and [GPE] Central Banks [INTERVIEWER]. I want to go back to the finances and the limit. There is an attempt in [GPE] to limit independence of central bank, so it would be more-be manipulated more by Government, so Government would have more influence over central bank. In the current situation, what is your feeling about this? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I do not know all the facts about how the [NORP] democracy is handling this particular situation. I can tell you, however, from my experience, that a central bank should be independent. And the independence of our central bank gives Chairman [PERSON] and the other Governors of [ORG] great credibility in our country, to know that decisions are being made apart from politics. And our central bank is a part of- is a very important part of our-has been and will continue to be a very important part of the economic vitality of our country. It also gives investors who look at our country great confidence to know that the monetary supplies be not based upon politics, but the decisions on monetary supplies will be based upon the vision of some very wise people. I think, when people look at how capital moves into countries, the independence of a central bank is an important part of attracting capital. And [GPE] needs to attract capital investment. If anybody were to ask me my advice on the central bank, that is what I would give. [INTERVIEWED]'s Popularity in Poland/[INTERVIEWED]'s Vacation [INTERVIEWER]. I'd like to ask you about different subject. According to the latest polls, you are the most popular foreign politician leader in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Really? I usually say I do not believe in polls, but I may have to change my mind. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. With the same approval rate as [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. And I want to ask you to comment on this, and-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, how high is it? [INTERVIEWER]. Would you be willing to visit [GPE] again? [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE]? [INTERVIEWER]. Why do not you go to [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Again? [INTERVIEWER]. On holiday. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks. I do not know what to say. I appreciate that. I am flattered. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you willing to spend a vacation in [GPE]? With your parents, obviously? [INTERVIEWED]. With my parents? I do not know if my mother could stand that. But listen, when I vacation, just kind of know about me, I like to be with my family, and I like to be in [GPE]. I just recently went to [GPE]. I'd love to go to [GPE], too, to be with my mother and dad. But my favorite vacation spot is my own ranch in the State I love. And I like to get out and fool around on the land, and it does not matter how hot it is or how cold it is. How hot it is and cold it is matters to those who have to follow me. For me, there is no day hot enough or cold enough. [Laughter] These poor souls-[PERSON] in [DATE]. That is my idea of vacation. Although I must say, I had a great time up with Mother and Dad [DATE], and I love to be around them as well. But [DATE], I am going to go down to [GPE] and actually work out of [GPE]. I am going to travel quite a bit. After all, we are getting into the political season here in [GPE]. We have got our elections in [DATE]. [DATE] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], we talk a lot about how September 11th changed the world, changed [GPE]. Has it changed you? [INTERVIEWED]. Changed me? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. I do not think a single event can change anybody's basic values. It obviously changed the fact that I knew that my time as the [INTERVIEWED] would be dedicated to winning the war on terror and protecting our homeland. This is-I keep telling people this-it is just a different type of war, because much of the movement of the enemy is invisible to the [NORP] people and/or to the world. And yet we know they are there. The killers on [DATE] had been in our country for a period of time. They behaved normally. They looked normal. They, you know, were nonthreatening. It was hard to tell that they were part of this unbelievably evil plot. And it-we are concerned that another group are here or somewhere, not only here but in other countries in Europe. And so the task is an all-consuming task of protecting our homeland and making sure we do everything we can here to find out if anybody is here and who they are and disrupt their plans and, at the same time, hunt down their leaders. The wars of the past had known battlefields, and it was clear that such-and-such had to happen. There had to be an invasion in order to achieve this or that. This is a hunt for individuals. We are chasing down [CARDINAL] person at a time. They were foolishly collected up at [CARDINAL] point in time in the Shahi-Kot Mountains, and it was a tough chore. But our brave soldiers, along with coalition soldiers, were able to go in and score great success at bringing them to justice, as I like to put it. They are wise to our ways. They realize we are a heck of a lot tougher than they thought. They assumed [GPE] was a weak country, that we did not really believe anything. And they are finding out that is not the way we think. And so I realized after 9/11, after I got over the grief, along with everybody else in our country, that this was a long, very important struggle. And the struggle goes beyond just fighting an [ORG]-type network. I have deep concerns about the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction, and so should you, so should anybody who loves freedom, because there are nations in the world developing these weapons who hate freedom, leaders hate freedom. And what we cannot allow happen is these nations to develop these weapons and then blackmail us and/or use them. We will have-a judgment will have missed history's call to freedom. And so I realize that this war is going to consume a lot of my time. On the other hand, these members of the press know that I am optimistic person who truly believes that we can achieve some positive things out of the evil done to the country and to the world. So when I talk to our friends, like [PERSON] and others, I remind them of this call. We are leaders in a significant moment in history, and we cannot blink, and we cannot -we must be determined and focused to achieve this important objective, which is peace for our children, is what we are really fighting for, civilization. Yes, ma'am. Free Trade [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you always said that you are supporter of removing the trade barriers. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Why do you think there are so many of them still exist? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, because I think the temptation is to be protectionist. And it is easier to mollify constituencies with protectionist rhetoric. [GPE] suffers from protectionist policies in parts of Europe, as you know. I am a strong believer in free trade. I want the [ORG] to give me what is called trade promotion authority. I will exercise that diligently to open up markets. On the other hand, I have an obligation to enforce law. And so I recently said that the-I listened to an [ORG] ruling on steel. The [ORG] ruled that excessive steel imports were affecting our industry in a negative way. I put a temporary measure in place, which exempted, by the way, [GPE]. And that was a chance for the steel industry, our own steel industry, to get on its feet. But nevertheless, as I reminded members of [ORG], this only represents a very small portion of the [MONEY] of trade we have [DATE]. But protectionism, for some, is a viable economic remedy. And in my judgment, protectionism would be bad for the world and bad for our country. We are opening up-we sent our man to [GPE] to commit to the next round of [ORG]. And unlike [GPE], where it all fell apart, we were able to- we being those of us in the world who support free trade-were able to move the process farther down the line. And I will continue to work for free trade. It is in our Nation's interests and the world's interests that we trade. It is in the developing world's interest that there be trade. And our country is-we have got what is called AGOA, agreement with the [NORP] countries. I am working on a free trade agreement with [NORP]. I'd like to see a free trade agreement from [GPE] all the way down to [GPE]. As I say, there is protectionist tendencies that occasionally rise up. We have just got to convince our respective people that trade is in their interests. [GPE]-U.S. Relations [INTERVIEWER]. There is another [INTERVIEWED] you have such a good relationship; it is [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Very good working relationship, on terrorism, on oil. But there is this feeling also this is in cost of some human rights, human rights in [GPE], press freedom in [GPE]-it is overlooked now-and probably some freedom of some other [NORP] republics. Do not you worry that this close relationship is putting your-raising other problems? [INTERVIEWED]. No, a close relationship with [PERSON] allows me to make the case that, on media freedom, for example-as a matter of fact, on my last trip there, I urged him to interface with media entrepreneurs from [GPE] to understand how free press actually works, something that they are not very used to in [GPE]. And so there have been dialog interchanges now with some of our media executives. And I do push [PERSON] on the need to have open media and open his media. And secondly, in terms of [GPE], I am constantly talking to [PERSON] about relations with [GPE] and understanding and supporting minority rights. The other issue that is very important, to which we do not turn a blind eye, and which I am deeply concerned, not only about minority rights, is proliferation, matters of proliferation. I think we are making some progress there. The immediate concern was proliferation to [GPE], and I brought that up with [PERSON] every time I visited with him. It is a very important issue that he understand that an armed [GPE] could be very dangerous to his own country, much less to our friends the [NORP] or [GPE], itself. And we have had some very important exchanges on that. In terms of helping make [GPE] a more secure place, we are working on what they call [CARDINAL] [MONEY] from the [GPE], [MONEY] from Europe over [DATE] to help secure some weapons stockpiles. [PERSON] is very interested in working with us to decommission some of his nuclear submarines to make [GPE] and the world more safe. In other words, my only point to you is, is that by being closer to [GPE], we are able to deal more directly with some of the thorny issues that could separate us and could in fact make the West less likely to deal with [GPE]. And we have got another issues at home here that has upset a lot of our people, and that is chickens. Fortunately, we are arguing over chickens and not over war, over chickens and not over missiles, like we used to. But a lot of people here feel like there was a commitment made to let [GPE] chickens into [GPE]. And they started moving into [GPE], and all of a sudden they stopped moving into [GPE]. And so I have been-so whether it be trade or minority rights or press, our relations are such that we are able to bring those up in a very frank and forthright way and yet still moved a very important relationship forward. Look, friends do not always agree, but friends are more likely to be able to work things out than enemies. As a matter of fact, in [DATE], if there was a disagreement between enemies, that could lead to war. And there will not be a war between [GPE] and [GPE]. Situation in the Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a question on another very easy subject, the Middle East crisis. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. What solution do you see to the crisis, and what compromise do you expect from both sides? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that is a very good question. First, I do believe that we can achieve a vision of [CARDINAL] states living side by side, at peace with each other. And that is the vision, and that is what all policy must aim toward. It starts with understanding that it is going to be impossible to achieve that vision if terrorists are allowed to have a free run and blow up the process. An incredibly important step toward the vision of [CARDINAL] states living side by side is for the international community, including the [NORP] world, to work with us to develop the institutions necessary for the emergence of a [NORP] state that will be transparent; it will respect rule of law; it will have a constitution that will allow for a sharing-of-power arrangement; that will have institutions that outlast-are far more important than any single one person. And we are in the process of working toward that end. [PERSON] will be meeting with what the call the [ORG] in [GPE]. Foreign Ministers from the [NORP] world will be coming as well, later on, to work on the step-by-step process toward the emergence of a [NORP] state. And I repeat, that requires a constitution, a judiciary, transparency when it comes to financial conditions. And I believe there is financial aid available. I know there is. [At this point, the tape machine stopped.] [INTERVIEWED]. Something just ground to a halt. That thing had, what do we call it, a skidding halt. Sounded like it needs some new tires. Anyway, the international community wants to help with aid, but they are not going to help with aid if it is going to be stolen. Let us put it very bluntly. And so the-- [The tape machine stopped again.] [INTERVIEWED]. --the press conference has clearly gone too long. [Laughter] So we are working to get these institutions in place. Obviously as security improves, [GPE] is going to have to, as I said, pull her troops back to [DATE] levels. In other words-not levels but geographic-within geographic boundaries of [DATE]. They are going to have to deal with the settlements. In other words, all parties have got responsibilities. The [NORP] world has got responsibilities, by the way, as well, to help on the development of a security force necessary-a security force, by the way, which must exist to enforce security, not enhance the status of a single person. So we are making progress. It requires a international commitment and a focus on a positive end, which is [CARDINAL] states living side by side in peace. As I said, I am an optimistic fellow and believe that if we stay at it and keep working hard, we can get there. But there is no question in my mind, as I said in my speech in [FAC] recently, that there is going to be some setbacks. But our [ORG] is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. All right, well, thank you all.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprimeministertonyblairtheunitedkingdomdavidfrostthebritish", "text": "[GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. Prime Minister, [INTERVIEWED], it is a great joy to be talking. And let us begin on the subject that is on everybody's minds [DATE], the subject of [GPE]. The vote may be more perilously close than was hoped [DATE] 2 ago. What is your message that each of you have right now to persuade doubting [NORP] or doubting [NORP] to persuade? How would you both begin? Prime Minister [PERSON]. I think it is in many ways a battle between fear and emotion on the [CARDINAL] hand and reason and hope on the other. And the fear and the emotion is totally understandable, but it is important that people vote for reason and hope. And I say that because people ask me for reassurances on certain of the key items of the agreement. They say, Reassure us that the [ORG] is not going to be disbanded or stop being a proper police force. I give that reassurance. That will be plain. I give the reassurance, the absolute commitment that, if the cross-community provisions in the agreement to exclude people from office if they engage in violence, if those do not work, then they will be changed. That will be in the legislation. I give the explicit commitment to people that decommissioning will be a factor that we take into account, a factor there, specified in the legislation, so that, if people are not abiding by the decommissioning arrangements of [ORG], then that can mean their exclusion or removal from office. I give the explicit commitment that people, whether in the [ORG] or the shadow assembly, cannot sit in office in [GPE] if they are engaged in the ballot box and the gun as a twin strategy. Now, all those reassurances I can give. But in the end, it depends whether people are really wanting to give themselves the chance for stability and prosperity in the future, because the alternative is not where we are now. The alternative is for [GPE] to slip back. So I hope that people will take that chance for the future. [INTERVIEWER]. What is the reassurance? What is the message you want to get across? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Well, of course, [GPE] is the home of the largest [NORP] diaspora, you know, both [NORP] Protestants and [NORP]. And so I suppose outside of the people involved, we care more about it than any other people. And I have worked hard to create the conditions within which the [NORP] could make their own peace. And what I would like to say is, first, I am convinced there will be a great deal of increased interest in and investment in and partnership with [GPE] if this matter can be carried forward. Secondly, I have made it as clear as I can that anyone who abandons the peace, if this agreement is embraced, anybody who returns to violence is never going to be a friend of [GPE]. We will not tolerate it. We will not support it. We will do everything we can to affirmatively oppose it. But finally-I remember when I went there in [DATE]. I remember the looks on the faces of the people, especially the young people, the schoolchildren I spoke with, both the [NORP] and the [NORP] children. And I'd just like to ask the voters to imagine what will happen if they vote no, and what do they really have to lose by voting yes, by giving this a chance? I mean, their leaders came up with this plan. Prime Minister [PERSON] worked very hard on it. Prime Minister [PERSON] did. But the leaders in [GPE] agreed to this plan. What have they got to lose, really, by trying it? Nothing. But they have a great deal to lose by walking away, and I hope that they will not walk away. [INTERVIEWER]. And you mention, in terms of investment and so on, there are ways in which the new [GPE]-you could help the new [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Oh, absolutely. Of course, we try [DATE] now. We have [ORG]. We have a very active group of [NORP] citizens from both the [NORP] and [NORP] communities, [NORP] citizens who try to increase investment. But I can tell you that the wave of elation that will sweep the friends of [GPE] in [GPE], should this be accepted, will be enormous. And there will just be a lot more willingness to get involved here and try to help build a future. [INTERVIEWER]. And in terms of the people, Prime Minister, who say, well, you have got, on the [CARDINAL] hand, [ORG] saying this is a step toward a united [GPE]; you have got [PERSON] saying, on the other hand, that this strengthens the Union. How can both be true? Prime Minister [PERSON]. Well, I think the point is the principle of consent-in other words, that you can argue your case, whether it is for [GPE] remaining inside the [GPE] or a united [GPE]-the principle of consent means you have to argue it by democracy, not violence. And so people are free to argue their case. But it is a way of arguing it that is peaceful. And one of the strange things about the debate in [GPE] is that people are not actually arguing now about the principle of consent. That was what, for [DATE], divided people in [GPE]. People now accept that. They are not even arguing about the institutional structures, the cross-border bobbies, [ORG]. That in a sense is agreed, as well. It is this fear and emotion, as I say. You see, prisoners is an example of it. And let me again try and go right to the heart of what I think people feel in [GPE]. They see the scenes of [ORG] or [PERSON] and they say, Well, this is wrong, and the no campaign then say, Oh well, the prisoners will be back on the street if you vote for this agreement. Again, the facts are these: [PERSON] and [ORG] were allowed out under provisions on day release made [DATE] before I even came to government. It had nothing to do with the agreement. Most of the prisoners now in jail in [GPE] will be out within [DATE] anyway. But they will be out, of course, without the agreement and without stability if there is no vote. So again, I understand the concerns that people have, but I do ask them to realize that if no is the vote [DATE], what is the future? What are we going to offer children in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. You know, if I could just say sort of as an interested friend, an outside observer-as you know, I have been very involved in the [NORP] peace, in the Middle East peace process-I think, essentially, the people that are for this want a better future for their children and do not want any more violence and like the fact that there is now a process which has been agreed upon for moving forward. If you really listen to the arguments of the people that are against it-and I have tried to listen very respectfully-it is that they still do not trust those on the other side because of all the things that have gone before. In [DATE] [PERSON], right before we signed the agreement between [GPE] and the [ORG], said to me, I have spent my life as a soldier. I have killed a lot of these people, and they have killed a lot of my people. But, he said, [INTERVIEWED], you do not make peace with your friends. You make peace, and then you make friends. And I think that is important here. But in [GPE] the people live much more closely together. They have in some ways-they have not killed each other in the way the [NORP] did. With all the horrible things, they can get over this if they just will-it is a little bit of a leap of faith, but the risks of doing it are so much less than the risks of walking away. [INTERVIEWER]. And I think that example is a very relevant one, of [PERSON], because that is the problem with the moderate [NORP], some of them, who've got concern. I think you have dealt with the point about the prisoners. You said that a lot of them would be coming out in [DATE] anyway, and that links in with their fear of decommissioning of arms and that, therefore, there will be lots of killers running around with arms and so on. But how do you respond to that? Prime Minister [PERSON]. Well, I respond to it by saying that we will make it quite clear, explicitly in the legislation, that the twin strategy of ballot box and gun is not going to be permitted. And that all the things, in terms of seats in the [GPE] executive, in terms of accelerated prisoner release, they can only happen if there is real peace, a real end to violence, an end to violence for good, not temporarily, permanently, an end to violence. I think it is possible that we can achieve that. But we have got to achieve it with people really making this agreement work. And all the time that we spent trying to put this together, it was agonizingly difficult. And yet in the end, I think there is the will out there amongst people in [GPE]; there is the hope to make it work. Nuclear Proliferation in South Asia [INTERVIEWER]. We will come back to that subject before the end of the conversation. But you have been examining a lot of other issues and [CARDINAL] issues have come up to take up a lot of your time at this conference. And obviously, [CARDINAL] of them is [GPE] and, obviously, a slight difference of emphasis on what you think should be done and what you have done than the other members of [ORG]. Why do you feel the way you do, [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Do you mean why do I think that we should not only condemn the [NORP] action but take some economic action against [GPE]? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I just think we need to do as much as possible to make it clear that, in the world of [DATE] and [DATE], it is simply unacceptable to build a nuclear arsenal. And it is unrealistic to believe you can build one and you will not use it under any circumstances. Therefore, the main purpose of doing it is to establish yourself as a great nation. That is not a way to define a nation's greatness in [DATE]. And I say that because I think the firmer we are here, the more likely we are to be able to persuade [GPE], or perhaps other countries lining up behind [GPE], that they should not test, that they should not try to become public members of the nuclear club. We need to move the world away from it. I am trying to get [GPE] to ratify START II now so we can dismantle our arsenals further and then go to START III and dismantle our arsenals further. I am trying to take [GPE] and [GPE] in the opposite direction. I am afraid in our own countries, we will have people who say, Oh, we better not do that if [GPE] and [GPE] and other countries are going to build up their arsenals. It is just-it is not the way to the future. [INTERVIEWER]. And so the message to Pakistan- there is rumors that they may be testing [DATE] in western [GPE], or whatever- would be that you would take-you feel you should take the same action against them if they did? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Well, under our law, we will have no choice. In other words, it is an automatic under our law. But what I would say to them is, help us work with you to find a way, first of all, to guarantee your security without nuclear weapons, and secondly, to reconcile with [GPE]. I mean, look at [GPE] and [GPE]. You have got [CARDINAL] country with [CARDINAL] people, another country with [CARDINAL] people. They are arguing principally over Kashmir, not entirely but principally. Now, if they could resolve this, if you look at the success of [NORP] and [NORP] in [GPE] or in [GPE] and you look at the talent in those [CARDINAL] countries and you realize, if they would liberate themselves from this argument between themselves, it is quite conceivable that for [DATE] they could have the highest growth rates and not just economic success but the richest and most textured quality of life on the [NORP] subcontinent of any place on the globe. And so I think they should be imagining a different future for themselves, both of them. Have the rest of us failed to appreciate them as much as we should have? Probably. Have we failed to acknowledge [GPE] the incredible achievement of maintaining [DATE] of democracy under the most adverse conceivable circumstances? Probably. We should do better. But the answer is not for [GPE] to become a nuclear power and then for [GPE] to match it stride for stride, and then for [GPE] to be brought in to support the [NORP] and move troops to the [NORP] border, and then for [GPE] to come in and recreate in a different context the conflicts of the cold war. It is a nutty way to go. It is not the way to chart the future. [INTERVIEWER]. And in fact, you spoke to the [NORP] Prime Minister. Did you think that the optimists might have a point when they say that now they have done this test; maybe they will sign the nonproliferation and the test ban treaties; they just needed to do this. So it is good news? Or is that just whistling in the wind? Prime Minister [PERSON]. Well, I certainly hope that they are prepared to do that, and there will be very, very strong pressure from the international community for them to come, unconditionally, into both treaties. And I think it is tremendously important they do so. Because as the [INTERVIEWED] was saying, I mean, if we have nuclear proliferation in the world-[GPE]-then if [GPE] were again to defy what is a very, very strong plea to them from the rest of the world not to engage in this, then you have got the danger of other states as well. So I mean, we are dealing with extremely serious and threatening present dangers. Situation in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. What about [GPE], talking of serious and threatening dangers? I mean, there is not much that could be done, is there? I mean, you have all said you are not going to seek to get rid of Mr. [PERSON], although you probably would not sob if he decided to step down of his own accord. But what is there that the rest of the world can do about a situation like that, or is it an example of where you can do nothing? Prime Minister [PERSON]. Well, I do not think you can do nothing. We cannot interfere in their own internal politics, it is true. But a lot of the discussions that we have had over [DATE] have been about we bring about greater stability in the financial systems of the world, because the crisis in Asia that has rocked many of the economies there will have an impact right round the world, is already having, may have an even more serious impact in the future. So what we can do is try and devise the right architecture, if you like, for the financial systems of the world which lead to greater stability, more openness, more transparency, and where we keep the advantages of global markets and trade, but try and make sure that that happens within a system that is properly regulated. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Keep in mind, [GPE] is the fourth or fifth largest country in the world in population. So, even though what we have seen on the television is very troubling, this is a vast country, the largest [NORP] country in the world, with a very complex society that has been through a very traumatic [DATE]. And I think it is important to point out that the world community has not been idle. We have been working hard since [DATE]-at least since [DATE] to try to help [GPE] come out of its economic problems. But we have felt all along that ultimately, to build a stable modern economy and to avoid this crisis, there would have to be some way for the Government and the [INTERVIEWED] to deal with all elements of society on some sort of democratic basis. And that is what our statement says. So what we want is to see [GPE] come out of this whole and healthy. They should decide the fate of all their leaders; it should be up to the people to decide. But this is not a hopeless situation yet. This is a great country full of talented people with staggering economic achievements in [DATE]-staggering. So I think that what we have to do is to hope for the best and try to guard against the worst and keep working with them. [NORP] Economies [INTERVIEWER]. And do you feel-you mentioned there as we led into that, the subject of the [NORP] situation. [INTERVIEWED], do you feel that the worst is over in the [NORP] economic crisis, that it is on the mend, or is still on the jaws of-- [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I think it is hard to generalize. I think the [GPE] have done very well and a tribute to their leadership. [GPE] is doing better. [GPE] is clearly coming back, which is very good, because it is a big part of the economy. And [GPE] is having a difficult time, but they have a lot of strong economic underpinnings. And [GPE] is the big question. The other thing, of course, is that Japan- Prime Minister [PERSON] is struggling mightily now to put together a package that will restore growth in [GPE]. If growth comes back to the [NORP] economy, that will-because it so dwarfs the others in size, it will cure a lot of these problems. Prime Minister [PERSON]. I mean, the fundamentals are strong, actually, in the [NORP] economies, but we have just got to work together to put the right system around it so that both systems are helped. Third World Debt Relief [INTERVIEWER]. Does all these other issues mean that you will make less progress on the whole area of Third World debt at [ORG] than you both hoped, or can you catch up? Prime Minister [PERSON]. No. I think, in fact, we have had a very good meeting on Third World debt, and we have agreed on a number of specific measures, including greater help for countries, particularly if they are in a post-conflict situation or there is been conflict there, and for the highly indebted countries. Because for many of these countries-in Africa-the [INTERVIEWED] has just been there recently and so knows better than most of us-but there is tremendous potential there. But they are struggling under this huge burden of debt. Often their political systems have been a tremendous handicap to them, but there is progress on the democratic front there. But we have got to give them the help that we can, whilst making sure that we are not just channeling aid, but we are actually making sure that that money, when it goes in, is going to be used properly and where we are trying to alleviate the debt burden so that they can come out of this situation of crisis that they have been in. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I think to be fair, when Prime Minister [PERSON] took over the head of [ORG], [CARDINAL] of his initiatives was to have the right kind of debt relief. And we have embraced, now for a little more than a year, a strategy for the highly indebted poor countries that says we will-we know we should do debt relief, but it will not do any good unless they do things to help themselves. So we will have a structured system where we will give much, much more help to the highly indebted poor countries that actually undertake their own reform, so that we believe the debt relief will actually amount to money being invested in their future in a positive way. And when I went to Africa, one of the things I saw was the countries with honest governments can channel the energy, the intelligence, the passion of a wonderful people and get a lot done. So I am more optimistic about Africa than I was before I went there. But I do believe that we should help those who are trying to help themselves. Prime Minister [PERSON]. It is interesting. It is one of the great lessons of [DATE] that democracy and prosperity in the end go together. The Euro and the Dollar [INTERVIEWER]. In terms of prosperity, [CARDINAL] lightening question occurs to me. The euro-we are talking about the euro here-what will be the implications of a strong euro on the dollar, [INTERVIEWED]? Could it be bad news for the dollar? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I do not think so. It could become, some time in the future, an alternative currency. You know, people might trade in the euro as well as the dollar. It could become- a lot of transactions might be done in the euro as well as the dollar. But I do not see that as a threatening thing. I think anything that brings free people closer together and increases prosperity in a democratic way, that makes it more likely to be broadly shared, is positive. So I think as long as that is what is going on- you know, Europe-a unified Europe, it seems to me, is still committed to freedom, still committed to openness, still committed to a certain generosity of spirit, and I think that has to be good for the world. What we are trying to do, slowly but surely, is to integrate political and economic and social systems of the world not in ways that diminish national sovereignty but that alleviate the problems of the world and enable us to tackle together those things we cannot solve alone. Advice for Prime Minister [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. And you have a great working relationship, the [CARDINAL] of you, but [CARDINAL] difference between you, of course, is that [INTERVIEWED], you are in your second term and the Prime Minister is early in his first term. What is the most important advice to someone in their first time in order to get into their second term? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Oh, I think he is doing it. I think that-the most important thing I think he can do is to keep the commitments he made in the campaign and to stay in touch with the people and to not be deterred from doing the public's business. You know, people, when they hire you to do these jobs, they want you to work on their affairs. And then when you get in them, there is all sorts of static designed to break your concentration. You have to ignore it and stay at the business. But I think my advice would be to-he had a very detailed theory about why he wanted to be Prime Minister and where he wanted [GPE] to go, and of course, I have a lot of sympathy with the ideas he put forward, and he is doing a good job of doing what he promised to do. And I think that is the most important thing. And then I think as-the more you get into it, then I think the more you begin to think about what is it going to be like when my children are my age; what is it going to be like when my grandchildren are here. And the more he serves, the more he will have an impact on that as well. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. And along the way, one of the things you have both had to also conquer is to bring up your families under the glare of all that publicity when the children go to school and all of that. But that is fascinating. Well, at the end of our time, let us return for a moment to where we began. Are you both confident, but not complacent as politicians always say, are you confident that the [GPE] people on [DATE] will take a decision which you believe passionately is the right decision, a positive decision, that they will feel the hand of history on their shoulder? Are you confident about that? Prime Minister [PERSON]. I mean, I am confident, but I do know that they are considering this really with their heart and their head, and they are going into tremendous detail. And I think that over [DATE] it is important that people put their concerns to people like myself and, perhaps, particularly to me and that I answer those concerns, so that people go in and vote yes, in a spirit of real optimism and confidence themselves about the future. And they can do that. [INTERVIEWER]. And do you have to have, or not- you do not have to have a majority of [PERCENT] in each community in [GPE], do not have to have that. Do you want that? Do you need it? Prime Minister [PERSON]. No, we do not have to have it, but I want as big a vote as possible in both communities. And I want this to be an agreement where we, for once and for all, we get rid of the [CARDINAL]-sum game in [GPE] politics which says if [CARDINAL] side is happy with something, that means I am unhappy. Both communities, both traditions, if you like, within [GPE] can be satisfied with this, because for the [NORP], the principle of consent is there; for the [NORP] community there is fairness and equity of treatment, the recognition of the [NORP] identity. That is what this is-you know, I said this on [DATE] after that marathon negotiation we went through, that in the end it is not a fudge, this agreement; it is an historic settlement of [NORP] and [NORP] aspirations. And what it means is that in a new world, [DATE] off [DATE], where everything is changing around [GPE], Europe, [GPE], our relations with the rest of the world, where people can argue their case free in the knowledge that they can do so democratically rather than by resorting to violence-now, that is the historic settlement. And that is why I want as many people in both communities to come out and support it. [INTERVIEWER]. What are your thoughts, [INTERVIEWED]? Are you confident? Can this be a winwin situation for both sides? [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Oh, absolutely. There is no question in my view that, if they vote for the accord, it will turn out to be a win-win. I mean, think about where the world is going to be in [DATE]. Just think about [DATE]. You will have a much more globalized economy; you will have both [GPE] and [GPE] more involved in the [NORP] economy, more involved in the rest of the world, and more involved with each other, meeting at the tip of [GPE], economically and psychologically, no matter what the legal framework is. Now, the people that are at that vortex are going to have a very interesting, very rich, very good life if they vote to live it together. If they vote to stay apart, they are still going to be frustrated, distrustful, angry, and a little bit left out. And I think all of us, we have hope and fear inside. I say all the time, we all have little scales inside, and [DATE] we wake up with hope weighing down, [DATE] with fear weighing down. I think on [DATE] the clearheadedness of the [NORP] people will prevail in [GPE]. I think that both communities will go in and vote for the future. I just ask them to think about what the world will be like, what these islands will be like [DATE], and what they want [GPE] to be. We know that democracies of diverse people are interesting places to be when your uniqueness is valued, but you understand that what you have in common as human beings is more important than what divides you. That is a fundamental thing we know. And I believe they will accept that on [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you so much. Because the other part of it is that when Mr. [PERSON] says, or is quoted as saying, Look, if there is a no vote, then they will all just get in and renegotiate it. That is not on, is it? Prime Minister [PERSON]. Well, no. I mean, look, I always say to people, of course, We are here, and we will try and pick up the pieces as best we can. But I mean it would be fundamentally wrong to say that to people. We would be in a situation, too, where it would not be the status quo, where actually there is quite a lot of hope about, and people do feel they are making progress. We go backwards. I mean the [CARDINAL] thing I have learned in this whole process is if it does not go forward, it goes backwards. It never stays in the same place. So of course, we are the government, we pick up the pieces when everything goes wrong. But I think what the [INTERVIEWED] has just said there, and has said as a visionist, what people can aspire to-- [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. And the answer to that is, this agreement-I mean, I can see that even as an outsider-this agreement sets up a framework to embody in a thousand ways the principle of consent. If he does not like some detail, then the people will be perfectly free to modify it in the future within the framework of the agreement. So why take the risk that this moment will not present itself again for [DATE], when anything that he believes is wrong with it, if he thinks he can persuade a majority he is right, can be modified by the people themselves in the future? [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, both, very much, indeed. Mr. Prime Minister, [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Prime Minister [PERSON]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprimeministertonyblairtheunitedkingdomjohnkingthecablenews", "text": "Northern Ireland Peace Process [INTERVIEWER]. Let me start by thanking both of you for sharing some time on what is obviously [DATE]. We are in [DATE] of the campaign for the peace initiative in [GPE], and suddenly there seems to be apprehension, a lot of opposition. You see some slippage in the public opinion polls, the critics saying that you see these people, terrorists, criminals, at rallies being hailed as heroes. Each of you, if you could share your thoughts on what you think of the tone of the campaign, and do you share that apprehension? And how do you counter the message of those who say, vote no? [INTERVIEWED]. I think before we get a vote as important as this, there is bound to be a lot of apprehension, consideration by people, and it is right that they treat this seriously, because it affects their future. And one of the fascinating things is there has been very little debate in this referendum campaign about the institutional structure, [ORG], the relationship with [GPE], because the thing has wrecked every attempt to have a peace agreement in [GPE] for [DATE]. Instead, people are worried, as you say, about things like prisoners. But as I say to people, when you look at the facts, these guys who were out on the platform [DATE] under day-release schemes, they were done [DATE]. The vast majority of prisoners will be out within [DATE] anyway. And in the end, people have got to look at the package as a whole and say, What is the best for the future: to have stability and prosperity and the chance to bring up your children with some prospect of staying in [GPE] and doing well, or to slip back into the ways that [GPE] knew for [DATE] upon [DATE] of division and bitterness and hatred? [INTERVIEWED]. I think some of the reservation has come from people who wonder: Well, is there some sort of trick here; can somebody have it both ways; can they be part of the political life of the country; and can they sort of condone violence? And I can tell you, at least from [GPE]'s point of view, the answer to that is no. Anybody who resorts to violence will have no friends in [GPE]. I do not care what side they are on or what their heritage is or what their previous ties are. And I think I can speak for the overwhelming majority of [NORP] in both the [NORP] and [NORP] communities, that all we have ever wanted was a just peace. This peace embodies the principle of consent. It gives the [NORP] people of both traditions the right to chart their future in [GPE] and to make of it what they will. I think, if it is embraced, you will see a big increase in involvement of [NORP] and other [NORP] eager to invest in [GPE], eager to lift prosperity and to show people the benefits of peace. And so I very much hope that they will take that leap of faith and ask themselves a simple question: What is the downside risk of going forward? It is so much lower than the downside risk of blowing this opportunity. [INTERVIEWER]. You, at [CARDINAL] point, considered visiting at the end of this trip, going to [GPE], to [GPE], decided not, perhaps that it would be viewed as meddling. Now in [TIME], you have decided to speak out again forcefully, publicly. Why did you feel that necessary? And in your view, what role can you play in that process? And sir, what role do you think the people of [GPE] will consider as they listen to the [NORP] President? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I decided to speak out because I think that the people of [GPE] know that I care a lot about the peace process, that [GPE] has been involved in it, that we have tried to not only-I think it is important to point out not only has Mr. [PERSON], the [ORG] leader, been to [GPE] a lot, but I have spent far more time with Mr. [PERSON] and other leaders, [NORP] leaders, than any [NORP] President ever has. I have tried to listen to both sides, to learn, to just encourage them to make their own peace and chart their own future. And so I think it is appropriate for me to speak out. I just was afraid if I went there-I can remember when people from outside used to come to my home [GPE] and try to influence elections. It never worked, because in the end voters instinctively know they have to live with the consequences of their decision. So that is different. But if a journalist like you asks me a question about what I think the arguments are, I think that it is important for me to answer. And I hope that people on all sides of the issue will listen to what I have to say, because at least I have some experience here; I know something about this. I know something about what happened in [GPE]; I know something about what happened in the Middle East; I know something about people who are divided and the difference in peace and war, or peace and sort of purgatory with violence. And peace has unfailingly been better, in the toughest of circumstances. [INTERVIEWER]. As to people who actually get a vote listen to him, your friend, why should they listen to him? [INTERVIEWED]. I think people do listen because people know the President is sincere, deeply committed, and actually knowledgeable about what has happened in [GPE]. And I can say, right from the time I became Prime Minister, but actually before that when the President visited [GPE] in [DATE] I think it was, that his visit made a huge impact. People felt that he was someone that understood. Perhaps more than any other [NORP] President, people really feel that [INTERVIEWED] both understands, knows, and people, they can also feel his willing them to do well. And I think people certainly will listen to that very much. [INTERVIEWER]. As you look forward to this vote, take us back if you will. You have described this process as agonizingly difficult. In [TIME], you had a series of transatlantic conversations yourselves. Mr. [PERSON], you were on the phone with Mr. [PERSON] I believe twice, Mr. [PERSON] at least once, [PERSON]. Can you take us inside those conversations, pacing, raising your voice? You had people on each side that, Nevermind, I cannot do this. I am going to back out. How did you keep it together, and how did you interrelate personally as you went through this process? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think it was so much a question of raising our voice or-obviously, these are conversations that you have with people at a particularly difficult moment, and you do not go right back over them the whole time. But I think in many ways what I found was tremendously useful in respect to the President's intervention was that people did and do respect his views on it, because, obviously in part, he is the President of [GPE], but actually it is more to do with him personally, having shown commitment all the way through, having listened to all sides in the conflict, and therefore having some standing because of this own personal commitment, some credibility, if you like, to say to people, Look, the eyes of the world are upon us. Let us see if we can go for this thing and make it happen. [INTERVIEWER]. And as [DATE] night turned to Good Friday, at any point did you think: This is not going to happen; it is going to collapse? [INTERVIEWED]. I am afraid I thought that pretty regularly, at about [TIME] intervals. But in the end-I mean, what always comes back home to me is we are [DATE] off [DATE]; there is so much happening in the world, so many changes that I have seen in [DATE] of my lifetime. I cannot believe [DATE] off [DATE] that a place like [GPE], which has got this extraordinary potential, where the people are tremendous people, as you know if you have been there, I cannot believe we cannot find a way to live with each other [DATE] off [DATE] with all the changes in the world, with all the possibilities there are. So even though a lot of the time I was sitting there thinking, Can we really make this happen, I have a sort of inner optimism about it. [INTERVIEWER]. And what was your message in those phone calls? You were probably half asleep as you started some of them. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I just- when I talked to Prime Minister [PERSON] or Prime Minister [PERSON] or [PERSON], I was mostly listening. But when I talked to the parties, what I heard from them actually was very like what you are hearing from the general public now. It was sort of the darkness before the dawn. It was like, Okay, we made this deal, and oh, there is a few things down the road that we'd like to improve, but what they really needed was not me to talk about the specifics; what they really needed was for me to remind them of the big picture, that it was time to join hands and jump off the diving board together and get in the pool and swim to shore. And I say that not in a disrespectful way but in a respectful way. It is very hard, once you have been estranged from people for a long time, to overcome your fears and distrust. And as I have said repeatedly, I will never forget Prime Minister [PERSON] telling me before [GPE] signed the agreement with the [ORG], that everybody was reluctant to do it, but you do not make peace with your friends. You have to make peace with those and then make them your friends, because of the estrangement of the past. That is what I want people to think about. If every voter in [GPE] says, What are we going to look like in [DATE], and what is it going to look like in [DATE], [GPE] here- Mr. [PERSON] is the President of the [ORG] in this cycle. [GPE] leading the united Europe; [GPE] a part of the united Europe with [CARDINAL] of the best reforming economies, [GPE]; [GPE], where [GPE] and [GPE] join in some sort of fashion no matter what decision they make. Now, they are going to be at the vortex of something very, very big, if they can just liberate themselves it could change the past. They do not have to give up their traditions; they can value them. They have agreed to the principle of consent. They have set up a mechanism by which they can chart their own future. What remains is really just to take the leap of faith and realize that the risk of going forward is infinitesimal, tiny, compared to the risk of letting this opportunity slip away. Nuclear Proliferation in South Asia [INTERVIEWER]. We are short on time, so if I could ask each of you in closing, tensions in another part of the world have been a major theme of discussion here at your meeting, the [NORP] Prime Minister [DATE] saying he was disappointed in the communique relating to condemning [GPE] for the nuclear test. If I could ask each of you your reaction to that and how you see that process going forward in [DATE] ahead. [INTERVIEWED]. It is a very strong statement in the communique, condemning the [NORP] nuclear tests and, what is more, putting strong pressure on [GPE] to sign up unconditionally for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And I urge [GPE] now, as we all do in our communique, not to follow them down that route because the world is a dangerous enough place as it is, and we fear for the future if these nuclear tests carry on. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first, it is the strongest possible statement we could have gotten. Some of our members are philosophically opposed to the imposition of sanctions under virtually any circumstances. And as you know, [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], perhaps others will follow, did impose economic sanctions. But it is a strong statement. What we have now to do is to build on it. We have to tell the [NORP], If you are willing to not go down this road, which we believe is a loser, let us work together to try to define a way to protect your security without becoming a nuclear power. And we have to go back to the [NORP] and say, Let us find a way to protect your security and honor the greatness of your democracy without becoming a nuclear power. This is a bad thing, but let us minimize this. This is not a good thing for the world. The [NORP] and the [NORP], we are trying to lower our nuclear arsenals. We are trying to make this problem go away for the world. And we do not need to just have a whole lot of other people with smaller nuclear arsenals on the assumption that they will never be used. You cannot do that. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you both. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprintjournalists", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. I have got a couple of opening comments, and we will go around the table a couple of times and answer your questions. First, I am really looking forward to my trip. We are involved with a lot of interesting initiatives that will help the world grow toward peace and freedom, and this trip will be an opportunity to not only to talk about [NORP] values but to talk with friends, allies, important parties about how working together we can achieve grand goals, the goals of peace, the goals of freedom, the goals of hope and prosperity. I start off in [GPE]. It is my second trip to [GPE] since I have been [INTERVIEWED]. I am going to [GPE]; I am going to [FAC]. I am going to give a speech, which I am still working on right now, but it is a speech that reminds us that together we can achieve the big objective. It is a speech, really, to Europe that says that our common values are strong and that we welcome the emergence of countries like free countries like [GPE], and as well as we must be reminded of the lessons of the past. I am going to [FAC] to see firsthand one of the greatest lessons of the past, that there is evil in this world and that the only way to deal with the evil is together. And we did so in the past, and now there is you know, terrorism and killing of innocent people is evil, and we have got to work together to achieve the same objectives that were achieved in the past, and that is peace and freedom. And then I go on to [GPE] to not only honor the great city of [GPE], their 300th anniversary, but also to have an important dialog with [PERSON]. It will be a dialog that will really show the world that in spite of our disagreements over what happened in [GPE], that our relationship is strong and that we can move together in positive ways. Then I go to [ORG]. I know the press corps is going to be you know, they will be observing [ORG] as a great you know, will this turn into a meeting a confrontational meeting? The answer is absolutely not. It is an opportunity to talk with some who agreed with us on [GPE] and some who did not , about how we move forward. And I have laid the groundwork for the trip by talking about some great goals that wealthy nations can achieve. [CARDINAL], of course, is to fight AIDS in Africa. Another which is to enhance trade, so that people have a chance to rise out of poverty, and others address famine as well as to continue to keep our focus on dealing with those terrorists who would like to hold the world blackmail the world as well as to kill innocents, take innocent life. I then go from there to the Middle East. It is going to be a significant visit. [CARDINAL], it says that I am committed to the peace process; that I look forward to working with the new [NORP] leadership as well as [PERSON] to make it clear to the world that we have as leaders, we have the intention of working together to achieve peace, that there is a commitment, a personal commitment, not just by me but a personal commitment by Prime Minister [PERSON] as well was Prime Minister [PERSON], to work together to achieve peace; and that there are responsibilities that all of us have as leaders, not only responsibility to the new Prime Minister of [ORG], not only the responsibility of the [NORP] Prime Minister, but a responsibility for the leadership in the [NORP] world to fight terror, prevent killers from stopping the process from going forward. And so the first stop will be in [GPE], in [GPE]. I am really looking forward to the visit. President [PERSON] has urged me, consistently urged me to come to [GPE], and this is my chance to see this spectacular part of [GPE]. And that is where I am going to meet with the [NORP] leaders, some of the [NORP] leaders, to talk about shared responsibility. I want them to hear from me firsthand the commitment of [GPE] to move toward peace in the Middle East. And I want them also to hear from me firsthand that I expect them to be partners in the process. And then I am going to go to [GPE]. Of course, I will see the King of [GPE]. I believe the King is going to be in [GPE] as well. And then I will have a bilateral meeting with the King. It will give me a chance to thank him for his strong support on the liberation of [GPE]. I am sure he will want to talk about matters of trade with [GPE], and I will be fully prepared to do so. And then I will meet with the Prime Minister of both [ORG] and of [GPE], and I am looking forward to these meetings. I believe in the possibilities of peace. I trust the Prime Minister of [ORG] when he condemns terror. I believe that provides an opening for [GPE] and others to expend the necessary energies to move the process forward. I will remind them that I was the first President ever to stand up and say I am for [CARDINAL] states, living side by side in peace. And I did so at [ORG]. I still have that vision. I believe it is possible. So I will talk to these [CARDINAL] leaders about our mutual desire to move the process forward. And then I go to [GPE], where I will meet with General [PERSON] and [PERSON] to talk about the reconstruction of [GPE]. I will also meet with [PERSON] of [GPE] and then speak to our troops, and head home. And this is a trip I am looking forward to. Let me answer some questions. Why do not we start here? [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], obviously your vision and your principles are quite commendable. The trouble is that so many people still have suspicions; they are afraid. Why do you think people remain suspicious and afraid of either your staying power, sir, or whether, you know well, please go ahead and then I will ask my [INTERVIEWED]. No, I understand your question. Oftentimes, we live in a processed world you know, people focus on the process and not results. What I am going to say to people who are suspicious of our motives: Let us work together to achieve positive results. And I fully understand, for example, the Middle East it is a suspicious world. There are suspicions of motives. And until people see the emergence of a [NORP] state, there will be suspicions; until I can prove for the average [NORP] citizen, there will be suspicions. And so I fully understand the skepticism. I mean, after all, we are dealing in a world where there is a lot of heartbreak, a lot of death, a lot of sorrow, a lack of hope. And until there is noticeable change, there is going to be suspicions. I have got great confidence in what [GPE] stands for. I have said to our country and to the world many times that in order for there to be peace, there must be freedom. And I believe that a free [ORG] and a free [NORP] people will yield to peace in that part of the world. Therefore, we are striving toward the development of such a state. And until people begin to see, however, the results of that vision, people will be skeptical. And the only thing I can do is to continue to speak out as clearly as I can about the values which motivate our foreign policy and motivate me personally and work hard to achieve results, tangible results. And when people see results, when the people see that the [NORP] people are more free and that their economy begins to develop, when people see that the [NORP] people have control of their own oil for the benefit of the [NORP] people, then some of the suspicions will be turned aside. I will never win the hearts of the terrorists, nor am I trying to, because the terrorists have got one thing in mind, murder to stop peace. And it stands in stark contrast to what I believe, which is freedom to bring peace. So, you know, there are some I would never try to win their hearts and minds over that are absolutely bent upon stopping not only what [GPE] is trying to do but a lot of other nations as well. So my answer to your question is: I understand skepticism; I understand the attitudes of some; but I refuse to be stopped in my desire to rally the world toward achieving positive results for each individual. I have said many times that freedom and human dignity is not [GPE]'s gift to the world; it is the Almighty God's gift to each and every individual. And I firmly believe that. And it is that principle which motivates my desire to see to it that the [NORP] mother or father can raise their child in a comfortable environment, knowing that their child can have a good education and the possibility of a peaceful life. And I feel the same way about the [NORP] citizen who grows up, a child who grows up in an environment where they can go to the market with their mother or father and get blown away. We must stop that kind of violence and provide hope for people. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a followup on the skepticism. Of course there is a lot of concern in the area, over and above the hope, because of your strong commitment. So what do you think will happen if the rush for the settlements continue? And how would it affect your vision of having a [NORP] state with borders and with land, a viable [NORP] state? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I believe that is important that there be a viable [NORP] state. I mean, it is the vision. I believe a viable [NORP] state with the institutions necessary for democracy and freedom to prevail, the institutions bigger than the occupants of the offices which they hold, is very important to gain the confidence not only of the neighborhood, the confidence of the [NORP], the confidence of other [NORP] nations, but the confidence of the free world as well. So I believe the emergence of a [NORP] state is very important. I have consistently said that the [NORP] are going to have to deal with the settlement issue and that there is a part of the process is going to be a focus on the settlements. I fully understand that settlement expansion is not in concert with the development of a state. And we will deal with that. And I will also remind everybody, however, that the process in order for the process to go forward, in order for there to be confidence of all parties, there must be an absolute determined effort to fight off terror, to not allow the few to destroy the process. I believe we can make progress, otherwise I would not be going. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. Well, since I am [NORP], I will ask you a [NORP] question. [INTERVIEWED]. In French or in [NORP]? [INTERVIEWER]. Well, I will try to do it in [NORP]. A number of [NORP] high officials have repeatedly said that [GPE] would have to pay the price for its opposition to your policy in [GPE]. So far, we did not see much as far as reprisals are concerned. Have you forgiven [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I look forward to working with [GPE] to achieve common objectives. Listen, let me be realistic. There is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the [NORP] people toward the [NORP] decision. That is realistic. People did not understand the decisions by the [NORP] leadership to thwart the desire for the [NORP] the [NORP] desire and the desire of others to work on security and freedom, security for our countries and freedom in [GPE]. However, that is not going to influence my policy. My decision is to go and to say [ORG]: Let us work together for a Europe which is whole, free, and at peace, a Europe in which countries are allowed to be friends of [GPE] and at the same time participate in institutions such as [ORG]; that rivalry will end up weakening our efforts to jointly deal with issues like security and peace and AIDS and trade. So, no, I will have a good discussion with [PERSON], and I am looking forward to going to [ORG], not only talking to [PERSON]; I will talk with others who have not necessarily agreed with our [GPE] policy. We have got a lot of work to do. And I have got work to do to convince the skeptics in [GPE] that the intentions of [GPE] are positive. And the [NORP] leadership has got work to do to convince the [NORP] people that they are concerned about the security of our country. And I will look forward to conducting that work with [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], please allow me in genuine [NORP] style to grab the bull by the horns. [INTERVIEWED]. Okay. [INTERVIEWER]. It is quite obvious that your personal relations with Mr. [PERSON] are much more developed, much more warm than the relations between [GPE] and [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. That is interesting. [INTERVIEWER]. At least there is no [PERSON]-Vanik amendment between [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. That is right. [INTERVIEWER]. And this situation [INTERVIEWED]. We need to get rid of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, I want you to know. Make sure the [NORP] people know that. [INTERVIEWER]. And this difference between your personal relations and the relations between our countries creates negative feelings in the [NORP] public opinion and among [NORP] elites. And that is why I think it somehow hinders President [PERSON] for his in his quest for further democratization and westernization of [GPE]. My question is, what do you want to undertake to upgrade the [NORP] relations to the same level as your personal relations with Mr. [PERSON], including, of course, the [PERSON]-Vanik amendment, which became in [GPE], unfortunately, the litmus paper of our relations? [INTERVIEWED]. Right. [INTERVIEWER]. And by the way, our [NORP] [NORP] are a little bit indignant that they are replaced by the [NORP] chicken. And instead of, Let my people go, now they say, Let our chicken come. And we do not understand in [GPE] how the genuine [NORP] eagle can defeat an artificial [NORP] chicken. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, at least we are arguing about chickens and not about whether or not we have got enough missiles pointed at each other. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. By the way, [INTERVIEWED], before you start answering my question, you can already do something in improving our relations. I brought [CARDINAL] books. If you sign them, you will improve the relations. It is for my [INTERVIEWED]. Okay. I am certainly not going to try to influence your story. [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, no, no for my Presidential library, which has all the signed books and pictures of all [NORP] Presidents, beginning with [PERSON] and, of course, your highly esteemed father. [INTERVIEWED]. You do not look that old. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, I am [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Okay, well, you are [DATE] [DATE]. Thank you, sir, for your question. First of all, [PERSON] and I do have a good relationship. And that is an important beginning in order to make sure the relationship is positive throughout our respective Governments. If we had a poisonous relationship, it would be awfully difficult to convince others in our Governments to work closely together. And so that is a positive beginning. Secondly, I did take note that the Moscow Treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both [ORG] in the [ORG]. That is a positive sign. As a matter of fact, if you think back, people if you put this in historical context, this treaty is pretty darn good progress early in our respective administrations. I mean, it happened quickly, which is a positive sign. In other words, [PERSON] and I made the decision that we will work together to create better conditions and make the world a more peaceful place. [CARDINAL] way to enhance relations between our Governments is to have a meaningful and real strategic dialog throughout our entire Government on key matters, so that the participants in both our Governments recognize that we are willing to not only share information but to deal with issues before they become problems and to work together in a collaborative way to show the world that we can handle and deal with some of the large issues, such as proliferation, for example. So therefore, we have got [PERSON], our Secretary of [ORG], working very closely with his counterpart. Secretary [PERSON] has got a task force set up to work very Agriculture Secretary to work very closely with her counterpart not only on chickens, but on other issues dealing with our farm communities. This dialog, this kind of strategic framework was initiated at my request and I think at [PERSON]'s request as well. But [PERSON], when she went over to [GPE], began the setting in place this capacity for our [CARDINAL] Governments to relate on a variety of issues in a consistent way. Now, I agree with [PERSON], we need to get rid of [PERSON]-Vanik, and have talked to our some of the folks on the [ORG] to deal with this issue. And I would like to get rid of [PERSON]-Vanik. I think it is an important symbol to say to the [NORP] people, The past is over. Now we move forward in a positive relationship. Yes, sir. Roles of [ORG] and [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a very quick question. What role, if any, you foresee for international organizations like the [ORG] or [ORG] in the future, for instance, in the war against terrorism and any other international conflict? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, good question. [ORG] I see a robust role for [ORG], which says that [ORG] must reform herself. [ORG] has got to be a military collaboration that is modern, that can move quickly, that is got the newest weapons. I will speak to [ORG] when I go to [GPE]. It is part of my speech in [GPE]. And it is I am a strong advocate of [ORG]. As you know, I, with [GPE], talked about the expansion of [ORG], which, thankfully, came to fruition and had been ratified the expansion has been ratified in our [GPE] Senate, overwhelmingly so. [ORG] is now its vision is beyond [DATE] of when [GPE] posed a threat to Europe. [ORG] is now willing to take on new assignments, all aimed at creating the same conditions of the past, in other words, a peaceful and free world. And that is why [ORG] is now in [GPE]. I welcome that. [ORG] will play a supportive role for [GPE] in [GPE]. I want to thank the [NORP] people for their and the Government for sending, I believe, [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] 000 troops to run a sector in [GPE]. And [ORG] has agreed to help in that sector, help the [NORP] troops. I think that my point to you is [ORG] is becoming more modern, and a more modern [ORG] is going to be very useful for dealing with the true threats that we face in [DATE]. In terms of [ORG], it is going to be important for all of us to work to keep [ORG] a strong and viable institution. And I think a useful dialog at some point in time will be how to make sure [ORG] has adapted to the threats we face. Obviously, it was a frustrating experience to have gone to [ORG] and spent a lot of time and a lot of debate on whether or not [ORG] resolutions should be upheld. I believe they should. I believe in this world, when you say something, you'd better mean it. And I gave the speech, as you might remember, on [DATE], in [ORG], [DATE] after the anniversary of the attacks on our country. And I said to [ORG], You have passed resolution after resolution after resolution I think is said it [CARDINAL] times and my point was, Do you mean it? And my answer in a rhetorical if that is a rhetorical question, my answer to you is, I hope they mean it, because I want [ORG] to be an effective body. However, its effectiveness is undermined when they say something and nothing happens. And therefore, we have got to, all of us who care about [ORG], must figure out how to make it effective in the future. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if you would permit me a couple of detailed questions. [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. Do I need to write these down, because my memory is getting somewhat . [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. I am getting that too. Sir, on the issue of [GPE], it looks like a messy situation. Security is not established. Are you worried about a lengthy [NORP]-British occupation of [GPE]? And on the [NORP] issue [INTERVIEWED]. Let me answer that one first. [INTERVIEWER]. Then will you permit me the [NORP] question? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. And that you admitted you have got a flawed memory like I do. First of all, you made a broad statement, the security situation, as if all of [GPE] is there is lawlessness in all of [GPE]. That is simply not the case. A lot of [GPE] is improving from the pre-war conditions, and that is important to know. Now, there is no question that there is lawlessness inside of [GPE], for example, and regions north of [GPE]. And we are dealing with that. And we will deal with that for the sake of the [NORP] people, who want most first and foremost, to have a secure life, food on the table, lights in their house, running water, sewage that works. They want the conditions of life that everybody yearns for, which is a comfortable lifestyle so their families can be secure. They want to work. And we are making progress on all fronts. I fully understand the degree of difficulty, and it is created by the fact that these people have been enslaved by a torturous ruler for [DATE]. And therefore, I do not expect the conditions to improve automatically after [DATE]. And it is going to take a while. And therefore, to answer your question I do not view it as an occupation, by the way. I view it as a group of nations. You said [NORP] and [NORP]. There are many, many nations who are involved in the contribution of help so that the [NORP] people are able to establish their own Government and have comfortable lives and can be a free society. And it is going to take a while. And I remind you that it is like the writing of the Constitution. [GPE], after our revolution, did not write its Constitution [TIME]. As a matter of fact, it probably took, what, [DATE]. From the Articles of Confederation to the United States Constitution took [DATE]. We live in a world now where everything has to happen [DATE]. Press Secretary [PERSON]. [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. What? Press Secretary [PERSON]. [DATE] [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE]. My man corrected I am sorry. He will not be correcting me much longer. He will be a pundit. Do not worry, he will be correcting me, but on TV. Get him on your TV show. Anyway, [DATE], as my man corrected me. The process will take a while. I am in touch with [PERSON]. I mentioned to you that I will see him when I go over to [GPE]. We get a report all the time. And we are making progress, slowly but surely. And that is and it makes sense, given the conditions. And it is important we succeed. And so, therefore, our coalition of a lot of countries will stay the course, until such time as the [NORP] people the life is improved and the [NORP] people would be in a position to, you know, run themselves. Freedom is going to be a beautiful thing in this part of the world. It is a very powerful sentiment that I believe all people feel. And therefore, [CARDINAL] of our ambitions and [CARDINAL] of our values is to create the conditions necessary for the [NORP] people to run their own Government. And you will see over time here that they will be getting a group of people will be coming together to write a constitution. And you know, it'll be a constitution written by the [NORP], for the [NORP], and of the [NORP]. And we believe that is possible. Now, look, I recognize there are some in the world who say [GPE] cannot run themselves. I refuse to condemn people. I mean, They need a dictatorship in order for the country to survive. Forget it. I do not believe that. It is just not in my makeup. That is just not what I think. I think people I think the [NORP] people are plenty competent about running themselves. It is just going to take a while to go from a society in which [CARDINAL] person dominated and killed and murdered people in order to stay in power. I mean, we have discovered an unbelievable amount of graves. And by the way, we have discovered weapons manufacturing facilities that were condemned by [ORG]; biological laboratories described by our Secretary of [ORG] to the whole world, that were not supposed to be there, in direct violation of the [ORG] resolution, have been discovered. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks for giving me a chance to say that, so the [NORP] press, in particular, could hear it off the record, of course. [ORG]/Middle East Terrorists [INTERVIEWER]. Sir, on the [NORP] issue, what if the government of Mr. [PERSON] really becomes unable no matter how much it puts up an effort to produce eliminating these operations, the suicide bombings what if he fails? Is this a failure of the peace process, of the roadmap? Would you then give it up? And then can you afford, really, sir, to pressure Mr. [PERSON] in a pre-reelection stage? Can you really do that? [INTERVIEWED]. Of course I can. I do not know about listen, if I were afraid of making the decisions necessary, for political reasons, to move the process forward, I would not be going. I believe peace is possible, and I believe that I have a responsibilities, now that the conditions are such, to move the process forward. And what are those conditions? Well, there is a new [NORP] leader who is openly, firmly committed to fighting terror. And I believe he can be successful, particularly when the [NORP] world helps him. I believe the conditions are such that people are so sick and tired of a hopeless situation in that part of the world that together we can defeat the forces of terror and dismantle the forces of terror. That is not to say that a suicider could slip through, and it is possible, but we will not allow the evil designs of a few to stop the process that can provide such hope for a lot of people. So I believe, with the right effort and the right focus and the leadership, not only of [GPE] and [GPE] and [ORG] but the leadership of [GPE] and [GPE] and other nations of concern, [GPE], that we can defeat terror, the forces of terror that would like to stop the process. Yes, ma'am. [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. [INTERVIEWED], you mentioned [DATE] that you want to have commitment from the parties about the peace process. Do you want to have, like, concrete steps? Are you going to ask them for concrete steps, like what? [INTERVIEWED]. Well [INTERVIEWER]. And [INTERVIEWED]. Pardon me, sorry to interrupt you. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. And then in [GPE], what do you want what do you look to get from the [NORP]? And you are meeting with President [PERSON] also. Would it include something bilateral or [INTERVIEWED]. Sure. [INTERVIEWER]. And what kind? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, listen, President [PERSON] and I have had a lot of meetings and a lot of conversations. And I am confident that he will bring up bilateral relations. As you know, we have got a very strong commitment to [GPE], particularly a funding commitment. And we want to look forward to a I will talk to him about economic reforms. And there is no telling what he will talk to me about. We have got such a good relationship that he does not need to pre-clear it with anybody. He can say what is on his mind. I will be glad to visit with him about it. Yes, I mean, first of all, we have a road-map which talks about specific things people need to do. The most constructive thing that the [NORP] nations can do is to stop funding terrorism to the extent that is to stop the funding of terrorism, make sure you get that right is the work to cut off monies to terrorists whose design it is to stop any peace process. And that is important. To me, that is the most fundamental task. Secondly, as conditions improve, it would be very helpful if those in the neighborhood provide financial resources to help the economy of a new [NORP] state begin to grow. It is going to be very difficult for a [NORP] state to emerge unless there is economic activity. I recently met with the finance minister of [ORG], was very impressed by his grasp of finances, by the fact that he believes that in order for there to be confidence amongst the [NORP] and confidence in the world that they have got to fight corruption. Listen, stories used to emerge out of the in [DATE], of [ORG] that much of the aid went to enhance a few, as opposed to the people. And I do not stand for that, at least from [NORP] perspective. We are not going to let corrupt elites take aid that is supposed to go help the people. And so when the institutions evolve and confidence emerges that the develop aid will go to help the [NORP] people, which I want it to do, that will be a useful role for the [NORP] world. And I look forward to working with them on it. But the main thing is for them to see me and my commitment to the process. And it is [CARDINAL] thing to read about it in stories; it is another thing to look a person in the eye and tell them, Let us work together. And that is what I am looking forward to doing. I have got very good relations with President [PERSON] and Crown Prince [PERSON] and the King of [GPE], Gulf Coast countries. I have worked very closely with them. And a lot of them ask me, Well, are you going to move forward now that there is a new [ORG], a leader of [ORG], somebody that you see, the old leader of [ORG] is somebody who had a chance to lead and did not . He has been in power a long time, and the life of the [NORP] people have gotten worse, not better. I remember what happened at [FAC] during the tenure of my predecessor. It was a good lesson. So I have always said, we need to be able to work with somebody who is committed to peace. And I believe the new Prime Minister is committed to peace. And therefore, I want to share that with the leaders. [NORP] Security/Conditions for the Peace Process [INTERVIEWER]. Sir, can you assure that the other party is committed without reservations? [INTERVIEWED]. The [NORP]? Yes, I believe [INTERVIEWER]. Without reservations. It is a big problem to the [NORP] now. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, there is a reservation, and there should be a reservation of all parties, and that is the reservation of security. In other words, people are not going to go forward with a process unless there is a full commitment to enhance the security of all people. And remember, terrorist killers not only affect the security of the [NORP]; they affect the security of the [NORP] people. You cannot have a [NORP] state if people continue to blow up the process. And therefore, it is in all our interest to work together on security. And I am convinced that as the area becomes more secure, as the institutions necessary for a democracy to emerge, that we will have a positive partner in [GPE]. I believe that. I believe they want peace. Most [NORP] understand [CARDINAL] states, side by side in peace, is in their national interest. And so I think the ingredients for peace are very possible. But you say, Are there conditions? You bet. There is conditions, of course. And the conditions are to work together to stop the killers from stopping the process, and I share that condition too. And I suspect a lot of the [NORP] leaders share that condition as well, because they fully understand the consequences of terrorist groups of taking innocent life. Yes, sir. Press Secretary [PERSON]. Make this the last question. [INTERVIEWED]. I will answer shorter. [INTERVIEWER]. All right. So, [DATE] [INTERVIEWED]. Somebody very important, very important is waiting. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. [DATE], [ORG] or [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, it is only [PERSON]. Well, I take it back. Dr. [PERSON]. Your TV people. [INTERVIEWED]. That is later. Later. [INTERVIEWER]. [DATE], the G-7 or [ORG] summit was set up to coordinate the big powers [INTERVIEWED]. It was not [DATE], was it? [CARDINAL] [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] or [INTERVIEWED]. Whatever. [INTERVIEWER]. He will know. Press Secretary [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] point [CARDINAL]. [INTERVIEWER]. Well done. They were set up to coordinate the big powers, the economic strategists. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Given the risk of deflation, will there be such a concerted plan in [GPE]? Or will it be everyone for himself, with the [GPE] capitalizing on the slide of the dollar? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that is a great question. It is very important that we do spend time talking about our respective economies. It is essential that the [ORG] meeting remember why it was first started, because much of it many of the grand goals that we have, together, are very difficult to achieve if the economies, our respective economies, are not strong. You just heard me talk about a hopeful [NORP] state will require trade and commerce. And if the wealthier nations are not generating cashflow and the capacity to be able to trade with other countries, then it is going to be difficult to achieve our goals. And so, absolutely, I will tell them that here at home we are have got sound monetary and fiscal policies. After all, I just signed a tax bill [DATE] that will cut the taxes by [MONEY], which will help energize growth here in [GPE]. I will reiterate our strong dollar policy. I will talk to listen to their plans and initiatives to reform their economies. I had a very good discussion with Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE] about economic matters. We want the [NORP] economy to be strong. As a matter of fact, we want the [NORP] economies to be strong. We want there to be vibrant growth. It is more likely somebody in [GPE] will be able to find a job if our closest trading partners have got vibrant economies. So we need to spend a lot of time on this subject. And I will remind them that we have a great opportunity on the next round of [ORG] to advance a free trade agenda, which I believe will make it more likely people in our respective countries can work. But it will make it more likely that nations will be able to rise out of poverty. And so, yes, it is a very good question. And we will focus on the economy. [GPE]-U.S. Relations [INTERVIEWER]. Just a followup, if I may. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes [INTERVIEWER]. You got rid of the policy that [INTERVIEWED]. I am a patient man. [INTERVIEWER]. reprises against the [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]. My whole family laughed when they heard that. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWER]. You did not exactly answer the question. [INTERVIEWED]. Especially my daughters. I answered the question. I look forward to [INTERVIEWER]. The reprisals on the [NORP]. [INTERVIEWED]. No, I answered it. You see what do you mean, did not exactly answer the question? You have got my answer on your tape machine. [INTERVIEWER]. So were reprisals? [INTERVIEWED]. No, you have got my answer on the tape machine. It is an old trick they use in the [NORP] press corps too, You did not answer my question. What are you talking about? I spent [TIME] answering your question. You might not like the answer but, nevertheless, I did answer it, absolutely answered it. And I loved the question. I look forward to working with the [NORP]. [GPE], [ORG], and [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you visualize [GPE] as a member of [ORG], and in the future, the member of the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that the question on [ORG] is a question that will be answered over time, but first things first. Let us deal with the framework we have now set up, which is a great advance and a tribute to [PERSON] leadership and our [ORG] leader's desire to have a unique relationship with [GPE]. In terms of the [ORG], it is in our national interest that [GPE] join the [ORG]. And [GPE] is going to have to make some internal decisions as to whether or not they are willing to conform to the guidelines of the [ORG]. But we I strongly support [GPE]'s admission in the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, sir. Thank you. Do you see the issue of restitution of [NORP] property as a problem in [NORP] relations? And will you talk about this in [INTERVIEWED]. You know, it has not made it to it has not made it to my desk. And so, therefore, if it is a problem, it is a problem that has not been brought to my attention. In other words, a lot of [NORP] have yet to express themselves to the point where it has become an issue here in [ORG]. I think it is very important let me speak to the broader issue of [NORP] relations around the world. It is very important for all of us to reject anti-Semitism wherever it is found, just like it is very important for us to reject those who condemn [ORG]. Our [ORG] is one that believes in freedom of religion, and we respect and tolerate people's religious faiths, no matter what their faith. And so my greater concern about [ORG] and Europe is that society resist and thwart a culture which would tolerate any kind of antireligious fervor, anti-Semitism, or an [NORP] bent. In other words, one of the things I did I thought was most important was right after September 11th, went to a [NORP] center here. I wanted to send a signal that the evil people who hijacked a great religion should not condemn that religion. In other words, [NORP] should not hold [ORG] accountable for the deaths. And so one of the things we believe here in [GPE] is religious tolerance. And I will continue to speak out on religious tolerances in a clear fashion. As I said, I am going to [FAC] for a reason. I want to go I want to see [FAC]. I have studied a lot of history. I have been told it is a powerful experience. But I also want to send a clear signal that all of us must work together to make sure that kind of evil never happens again to anybody. At any rate, I am looking forward to going. I want to thank you all for your interest. Very good interview. Pass those books over here. 22d Amendment [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. What do you think about a third presidential term in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Against it. I am only supportive of a second term [DATE]. NOTE: The interview was taped at [TIME] on [DATE] in [FAC] at [FAC] for later broadcast. The transcript was released by [ORG] on [DATE]. In his remarks, the President referred to President [PERSON] of [GPE]; Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]; Prime Minister [PERSON] and Finance Minister [PERSON] of [ORG]; President [PERSON] of [GPE]; King [PERSON] of [GPE]; Gen. [PERSON], [GPE], combatant commander, [ORG]; [PERSON], Presidential Envoy to [GPE]; [PERSON] of [GPE]; President [PERSON] of [GPE]; former President [PERSON] of [GPE]; Crown Prince [PERSON] of [GPE]; and Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this interview. [PERSON], Interview With Print Journalists Online by [PERSON] and [PERSON], [ORG]", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprogressivebloggers", "text": "Well, listen, I know we have got limited time, so I am not going to give a long speech on the front end. I thank you guys for coming in. Obviously a huge part of my base reads you guys, cares about what you do. The staff does as well. I think that what the blogosphere has done is to create a conversation that encourages activism across our citizenry, and I think that is absolutely crucial. We benefit from the constructive feedback and criticism that we get, and it helps hold us accountable. But you guys obviously have also done a great job holding the mainstream press accountable, and that is really important to us. So I am glad that I have got time to sit down with you guys. This is completely open, so you guys can take it wherever you want. And what I will do is I will just go down the line, everybody gets a question, and then we can just mix it up. How does that sound? Sounds great. Sounds good? All right. [PERSON], we will start with you. Thanks for having us here, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] . Just to start off, because the news of [DATE] is obviously what just happened in [GPE]. What is your feelings on the thought of a [PERSON] supporter actually stepping on the neck of a female [ORG] supporter? Well, look, I think that one of the things that I have always tried to promote is civility in politics. I think we can disagree vigorously without being disagreeable. And what we saw on the video was an example of people's passions just getting out of hand in ways that are disturbing. In fairness, I do not expect every candidate to be responsible for every single supporter's actions, but I do think that all of us have an obligation to set a tone where we say the other side is - may be wrong but it is not evil, because when you start going down that path of demonizing folks, then these kinds of incidents are more likely to occur. And my expectation in the remainder of this campaign is that all candidates out there are a little more careful about making sure that they are framing the debate around issues and sending a clear message to their supporters that our democracy works when we disagree, we debate, we argue, it gets contentious, but that there are certain lines we do not cross. Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , you have said that you want to work with [NORP] after the election, but there is probably a pretty good chance that they are not going to advance with you. Is there sort of a breaking point you have of where you try to work with them and they just refuse to budge, which they have indicated so far? Is there a breaking point for you just like you are going to have to go off on your own and find a way around them? Look, the - I am a pretty stubborn guy when it comes to, on the [CARDINAL] hand, trying to get cooperation. I do not give up just because I did not get cooperation on this issue; I will try the next issue. If the [NORP] do not agree with me on fiscal policy, maybe they will agree with me on infrastructure. If they do not agree with me on infrastructure, I will try to see if they agree with me on education. So I am just going to keep on trying to see where they want to move the country forward. In that sense, there is not a breaking point for me. There are some core principles that I think are important for not just me to stick with but for the country to stick with. So if the [NORP] say we need to cut our investments in education, at a time when we know that our success as a nation is largely going to depend on how well trained our workforce is, I am going to say no. And there are going to be areas where, after working very hard, we just cannot find compromise and I am going to be standing my ground, then essentially we debate it before the [NORP] people. But I do not go into [DATE] assuming that there is just going to be gridlock. We are going to keep on working to make sure that we can get as much done as possible because folks are hurting out there. What they are looking for is help on jobs, help on keeping their homes, help on sending their kids to college. And if I can find ways for us to work with [NORP] to advance those issues, then that is going to be my priority. Along those lines, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , on the economy, we do have [CARDINAL] unemployment; economic projections are not looking very positive from anybody, with the ongoing foreclosure crisis, as you suggested. Can we expect further initiatives coming out of the administration and maybe [ORG] post-election? Absolutely. We cannot stop. A concern I have right now is that the main economic idea that the [NORP] seem to have is continuing the tax cuts for the top [PERCENT], and then a vague statement about cutting spending without identifying what those spending cuts might actually be. And I do not know any economists who would say that is a recipe for more job creation. We have to deal with our debt and we have to deal with our deficits in a responsible way. As you know, most of the problem with our debt and deficits is structural and has to do with the medium and long term. So my hope is, is that we can find a sensible way to deal with it that does not squelch economic growth, because a single-point increase in economic growth actually has as much impact on the debt and deficits as all of the [PERSON] tax cuts. I mean, it is [MONEY] over the life of the economy. And so we have got to emphasize economic growth. Now, we were successful in reversing our descent into a depression. The Recovery Act worked in stopping the freefall. We followed up with that with everything from a package to cut taxes for small businesses to providing additional assistance to states so that they could keep teachers and firefighters and police officers on the job. I have already put forward proposals for infrastructure, which I think can have a huge long-term ramification - putting people back to work right now, doing the work that [GPE] needs done, laying the foundation for long-term competitiveness. I think that there may be additional ideas that traditionally have garnered some bipartisan support that we can move forward on. But the point that you are making I think is really important. Yes, people are concerned about debt and deficit. But the single thing people are most concerned about are jobs. And those jobs are going to come from the private sector. We are not going to be able to fill the hole of [CARDINAL] jobs that were lost as a consequence of the economic crisis just through government spending, but we can strategically help jumpstart industries. We can make a difference on clean energy. We can make a difference on getting businesses to invest in [DATE] as opposed to deferring until [DATE] or [DATE] or [DATE]. And there should be ways that we can come to some agreement with [NORP] if their focus is in fact on improving the lives of the [NORP] people as opposed to just positioning for the next election. Mine is an easy question. Will you rule out raising the retirement age to [DATE]? We are awaiting a report from the deficit commission, or deficit reduction commission, so I have been adamant about not prejudging their work until we get it. But I think you can look at the statements that I have made in the past, including when I was campaigning for the presidency, that [ORG] is something that can be fixed with some modest modifications that do not impose hardships on beneficiaries who are counting on it. And so the example that I used during the campaign was an increase in the payroll tax, not an increase - let me scratch that. Not an increase in the payroll tax but an increase in the income level at which it is excluded. And so what I have been clear about is, is that I have got a set of preferences, but I want the commission to go ahead and do its work. When it issues its report, I am not automatically going to assume that it is the right way to do things. I will study it and examine it and see what makes sense. But I have said in the past, I will say here now, it does not strike me that a steep hike in the retirement age is in fact the best way to fix [ORG]. Thank you. I was glad to hear that you and your staff appreciate constructive feedback. Yes, that is something we enjoy. We have been more than willing to offer that. We have certainly been more than willing to offer than from [ORG], particularly on issues related to the LGBT community, which, you know, there is a certain amount of disillusionment and disappointment in our community right now. And [CARDINAL] of the things I'd like to ask you - and I think it is a simple yes or no question too - is do you think that do not ask, do not tell is unconstitutional? It is not a simple yes or no question, because I am not sitting on [ORG]. And I have got to be careful, as [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE], to make sure that when I am making pronouncements about laws that [ORG] passed I do not do so just off the top of my head. I think that - but here is what I can say. I think do not ask, do not tell is wrong. I think it does not serve our national security, which is why I want it overturned. I think that the best way to overturn it is for [ORG] to act. In theory, we should be able to get [CARDINAL] votes out of the [ORG]. The [ORG] has already passed it. And I have gotten the Secretary of [ORG] and the Chairman of [ORG] to say that they think this policy needs to be overturned - something that is unprecedented. And so my hope and expectation is, is that we get this law passed. It is not just harmful to the brave men and women who are serving, and in some cases have been discharged unjustly, but it does not serve our interests - and I speak as Commander-in-Chief on that issue. Let me go to the larger issue, though, [PERSON], about disillusionment and disappointment. I guess my attitude is that we have been as vocal, as supportive of the LGBT community as any [INTERVIEWED] in history. I have appointed more openly gay people to more positions in this government than any [INTERVIEWED] in history. We have moved forward on a whole range of issues that were directly under my control, including, for example, hospital visitation. On do not ask, do not tell, I have been as systematic and methodical in trying to move that agenda forward as I could be given my legal constraints, given that [ORG] had explicitly passed a law designed to tie my hands on the issue. And so, I will be honest with you, I do not think that the disillusionment is justified. Now, I say that as somebody who appreciates that the LGBT community very legitimately feels these issues in very personal terms. So it is not my place to counsel patience. One of my favorite pieces of literature is Letter from Birmingham Jail, and Dr. [PERSON] had to battle people counseling patience and time. And he rightly said that time is neutral. And things do not automatically get better unless people push to try to get things better. So I do not begrudge the LGBT community pushing, but the flip side of it is that this notion somehow that this administration has been a source of disappointment to the LGBT community, as opposed to a stalwart ally of the LGBT community, I think is wrong. All right, now, at this point we can just open it up. I just wanted to make sure everybody got [CARDINAL] question, and then you guys can - I have one. [PERSON] and Liars, we are very proactive for the [NORP] community and rights, for immigration reform. And you have just gone on [NORP] radio and said how we need comprehensive immigration reform. I guess I have [CARDINAL] points. [CARDINAL] is, will you - how far will you go on helping to get the DREAM Act passed? Because it is very important. And also - and it is been mentioned in these questions - with the conservative movement not governing to us appears - as far as helping the [NORP] people more on ideology - how do you expect or hope to get conservatives onboard with truly doing immigration reform? Well, look, this is a challenge. I mean, right now, I will be honest, we are closer to getting the votes for do not ask, do not tell than we are for getting the votes for comprehensive immigration reform. That is a reversal from [DATE] when you had [PERSON] and [PERSON] cosponsoring comprehensive immigration reform. The center of gravity within [ORG] has shifted. And so out of the [CARDINAL] [NORP] who are still in the [ORG] who voted for comprehensive immigration reform, I do not know that any of them came out in favor publicly of comprehensive immigration reform during the course of [DATE]. And that is a problem, because unfortunately we now have essentially a [CARDINAL]-vote requirement on every single issue, including trying to get judges confirmed who've passed through [ORG] on a unanimous basis. Having said that, I think the logic behind comprehensive immigration reform is sufficiently compelling that if we are making the case forcefully - that we have increased border security, we have more [ORG] down on the border than we have ever had before, we have got more resources being devoted to enforcement than before - and yet the problem continues, that means that we have got to try something different. And that involves, on the [CARDINAL] hand, being serious about border security, but it also involves being serious about employers and making sure that they are not exploiting undocumented workers, and it means getting the [CARDINAL] people who are in the shadows out of the shadows and giving them an opportunity to get right by the law so that we can create an orderly process in which this is still a nation of immigrants and it is a nation of laws. So I am going to keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. It is going to continue to be a priority of my administration. I am going to try to make the case to [NORP] and to the [NORP] people that it is the right thing to do. The DREAM Act is [CARDINAL] component of it that I have been a strong supporter of. I was a sponsor - a cosponsor of the DREAM Act when I was in the [ORG], and what I told [PERSON] when I was on his radio show, and what I have said repeatedly, is that my strong preference is to do a comprehensive piece of legislation. But I am going to consult with immigrants' rights groups and [ORG]. If they see an opportunity for us to get the DREAM Act and they think this is something we should go ahead and do now and that it does not endanger the possibilities of getting comprehensive immigration reform, the other components of it, down the road, then that is something I will consider. But my goal right now is to do a broader approach that allows everybody to get out of the shadows, paying their taxes, and contributing to our society. Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , you are often pressured from both the left and right on [CARDINAL] issue or another, and then even within [ORG] you get pressured from the more conservative, more progressive side of the party. So I am curious, you sort of govern as a - sort of as a pragmatist, and I am wondering if you view yourself as a progressive. Well, I mean, the problem with labels is everybody thinks they mean different things. So I would define myself as a strong progressive in the sense that I believe in that essential [NORP] Dream that everybody gets a chance to make it if they are willing to work hard, that government has a role to play in ensuring opportunity by making sure kids get a decent education and can afford to go to college; that workers are able to train and retrain for the jobs of the future; that we are building strong infrastructure; that we are using our diplomacy alongside our military to protect our national security; that we believe in the Bill of Rights and we actually act on it, even when it is inconvenient; that we are promoting the equal treatment of citizens under the law. Those core beliefs that [GPE] prospers not just when a few people do well but when everybody has the chance to do well, when we have got a growing middle class, where we - people are able to live out their dreams without the barriers of race or gender or sexual orientation, those are things I deeply believe in. In that sense, though, I think [PERSON] was a progressive. He was a [NORP]. He was the first [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] . And that just gives you a sense of how these categories change so much. It used to be that the values I just described had a home in [ORG] as well as [ORG]. I think it is only been in [DATE] that you cannot find that articulation of some of these values in [ORG], and that in fact if you champion them that you are considered some wild-eyed radical. That is a shift, and not a good shift, in terms of our public debate. I was wondering if you are happy with the federal response to the foreclosure crisis or if you think there is more that either should have been or could be in the future done either through [ORG] or [ORG] and [ORG] or various mechanisms? I do not think I am happy with [CARDINAL] of foreclosures or [CARDINAL] of houses being underwater. This is - this was both a powerful symptom as well as a cause of the economic crisis that we are in. So we have got to do as much as we can to stabilize the housing market. I do think that the steps that we have taken helped stabilize the housing market. The [ORG] program has gotten a lot of criticism, but the fact of the matter is, is that you have got [CARDINAL] people who have gone through permanent loan modifications that are saving [MONEY] a month. And I get letters [DATE] from people whose homes were saved as a consequence of it. I think that the broader steps we took to stabilize the economy mean that housing prices are not plummeting the way they were. But this is a [MONEY] market and a [MONEY] problem. And the challenge that we have had is we have got only so much gravel and we have got a really big pothole. We cannot magically sort of fix a decline in home values that is so severe in some markets that people are [MONEY], 000 underwater. What we can do is to try to create sort of essentially bridge programs that help people stabilize, refinance where they can, and in some cases not just get pummeled if they decide that they want to move. I think that we have tinkered with the HAMP program as we get more information to figure out can we do this better, can we do this smarter with the resources that we have. The biggest challenge is how do you make sure that you are helping those who really deserve help and if they get some temporary help can get back on their feet, make their payments and move forward and stay in their home, versus either people who are speculators, own second homes that they really could not afford because they'd gotten a subprime loan, and people who through no fault of their own just cannot afford their house anymore because of the change in housing values or their incomes do not support it. And we are always trying to find that sweet spot to use as much of the money that we have available to us to help those who can be helped, without wasting that money on folks who do not deserve help. And that is a tough balance to strike. I had a meeting with [PERSON] in my office and his basic point was there was a lot of over-building for a long period of time. Now there is under-building because all that backlog of inventory is being absorbed. Some of that is just going to take time. And we can do as much as we can to help ease that transition, but we are not going to be able to eliminate all the pain because we just do not have the resources to do it. The market is just too big. The other aspect of the housing market that is worth bearing in mind is that whereas initially a lot of the problems on the foreclosure front had to do with balloon payments people did not see coming, adjustable rate mortgages that people did not clearly understand, predatory lending scams that were taking place - now the biggest driver of foreclosure is unemployment. And so the single most important thing I can do for the housing market is actually improve economic growth as a whole. If we can get the economy moving stronger, if we can drive the unemployment rate down, that will have probably the biggest impact on foreclosures, as well as housing prices, as just about anything. I want to go back to the idea of working with [NORP]. And given the comments from [PERSON] and - well, all of them - I think that what a lot of people find frustrating is that our side compromises and continues to compromise just to get that [CARDINAL] [NORP] on. We are going to get [CARDINAL] of the [GPE] twins - whatever. And it does not happen, and then by the time health care or whatever goes through we have compromised; we still do not get any [NORP]. I do not anticipate this changing in [DATE]. I think it is going to get worse. How are you going to get [NORP] to understand that compromise means the other side has to give something sometimes, [DATE]? Look, obviously I share your frustrations. I have got to deal with this [DATE]. Well, I do not expect you to talk like a blogger. [laughter] But I guess I'd make [CARDINAL] points. The first is, I am [INTERVIEWED] and not king. And so I have got to get a majority in the [ORG] and I have got to get [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG] to move any legislative initiative forward. Now, during the course - [DATE] of my presidency so far, I think we had [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG] for [DATE] [CARDINAL]? I mean, it was after [PERSON] finally got seated and [PERSON] had flipped, but before [PERSON] won in [GPE]. So that is a fairly narrow window. So we are right at the number, and that presumes that there is uniformity within the [NORP] caucus in the [ORG] - which, [PERSON], you have been around a while. You know that not every [NORP] in the [NORP] caucus agrees with me or agrees with each other in terms of complicated issues like health care. So it is important for me, then, to work every angle I can to get as much done as I can. If we had a parliamentary system, then this critique would make sense to me because you do as much as you can to negotiate with the other side, but at a certain point you have got your platform and you move it forward and your party votes for it. But that is not the system of government we have. We have got a different system. I will say that the damage that the filibuster I think has done to the workings of our democracy are at this point pretty profound. The rate at which it is used just to delay and obstruct is unprecedented. But that is the reality right now. So I guess my answer is that there has not been, I think, any issue that we have worked in which I have been willing to sign on to a compromise that I did not feel was a strong improvement over the status quo and was not the best that we could do, given the political alignments that we have got. And, yes, it leaves some folks dissatisfied. I understand that. But let us take the health care bill. As frustrated and angry and dispirited as the base might have been - we did not have a public option, and it just dragged on for such a long time, and you are having conversations with [PERSON], even though it turns out [PERSON] has no interest in actually getting something done - all the complaints which I was obviously very familiar with, the fact of the matter is, is that we got a piece of legislation through that we have been waiting [DATE] to get through; that in the aggregate sets up a system in which [CARDINAL] people are going to get health insurance; in which we have got an exchange that forces insurance companies to compete with a pool of [CARDINAL] and will be policed so that they cannot jack up prices; that pool has purchasing power that they have never had before; that you have got a patient's bill of rights that was the hallmark, sort of the high-water mark of what progressives thought we could do in the health care field - we got that whole thing basically just as part of the bill. You have got investments in community health centers and preventive medicine and research that is going to help improve our health care delivery systems as a whole. And we can build on that. And I know this analogy has been used before, but when [ORG] was passed, it was for widows and orphans. And a whole bunch of folks were not included in it. But that building block, the foundation stone, ended up creating one of the most important safety nets that we have. And I think the same thing is going to happen with health care. I think when you look at financial regulatory reform, there is been a whole bunch of debates about where that could have gone and how it could have gone. And there are folks in the progressive community who complain we should have broken up the banks, or the derivatives law should have been structured this way rather than that way. But the truth of the matter is, is that this is a incredibly powerful tool. You have got [ORG] that that can save consumers [MONEY] - is already saving folks [MONEY] just by having it passed. Already you are starting to see negotiations in terms of how mortgage folks operate, in terms of how credit card companies operate. You have got capital requirements that are being imposed on banks and other financial institutions that are much higher than they were before, which creates a cushion against the kind of too-big-to-fail that we have seen in the past. You have got derivatives markets that are now being forced into open clearinghouses and markets so people know exactly what is going on. You have got [PERSON] rule that some people did not think it was strong enough, but basically prohibits some of the proprietary trading that helped to create this market in securitized subprime loans that helped to trigger this disaster. So in each of these cases, this glass is not full, but it is got a lot of water in it. And so I guess my point is that on all these debates, my constant calculation has been, are we better off going ahead and getting this done? Or are we - is it better for us to have a fight that may end up being symbolically satisfying but means that we lose because we just do not have enough votes. And I will give you [CARDINAL] last example because I know this is a famous example in the blogosphere, is the stimulus. I mean, if folks think that we could have gotten [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON] to vote for additional stimulus beyond the [MONEY] that we got, then I would just suggest you were not in the meetings. This notion that somehow I could have gone and made the case around the country for a far bigger stimulus because of the magnitude of the crisis, well, we understood the magnitude of the crisis. We did not actually, I think, do what [PERSON] did, which was basically wait for [DATE] until the thing had gotten so bad that it became an easier sell politically because we thought that was irresponsible. We had to act quickly. And getting [CARDINAL] votes for what was an unprecedented stimulus was really hard. And we did not have the luxury of saying - first of all, we did not have [CARDINAL] votes at the time. We had [CARDINAL]. And we did not have the luxury to say to the [ORG], our way or the highway on this one. So we did what we could in an emergency situation, anticipating that we were going to have to do more and hoping that we could continue to do more as time went on. So I have another gay question. [laughter] It is okay, man. And this one is on the issue of marriage. Since you have become [INTERVIEWED] , a lot has changed. More states have passed marriage equality laws. [DATE] a federal judge declared DOMA unconstitutional in [CARDINAL] different cases. A judge in [GPE] declared Prop 8 was unconstitutional. And I know during the campaign you often said you thought marriage was the union between a man and a woman, and there - like I said, when you look at public opinion polling, it is heading in the right direction. We have actually got [NORP] like [PERSON] and even [PERSON] on our side now. So I just really want to know what is your position on same-sex marriage? [PERSON], I do not intend to make big news sitting here with the [CARDINAL] of you, as wonderful as you guys are. [laughter] But I will say this - I just want to say, I would be remiss if I did not ask you this question. Of course. People in our community are really desperate to know. I think it is a fair question to ask. I think that - I am a strong supporter of civil unions. As you say, I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage. But I also think you are right that attitudes evolve, including mine. And I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents. And I care about them deeply. And so while I am not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in [FAC] at [TIME], I think it is fair to say that it is something that I think a lot about. That is probably the best you will do out of me [DATE]. It is an important issue, and I think that - I think it is an entirely fair question to ask. And part of it is that you cannot be equal in this country if the very core of who you are as a person and the love - the person you love is not - if that relationship is not the same as everybody else's, then we are not equal. And I think that a lot of - particularly in the wake of the [GPE] election on Prop 8, a lot of gay people realized we are not equal. And I think that that is - that is been part of the change in the - Prop 8, which I opposed. Right. I remember you did. You sent the letter and that was great. I think that the level of intensity in the LGBT community changed after we lost rights in that election. And I think that is a lot of where the community is right now. The [CARDINAL] thing I will say [DATE] is I think it is pretty clear where the trend lines are going. The arc of history. The arc of history. Anything else? Well, can I ask you just about do not ask, do not tell, just following up? I just want to follow up. Because you mentioned it - Yes, sure. Go ahead. Is there a strategy for the lame-duck session to - Yes. - and you are going to be involved? Yes. Will Secretary [PERSON] be involved? I am not going to tip my hand now. But there is a strategy. Okay. And, look, as I said - Can we call it a secret plan? I was very deliberate in working with the [ORG] so that I have got the Secretary of [ORG] and the Chairman of [ORG] being very clear about the need to end this policy. That is part of a strategy that I have been pursuing since I came into office. And my hope is that will culminate in getting this thing overturned before [DATE]. Now, as usual, I need [CARDINAL] votes. So I think that, [PERSON], the folks that you need to be having a really good conversation with - and I had that conversation with them directly [DATE], but you may have more influence than I do - is making sure that all those [ORG] [NORP] who helped to finance this lawsuit and who feel about this issue so passionately are working the handful of [NORP] that we need to get this thing done. Yes, I do not have that relationship with them. [laughter] But, I mean, it is just - I do not understand the logic of it. Nor do I. You are financing a very successful, very effective legal strategy, and yet the only really thing you need to do is make sure that we get [CARDINAL] [NORP] votes in the [ORG]. And I said directly to the [ORG] [NORP] who was here [DATE], I said, that cannot be that hard. Get me those votes. Because what I do anticipate is that [PERSON] and maybe some others will filibuster this issue, and we are going to have to have a cloture vote. If we can get through that cloture vote, this is done. On that same issue, because a lot of progressives - and you said you are not the king - well, a lot of progressives feel that senators, especially in the minority they think - we call them [ORG]. And are you in favor of any form of filibuster reform? Because there are several bills being talked about. And there is a unique time that - by the way, we are also very happy that Vice [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] went down to do a fundraiser for [PERSON]. He is the type of [NORP] that speaks out and fights. And that is what the progressive community really likes. But he also might have the opportunity in [DATE] to be - to help out. And can we get - or are you for any of the bills that are out there to support - to change this rule that is paralyzing the administration? Well, I have got to be careful about not looking like I am big-footing [ORG]. We have got separate branches of government. The [ORG] and the [ORG] have their own rules. And they are very protective of those prerogatives. I will say that as just an observer of our political process that if we do not fix how the filibuster is used in the [ORG], then it is going to be very difficult for us over the long term to compete in a very fast moving global environment. What keeps me up at [TIME] is [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] - they are moving. They make decisions, we are going to pursue clean energy, and the next thing you know they have cornered [CARDINAL] the clean energy market; we are going to develop high-speed rail in [DATE] - suddenly they have got high-speed rail lines going; we are going to promote exports, here is what we are going to do - boom, they get going. And if we cannot sort of execute on key issues that will determine our competitiveness over the long term, we are going to fall behind - we are going to fall behind. And the filibuster is not part of the Constitution. The filibuster, if you look at the history of it, may have arisen purely by accident because somebody did not properly apply Robert's Rules of Procedure and forgot to get a provision in there about what was required to close debate. And folks figured out very early, this could be a powerful tool. It was used as a limited tool throughout its history. Sadly, the primary way it was used was to prevent [NORP] from achieving civil rights. But setting aside that sordid aspect of its history, it was used in a very limited fashion. The big debates, the big changes that we had historically around everything from establishing public schools to the moon launch to [ORG], they were not subject to the filibuster. And I am sympathetic to why the minority wants to keep it. And in fairness, [NORP], when we were in the minority, used it on occasion to blunt actions that we did not think were appropriate by the [PERSON] administration. On occasion. And in fairness, there were a whole bunch of folks here who were already writing blogs at the time who were saying, filibuster, block them, do anything you can to stop them. And so if we are going to call for reform, it is got to be with open eyes and an understanding that that also means that if [NORP] are in power, it is easier for them to move their agendas forward. But my general view is, what that does at least is it opens it up to serious public debate. Things do not get bogged down in the kinds of procedural nonsense that makes it just hard for us to do business. I mean, during the financial crisis, [CARDINAL] my [ORG] slots were not filled - could not get them filled. And this is a time when we were worried that the entire financial system was melting down. So that is - I believe it is something that we have got to take seriously. All right? [PERSON]: We need to get you to your next event, sir. Thank you, guys. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Appreciate it. We will do it again. Thanks a lot. All right. Thank you. How about the game [TIME]? Which one? Oh, the Series? The Series. You know, let me not wade into this one. [laughter] I think it is fun. But [ORG] are not in it, so I just want a [CARDINAL] game. But I have got to say, [PERSON] looks like a pretty tough pitcher. [applause]", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithradioreporters", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I want to thank all of you for coming [DATE] and for offering all of us this opportunity to have a conversation with the radio listeners around the country and beyond. I thought I would open just by saying that I have sent a letter [TIME] to Senator [PERSON] in the [ORG] about some potential amendments to the defense appropriation bill and [CARDINAL] actual amendment dealing with [GPE], [GPE], and the whole command and control apparatus of our military as it relates to cooperation with other countries in peacekeeping and other endeavors. That amendment has actually been introduced. The letter essentially says that I oppose the amendment that affects the way our military people do their business, working with [ORG] and other military allies. I think it unduly gets into the details of the command and control operations of the military, which I think is an error, and that I would oppose any amendments with regard to [GPE] and [GPE] that were of questionable constitutionality and unduly restricted the ability of the [INTERVIEWED] to make foreign policy, and outlines some of my concerns. In [GPE], my concerns are that there should be no restrictions that would undermine the ability of the [INTERVIEWED] to protect the [NORP] on [GPE], that would aggravate the likelihood of another mass exodus of [NORP], or that would send a green light to the people who think they have got the best of both worlds: they got the sanctions lifted, and then they broke their word on the Governors Island Agreement. With regard to [GPE], the amendment simply points out that [GPE] has very strong [ORG] allies and that there were strict conditions that I have put on any kind of cooperation in [GPE] with [ORG] to enforce a peace agreement and that I think most Members of [ORG] agree with those conditions, but I do not think we should have an amendment which would tie the [INTERVIEWED]'s hands and make us unable to fulfill our [ORG] commitments, thus raising all kinds of questions about the longterm relationship of [GPE] to Europe. So that is what the letter says. There is [CARDINAL] amendment so far that has been offered, and we are discussing with various Members of [ORG] other proposed amendments. We will just have to see what happens. But I thought I ought to say clearly [DATE] that I would strenuously oppose such attempts to encroach on the [INTERVIEWED]'s foreign policy powers. Now we can go to the questions. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. Your opening statement raises the question of whether [GPE] would be willing to use military force for the purpose of removing the military leadership from [GPE] and reinstalling [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] in power. [INTERVIEWED]. Let me tell you what I have done [DATE] on [GPE], first of all. I just signed the Executive order freezing the assets of any people who are supporting the military and police leaders who have continued to fight the resumption of democracy and who are responsible for the bad things that have happened down there in [DATE]. I have also, with the authorization of the [NORP] government, directed our ships in the area to move closer to the shore so they will be in plain sight. And that has been done [DATE]. I think we should continue to work with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and with Prime Minister [PERSON]. They want to go back to the sanctions. Remember, once the sanctions were tough, and they included oil, they produced the Governors Island Agreement. And what happened is that people who have an economic stranglehold on [GPE] got what they wanted with [PERSON]'s request, that is, lifting the sanctions. They got the amnesty that [PERSON] promised, they thought he would never give. And then, when time came for them to deliver what they agreed to do, they did not do it. So I think the appropriate position for us to take at this time is to go back to those sanctions and make them as tough as possible and enforce them as completely as possible. And that is what the Prime Minister wants us to do and what [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] has asked us to do. I think it would be an error for me to discuss what further steps might or might not be taken. After all, we do have-I will say again, we have [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [NORP] there, and we have another [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people with dual citizenship, and we'd have no way of knowing what will or will not happen. But what the [NORP] want is for the conditions of legitimacy to be maintained and restored. That is, the [NORP] people have expressed their desires; [CARDINAL] of them voted for [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. And in terms of the questions that have been raised again in [DATE] about whether he could or could not govern the country, that is why he worked so hard with our support to get Mr. [PERSON], who plainly can run the government, as [CARDINAL] of the ablest people in the nation to be the Prime Minister so they'd have the kind of partnership that would work. So I feel comfortable that they are capable of working with their friends and allies in the area to bring about a more democratic and a more prosperous [GPE] if given the chance. Health Care Reform [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], economists are expressing some concern of late about your health care reform plan and about whether it might grow considerably larger than you envision. What assurances can you give the [NORP] public that it either will not grow out of control or that the need for universal health care is worth it ballooning to the size of, say, [ORG] and [ORG], which are [CARDINAL] times larger than originally predicted? [INTERVIEWED]. First of all, let me say that it is not a Government program. The Government will only insure the unemployed uninsured. [CARDINAL] of the funding for this program will come from employers and the employees who do not presently contribute anything to the [NORP] health care system. Secondly, where have these economists been for [DATE]? I mean, the [NORP] health care system is already [PERCENT] more expensive than any other one in the world and the only advanced health care system in the world that cannot seem to figure out how to provide coverage to everybody while spending [PERCENT] more than anybody else spends. The budget we just passed in this Government has [ORG] and [ORG] going up at [CARDINAL] times the rate of inflation. We proposed to reduce that in our bill. We have also ceilings on how much health care expenditures can increase in [DATE] if the competition does not cut the costs. Now, if you look around the country at the places which have tried serious efforts at managed competition, including bringing the [ORG] program into a competitive arena, there is every indication that the rate of increase will slow down and that it will work. But the economists, they seem to want it all ways. They criticize me on the [CARDINAL] hand for having a ceiling on how much costs could increase in [DATE] and then saying we do not have any guarantees, if you take it off they will not increase more. And it is difficult to imagine how we could design a system that would have costs more out of control than the one we have. I mean, the reason we have so much support here from employers in heavy industry, for example, who already cover their employees is that they are being killed by the cost increases. The system we have is irresponsible and out of control financially, and does not provide health care security to [NORP]. So we think there are plenty of protections built in to slow the rate of increase in costs. In fact, if anything, I think we have been certainly realistic and then some, in estimating how fast we can slow costs down. That is, even under our plan, it is estimated that the percent of our income going to health care will go from [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] by [DATE], and that if we just stay with the system we have got, which is the alternative-in all these things, you have got to ask what is the alternative-we will go from [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] by [DATE]. We have allowed and budgeted for significant increased expenses in health care. [NORP] Criticism [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in [DATE] or so you and your foreign policy team have come in for some pretty blistering criticism, especially from a group of prominent [NORP]. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON] have all been very, very critical of your foreign policy. And some members of your administration have suggested that is politically motivated, these people might be running for [INTERVIEWED]. What do you make of it, and how do you react to those criticisms? [INTERVIEWED]. I think you can monitor their travel schedules and statements as well as I can. I do not have anything to say about that. I am going to do my job as best I can. I am going to try to support a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. I am going to try to involve [NORP] and [NORP] in the process of consultation and getting as good advice as I can all the way along. And I think that you have to expect that when things go very well, as they did with [GPE] and the Middle East, people will say you are doing fine, and if difficulties arise, then some will say that you did not do fine. So I just do not want to get into the politics of it. If you want to talk about any specific policy in any specific country, I will do my best to answer that. But I think it serves no useful purpose for me to engage any of them in this sort of debate. Whatever the political motivations are, I have a contract that runs for a specific amount of time. I am going to do the very best I can during that time, and then when the time is up the [NORP] people can make their own judgments. I have not even been [INTERVIEWED] [DATE]. I do not have any interest in starting a political debate now. Administration Goals [INTERVIEWER]. Even though it is been [DATE], Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it is been a very ambitious Presidency with a lot of projects you have taken on yourself, health care reform, reinventing Government, national service, things you inherited like [GPE], [GPE] in a way, [ORG]. Is there ever coming a point, is there now a point that you just have to say, enough is enough for now, the plate is too full, we have to resolve some of these things before we get on with other things? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. And we have taken that position. I mean, first of all, if you go back to the budget, we kept the budget front and center until that was resolved. And it plainly has worked rather well. Long-term interest rates are still below [PERCENT]. The budget did some remarkable things. It dramatically broadened the availability of college loans to students, and it has the most significant piece of tax reform for working families in [DATE] by increasing the earned-income tax credit, so that all working families on modest incomes with children will know they will be lifted above the Federal poverty lines. That is a lot to accomplish in [DATE] right there. The national service bill passed, and very well, and of course, a number of other pieces of legislation have. And now, what we are going to focus on [DATE] is making as much headway as we can on the first round of reinventing Government cuts, on the crime bill, on the political reform initiatives that some of which have passed the [ORG] already, the campaign finance reform and lobby reform bill, and on getting the health care bill heard and setting schedules there so we will know that it will be reviewed along with all other ideas in a prompt and timely fashion, and we will be able to see as we wind up here a process which unfolds [DATE] and brings us to a datecertain vote. But we do have a lot going. We probably had more done [DATE] than in [DATE] in a long time, and there is still a lot more to do. For example, we started our welfare reform task force hearings around the country, but I do not intend to offer any legislation on that until [DATE]. And there will be a lot of other things that will come up as we go along [DATE]. We want, for example, to change the whole unemployment system, as you know, to a reemployment system. We do not think that will be offered until [DATE], to give the [NORP] people a system of lifetime education and training. I do hope that we can pass as many bills as possible [DATE]. I was heartened by the fact that the [ORG] passed our education reform bill, the Goals 2000 bill, with such a big bipartisan majority [DATE], which made me think we could probably pass that bill completely before the [ORG] goes home [DATE]. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it is coming up on [DATE] since the end of [GPE] and the declaration by the remaining states to call themselves democracies or create democracies. Secretary [PERSON] is headed over there. Can you tell us what the objective of his trip is? Will he be looking to set up a summit meeting? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, there is a possibility, of course, that [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and I will meet again [DATE]; I have to go to Europe to the [ORG] summit. But primarily, what he wants to do is to convey the continuing support of [GPE] for democracy and reform in [GPE], to urge the [PERSON] administration on in their efforts to complete the timetable to get a new constitution and to have legislative elections and to restore completely the conditions of democracy in [GPE], and to review the progress on the [NORP] aid package, both the ones, the [CARDINAL] passed by [ORG] [ORG] here with strong bipartisan support and the international package that came out of the G-7 summit. And so he will be doing all those things. And I am sure they will review some of the difficulties in that part of the world, too. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] also has his share of foreign policy problems that he cannot fully solve. But we will talk about that. We are interested very much in some of those things. Especially we'd like to see the last [NORP] troops withdrawn from [GPE] and [GPE], as they have been from [GPE]. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], if we could return to the [GPE] issue for [TIME]. Senator [PERSON] said he did not think it was worth any [NORP] lives to restore [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. You indicated you did not want to go too far into options. But are there conditions beyond, say, a direct physical threat to the [ORG] compound in [GPE] under which you would consider committing [GPE] troops to [GPE]? For example, attacks or killings of foreigners, a flow of refugees, or maybe just threats against foreigners? Are there any conditions for sending [GPE] troops? [INTERVIEWED]. I just think at this time it is better for me not to rule in or out options. Keep in mind, [ORG], as we speak, has not asked for that and does not want that. And keep in mind that the sanctions did work once before to get this agreement, which was not honored perhaps because we raised the sanctions, we lifted the sanctions. But let me remind you that the circumstances of this need to be focused on. [GPE] is very much in our backyard. The people wanted democracy. There is the continuing issue of whether there would be another exodus of [NORP] trying to come to [GPE], something which I think is not in their interest or ours but is something that the present conditions could make more likely. And we do have those [NORP] there. So what I want to do [DATE] is to encourage Prime Minister [PERSON] and the brave people who are in his government and the good people of [GPE] who plainly want democracy and are being pushed around by the only guys in town with guns, which I regret very much. But we are trying to preserve the legitimacy of democracy there. Now, the truth is, as you know, there are people in this country, in the press, and in the [ORG] and elsewhere, who, notwithstanding the vote of the [NORP] people, basically have never felt very strongly about returning [PERSON] anyway and have questioned his fitness to be [INTERVIEWED]. You can do that with the winner of any election. But all I can tell you is that I would just like to observe just a couple of things. Number [CARDINAL] is, unlike his adversaries, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] has done everything he said he would do under the Governors Island Agreement, including giving them amnesty. And secondly, recognizing his lack of experience in politics and business, he reached out to a man like [PERSON], who is plainly one of the ablest people in the country and clearly a very stable and reassuring figure, asking him to run the government. So I feel that we should support the democratic movement in [GPE]. And I think that the steps we are taking now are the appropriate ones. Assistant Attorney General [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], have you decided on a nominee for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not want to give you an evasive answer, but let me tell you what happened. We had, [DATE], a nominee who declined the position for personal reasons. And [ORG] was asked, the Attorney General specifically was asked, to make another recommendation. I believe that she has a recommendation for me which I have not yet formally received. But I am not positive of that, but I believe so. Gun Control Legislation [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I'd like to ask you about a subject that you have brought up in a number of your remarks lately. You have been discussing the issue of gun control, firearms violence, the extremely high cost of health care related to firearm injuries. Senator [PERSON] of [GPE] has once again introduced legislation which is pending in [ORG] now which would ban the sale, manufacture, possession, importation, or exportation of all handguns with exceptions for law enforcement, military, and licensed target clubs. You have talked about your support for the Brady bill and for a ban on assault weapons. How would you feel about Senator [PERSON]'s bill, which I understand Dr. [PERSON], former [ORG] Secretary, is testifying on [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have to read it, but I think it might go a little far if it bans all handguns, just because I think that there is a lot of evidence that [NORP] have used handguns responsibly for sporting purposes, that they are not all used as weapons for committing crimes or killing people. I do believe, however- and let me say first-secondly, as a practical matter, I have not yet been able to get [ORG] to vote on the crime bill, including the Brady bill and the vote to ban a comprehensive list of assault weapons. I also know that I heard that Senator [PERSON] has an amendment, which I would encourage, which would make national the ban on ownership or possession of handguns by minors unless with their parents or another supervising adult in an appropriate setting, which might be the way to go on the issue that Senator [PERSON] is concerned about. Nonetheless, I hold him in the highest regard. He is , I think, an extremely responsible person, and I welcome the hearings on his legislation. But I would have a little problem with a total ban on handguns. I would have a problem with that based on what my understanding of the situation is. Again, we ought to focus on the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, and banning possession by minors right now. Since I have been working on this in [DATE], [CARDINAL] of the multitude of statistics that is made the biggest impression on me is the one that we were told [DATE], that now someone shot in a criminal encounter is [CARDINAL] times more likely to die from a gunshot wound because they are likely to have [CARDINAL] bullets in them, as opposed to [DATE]. That is a huge statistical change. And of course, as I pointed out, these wounds and the homicides put an enormous financial burden on this country, on the medical system, on the criminal justice system. But mostly, it is an incredible human problem. We have got [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people in [DATE] murdered in [GPE], most of them by gunshots. That is more in [DATE] than were ever lost in [DATE] in the war in [GPE]. I think the time has come to do something about this. And I am hopeful that both [ORG] of [ORG] will act on the crime bill and on the assault weapons bill before [DATE]. I hate to keep coming back to this, but right now I do not know that we have the votes to pass the assault weapons ban in the [ORG]. And I hope we can get the votes to do that and to pass the limitation on minors and possession or ownership of handguns. I think if we push those now in the [PERSON] bill, then the [ORG] could really make a dent on the exposure of [NORP] to lethal violence. War Powers Resolution [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], could I go back to your comments about the use of [NORP] military force and your discussions with [ORG]? Would you oppose, would you veto legislation which contained an amendment requiring you to ask and get the consent of [ORG] before you use troops in [GPE] or [GPE]? And how far do you think the congressional role in the war powers area goes? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me say, my letter says that I want to resist and that I urge the [ORG] not to vote for things which unduly infringe on the [INTERVIEWED]'s power, and certainly not things that are of questionable constitutionality. Before I express an opinion about a veto, I need to see a specific piece of legislation. And there are still discussions going on about the questions of [GPE] and [GPE]. The whole issue of the War Powers Resolution and the role of [ORG] and the role of the [INTERVIEWED] obviously has been the subject of virtually nonstop debate in [GPE] for [DATE], for all kinds of obvious reasons. Sometimes [ORG] has acted or attempted to act to restrict the [INTERVIEWED]'s authority under [INTERVIEWED]s [PERSON] and [PERSON], and sometimes they have. All I can tell you is that I think I have a big responsibility to try to appropriately consult with Members of [ORG] in both parties- whenever we are in the process of making a decision which might lead to the use of force. I believe that. But I think that, clearly, the Constitution leaves the [INTERVIEWED], for good and sufficient reasons, the ultimate decisionmaking authority. And I think to cut off that authority in advance of it being made without all the circumstances and facts there before us is an error and could really lead to weakening our relationships with a lot of our allies and encouraging the very kind of conduct we want to discourage in the world. I understand what is going on here, and it is all perfectly predictable, given any reading of [NORP] history and perfectly understandable, given the aversion that [NORP] have always had to seeing any of our young people die when the existence of our country was not immediately at stake. And the [INTERVIEWED] should be very circumspect and very careful in committing the welfare and the lives of even our [ORG]. We need to have a clear [NORP] interest there, and there needs to be clearlydefined conditions of involvement, and the burden is on the [INTERVIEWED] to provide those. But still the [INTERVIEWED] must make the ultimate decision, and I think it is a mistake to cut those decisions off in advance. Advice From Previous Administrations [INTERVIEWER]. Final question. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. In [DATE] or so, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] himself and, as we have already discussed here [DATE], some members of his foreign policy team have criticized your foreign policy team. I am curious about the promise that has been reported that [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] made to you. And it is also been reported in [CARDINAL] commentary, that there was an implied promise from your side to go easy on any revelations about the so-called Iraqgate scandal. What can you tell us about your discussions with Mr. [PERSON] on this? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, with regard to the Iraqgate issue, there was no promise expressed or implied. There was no discussion about that between me and [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I believe he said publicly that he would not have anything negative to say about the administration for [DATE] at least, that he thought we were entitled to that. And again, I just do not want to get into this. This is a free country, people have free speech, they can say whatever they want to say. I think you will agree. And maybe I have been wrong to do it, but I have been pretty careful about focusing on the problems we have in the future and not trying to spend a lot of time establishing partisan blame for the past. I said that in my State of the Union speech. I said it in the health care speech. I said it repeatedly. What is past is past. I am doing the best I can with the issues that I faced when I came here. If the time comes in the future when I have to engage in a debate with any of those folks about whodid-what-when, I will do my best to have that kind of a debate. But I just do not think-it does not get us very far. And I would hope that if they have a constructive suggestion to make about what [GPE] should do, I would be more than happy to take it. I am not ashamed to ask for advice from anybody, [NORP] or [NORP]. I have called every living former [INTERVIEWED], I have called former Secretaries of [ORG], I have called those that agreed and disagreed. As you know, Secretary [PERSON] thought that the previous administration should have done more in [GPE], thought that we should. I mean, there are people who have-Secretary [PERSON] thought just the reverse. I mean, this is a new and difficult and uncertain time. But if they have anything to say about what they think we ought to do, I will be glad to listen, and I'd just ask that it be constructive when they do it. [INTERVIEWER]. I am told by your aides that we are out of time. On behalf of the radio networks, we thank you, and we hope we can make this a regular thing. [INTERVIEWED]. I would like to do it on a regular basis. I am a big radio listener, you know. Except if we did it enough, we could even have Top 10 countdowns in the middle and stuff. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. We accept the challenge. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithradiotalkshowhosts", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much, and welcome to [FAC] and to [FAC], and thank you for coming [DATE]. Iwhat did you say, nice tie? That is a [ORG] tie. Audience member. All right! [INTERVIEWED]. I wore it for the national service signing [DATE]. It is interesting, we just had a lunch with a number of columnists Audience members. Lunch? Lunch? [INTERVIEWED]. Lunch? I am sorry. I am sorry. Would it make you feel better if I said I did not enjoy it? I mean anyway, and they knew you were all here, and we had [CARDINAL] people out on the lawn for the national service signing. And [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] of these folks that have been covering [GPE] for [DATE] said they had never seen [ORG] so busy. I did not know if they were happy or sad about it, but anyway, it is busy. I thank you for coming [DATE]. I hope this will be the first of a number of opportunities we have to provide people who have radio talk shows and who communicate with [CARDINAL] of [NORP] on an intimate basis, [DATE], to come to [ORG] to have these kinds of briefings. You have already heard all the basic approaches that the administration is going to take on health care and that will be hopefully crystallized in a compelling way in my address to the [ORG] and to the country [DATE] [TIME]. So, I thought what I would do is make a general statement about how this fits into the overall approach the administration is taking and then answer your questions. I'd rather spend time just answering your questions. But let me just make a general comment, that I think you canthat runs through the thread of debate that we had on the economic program, on the health care issue, on [ORG], on the crime bill that is coming up, on the welfare reform issue, on all the major things we are trying to come to grips with. It is now commonplace to say that we are living through a time of profound change, not only in our country but around the world. People are trying to come to grips with a rate and nature of change that comes along less frequently than once a generation. You may know that just since you have been sitting here, [PERSON] has dissolved the [NORP] Parliament and called elections for that [ORG] in [DATE], and his major opponent has apparently declared himself [INTERVIEWED]. I mean, they are going through these things, trying to come to grips with what it means to be a democracy and what it means to try to change the economy. In our country, if we are going to continue to be the leading power of the world, not just militarily but economically, socially, the shining light of the world, this has to be a good place for most [NORP] to live. Most people have to know that if they work hard and play by the rules that they can make the changes that are sweeping through this country and the world their friends and not their enemies. They have to believe that as citizens they can work together and trust the major institutions of our society to function well, to meet these changes, to respond to them. We confront this bewildering array of challenges: the size of the deficit, the fact that we have an investment deficit, too, in many critical areas, the health care crisis, at a time when most people are quite insecure in their own lives and most [NORP] have worked harder for stagnant or lower wages for [DATE], when they are paying more for the basics in life, when they have lost faith in the fundamental capacity of political institutions to represent them and to solve problems. I think you can see that in the [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] letters we got on health care. The number of people who would say, you know, What is wrong with me? I worked hard all my life, and I lost my health insurance, or My child got sick, and now I can never change my job, or My wife and I spend [TIME] a week running our business. And our health insurance was $[MONEY] a month [DATE], and it is [MONEY] a month [DATE], you know that things are out of control. I say that because I believe providing security in the health care area and in meeting the other objectives we talked about, quality and choice and cost controls and all, is a necessary precondition, not only to improve the health care of the [NORP] people but to help root the [NORP] people again in this moment, to make them freer to face the other challenges that we face. I see in this debate over NAFTA which I have wrestled with in my own mind, that is, the whole nature of our trade relations with [GPE] and other countries and where we are going for far longer than I have been [INTERVIEWED], I had to deal with it when I was a Governor. I see people, some of them looking ahead with confidence in the future that we can triumph in the world of [DATE], that we can compete and win, that we can create [DATE]'s jobs, and others so uncertain about it, just trying to hold on to [DATE] and to [DATE]'s jobs. So, what I am trying to do is to give the [NORP] people a greater sense of security over those things that are basic to their lives that they can control and at the same time challenge our people to assume responsibility for dealing with our problems and for marching confidently into the future. That is what this national service issue is all about that we celebrated [DATE] on the [FAC] lawn. And therefore, the health care issue is about more than health care. It is about restoring selfconfidence to [GPE]'s families and businesses. It is about restoring some discipline to our budget and investment decisions, not only in the Government but in the private sector. It is about giving us the sense that we actually can move forward and win in the face of all these changes. I cannot underor I guess I cannot overstate how important I think it is, not only on its own terms but also for what it might mean for [GPE] over the long run. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Does anybody really know whether this will work, from the administration? Have you parsed the numbers that fine, that you can say if this is passed in toto, it will indeed do what you say, cut costs, maintain quality of care, cover everybody? [INTERVIEWED]. We know it will do that, but that is not exactly what you asked. That is, we know that if this plan is adopted, it will provide universal coverage, that it will achieve substantial savings in many areas where there is massive waste. Dr. [PERSON], who was, you know, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]'s Surgeon General, who was with us [DATE], and the doctors that we had, said that in his judgment, there was [MONEY] of waste, unnecessary procedures, administrative waste, fraudulent churning of the system, at least, in our system. So, we know that those things will achieve those objectives? We do. Do we know that every last dollar is accurate, or that there will be no unintended consequences, or that the timetable is precisely right? No we do not know that because nobody can know that exactly. But I would like to make [CARDINAL] points. Number [CARDINAL], our administration has gone further to get good health care numbers than anyone ever has before. Until I became [INTERVIEWED] I did not know this, but the various [ORG] in [ORG] responsible for various parts of health care financing and regulation had never had their experts sit down in the same room together and agree on the same set of numbers and the same methodologies for achieving them. So that is the first thing we did. No wonder we had so much fight over what something was going to cost and the deficit was going crazy. The Government had never gotten its own act together. Then the second thing we did was to go out and solicit outside actuaries from private sector firms who made a living evaluating the cost of health care and asked them to review our numbers. Now, that is very important that you understand that, because there is going to be there should be a debate over whether the course I have recommended is the best course to achieve the goals we all want to achieve, whether there is a better course, whether we can achieve the [ORG] and [ORG] cuts that we say we can achieve without hurting the quality of care. That is fine. But I want you to understand that we really have killed ourselves at least to get the arithmetic right, to give people an honest starting point, a common ground to start from, so that we can have the arguments over policy. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel that your plan places undue hardship on business with the employer mandate versus an individual plan that has been proposed with other proposals? [INTERVIEWED]. No, and I will say why. First of all, let us just look at the employer mandate. Most employers cover their employees. I like your question in the sense that the question assumes that we should have universal coverage, and that is a good assumption. If you do not have universal coverage, you can never really slow the rate of waste in cost, because you will always have a lot of cost shifting in the system. That is, people who are not covered will still get health care, but they will get it when it is too late, too expensive, somebody else will pay the bill, and it will have real inefficiencies and distortions, as it does [DATE]. If you want to cover everybody, there are essentially [CARDINAL] ways to do it. You can do it the way [GPE] does. You can abolish all private health insurance premiums, raise taxes to replace the health insurance premiums, and have a single-payer system, just have the Government do it. That is the most administratively efficient. That is, the [NORP] system has very low administrative costs, even lower than [GPE] and [GPE]. The problem is, it is not very good for controlling costs in other ways, because the Government makes all the cost decisions. The citizens know they have already paid for this through government. So they make real demands on the system. Whereas if you have a mixed system where employers and employees are actually in there knowing what they are spending on health care and lobbying for better management and to control costs, like in [GPE], you do not have costs go up as fast. So the [NORP] system, even though it is administratively the cheapest, is the second most expensive in the world. We are spending [PERCENT] of our income; they are spending [PERCENT] of theirs. Everybody else is [DATE]. Now, the second system is the individual mandate. It is never been tried anywhere. The problem with the individual mandate is that it couldand again, I want a debate on this. I think the [NORP] are entitled to their day in court on this, and I want them to have it. Really, I do. I mean, I want an honest, open discussion on this. I am so impressed with the spirit that is pervading this health insurance we had [CARDINAL] Members of [ORG] show up for [DATE] at our health care university just trying to get everybody to have enough information to be singing out of the same hymnal when we talk to one another. The dangers of the individual mandates are that it could cause the present system we have for most [NORP], which is working well for most [NORP], to disintegrate. That is, you have to have some subsidies with an individual mandate. So will companies that now cover their employees basically start covering their upper income employees or not their lower income employees? Will they dump all their employees and make them go under the individual mandate system? How are you going to keep up with all these individuals when you realize who you have got to subsidize or not? In other words, we believe it has significantly more administrative burdens, and it has the potential to cause the present system to come undone. But they deserve their day in court on it, and we will debate it. Let me just say this. Our system for small businesses, I'd like to make the following points: We propose to keep lower the premiums of small businesses with [CARDINAL] employees, including all those that are just starting up. And they get more if their wages of their employees are low, and low-wage workers also get a subsidy to try to make sure nobody goes out of business. But the point I want to make is, most small businesses who do cover their employees, and that is the majority of them, are paying too much for their health insurance. They are being burdened by it. That is [CARDINAL] reason [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [NORP] a month permanently lose their health insurance, as well as at any given time in a year, [CARDINAL] may be without it. So what we propose to do will actually help more small businesses than it will hurt. And over the long run, they will all be better off, because if you put everybody under this system, then the rate of increase in health care costs will be much lower. And it is just not fair, at some point, for anybody who can pay something to get a free ride, because keep in mind, we all get health care in this country. But if we are not insured, we get it when it is too late, too expensive. Usually we show up at the emergency room, the most expensive of all, and then somebody else pays the bill. That is one of the things that is driving these costs out of sight. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWER]. We have heard a lot about every group [DATE], except for the doctors. And from the doctors that I am hearing from, they are saying that this is going to hit them in their pockets. In my experience before in being in operating rooms and seeing doctors after the diagnostic related groups started setting some prices of procedures back in [DATE], a lot of doctors that went into business for themselves were either multiusing single-use items or resterilizing items that were made for single-use so that they would not lose any of the money that was going to be coming to them, so they would not take a personal hit out of it. How does your plan guarantee us an uncompromised medical plan? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, for [CARDINAL] thing, the quality standards that govern medical care [DATE] will still be in effect. That is, most of them are professional standards, and they are not enforced by the Government [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. They are talking about doing more procedures to make up the money. They are saying, Well, I am going to have to see more patients and spend less time with them. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but that is what is happening [DATE]. I mean, the truth is that as we have tried to control the costs of [ORG] and [ORG], particularly [ORG], by holding down costs, you see dramatically increased numbers of procedures. What we want to do is to remove the incentive for having large numbers of procedures by having big blocks of consumers pay for their [DATE] health care needs in a block, so that you will not have so much fee-for-service. I would also point out to you that one of the big problems we have had with doctor costs going up is that doctors are having to negotiate their way through the mine field of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] separate health insurance companies writing [CARDINAL] of different policies, having to keep up with it in ways that no doctors anywhere in the world but our doctors have to deal with. We have already had [ORG] and a lot of other doctors groups have endorsed our plan. The [ORG] has been quite interestingly supportive in general terms. They say they want to see all the details. They believe there ought to be universal coverage. Dr. [PERSON] has agreed to come in and sort of moderate this discussion. But we had [CARDINAL] doctors here [DATE], most of whom were extremely supportive. And let me just give you [CARDINAL] big reason why. This is the flip side of the argument you made. In [DATE], the average doctor was taking home [PERCENT] of the money generated by a clinic. In [DATE], the average doctor was taking home [MONEY] on the dollar, [PERCENT] of the money generated by a clinic. [MONEY] on the dollar increase in the amount of money the doctor was having to spend on people, basically to do clerical work in the clinics. [ORG] at [GPE] told us [DATE] that the [CARDINAL] doctors on staff there spent enough time in non-health-care-related paperwork [DATE] because of the administrative cost of this systema dime on the dollar more than any other system in the worldto see another [CARDINAL] patients each a year, [CARDINAL] more kids a year. So, a lot of doctors are going to feel very liberated by this because they are going to be freer to practice medicine, and the incentives to churn the system just to pay for all their paperwork will be less. Yes, sir. Mr. [PERSON]. Time for [CARDINAL] more question. [INTERVIEWER]. I guess I have the opportunity, I will make it a [CARDINAL]-part question because it is a rare opportunity, and I appreciate it. First of all, if you receive everything that you want, that you are hoping for, and we hear about the [CARDINAL] uninsured and the many underinsured people, I am wondering if there is anybody that will be disappointed with the new system [INTERVIEWED]. Oh yeah. [INTERVIEWER]. if you get everything you want, and who those people might be? And secondly, I hear very little about medical fraud and medical malpractice problems, as if it is not a major problem, and we are led to believe that it is. [INTERVIEWED]. It is a big problem. Maybe I should answer that question first, because it is a quicker one. Then let me try to tell you how to sort through the winners and losers. Okay? First of all, in this system if you put consumers of health care, employers and employees, particularly the small businesses, in large buying groups where they will have more market power and more oversight authority, you will inevitablywe are going to change the economic incentives as well as the private sector oversight to reduce fraud and abusewe are definitely going to see big savings there. Secondly, what was the other thing you asked me? [INTERVIEWER]. The medical malpractice. [INTERVIEWED]. Medical malpractice. Doctors [INTERVIEWER]. Doctors spending[inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. Well, doctors [INTERVIEWER]. [Inaudible] [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] of the things that we do not know is how much extra excess procedures and tests are done as defensive medicine or to churn the system, to go back to your other question. The economic incentives to churn the system will be dramatically reduced under these kind of payment plans. It will be more like the way the [GPE], [GPE], system works, the way the [ORG] system works. More and more people will be in a system where they pay up front, and then they take what they need. And the doctors are going to get paid out of that. But the malpractice issue is a problem. We will propose some significant reforms, including limiting the percentage of income lawyers can get in contingency fees in lawsuits. But I have to tell you, what I think the most significant and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms but I think the most important one will be permitting the professional associations to draw up medical practice guidelines which, when approved, will protect the doctors to some extent, because if they follow the guidelines in any given case, it will raise a presumption that they were not negligent. And that will be a real protection against just doing an extra procedure because you are trying to hedge against a lawsuit. [GPE] pioneered this because they wanted more general practitioners in rural [GPE] to do more things for people like help deliver babies because they did not have anybody else to do it. So, the idea of giving people practice guidelines I think is very good. Now, you asked who is going to win and who is going to lose. Can we talk through that? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. I will tell you who will have to pay more. You know, there will be some people who will have to pay more. The news magazines [DATE] did a pretty good job of analyzing this. If we go to community rating, so that we can allow people, for example, who have had a sick child not to be bankrupt by their insurance costs and to move from job to job, and you put everybody in a broad community, it means young, single, super healthy people will pay more in [DATE] of this than they would have otherwise. Now, here is why I think that is a good deal for young, single, super healthy people. Number [CARDINAL], all young, single, super healthy people will get insured, and they are not now. Number [CARDINAL], they will all be middleaged someday, too, and they will win big. Number [CARDINAL], their cost will go up less [DATE]. So even though they might pay more [DATE], within [DATE], if this plan goes through, everybody will be paying less than they would have. So, they would pay more. Secondly, there are some businesses who do not insure at all. They will have to pay something. There are others who insure but only for catastrophic. They will have to pay more, but they will get much better benefits, and their rates will go up less. So, there will be some people who will pay more now than they were paying. But I believe that if we cankeep in mind, if we can stop the cost of health care from going up at [CARDINAL] times the rate of inflation, if we can get it down where the rate of increase is much lower, by [DATE] everybody will be way better off than they were. [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] do you approve [PERSON] announcement that he is going to dissolve the [ORG], and does [GPE] support him in his power struggle with his opponents? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, let me say I have had only a sketchy briefing about this, and I have not talked to [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] yet. I would like to reserve the right to issue a statement after I attempt to talk to [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. In any case, I will issue a statement before [TIME], but I think at least I should have a direct briefing. Yes sir, [CARDINAL] more. Go ahead. Health Care Reform [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], [DATE] you will be speaking before a joint session of [ORG] and there are [CARDINAL] people, individuals, in [ORG] that will have their own specific plans of what they want [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. If you could say that you could put your name on [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] specific parts of this that you want to say, This is my health care plan, that you want to see no matter what [CARDINAL] other people want to see, that you feel you want to be part of your [PERSON] health care program, what [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] items, specifically? [INTERVIEWED]. Number [CARDINAL], every [NORP] would have security in their health care system. You would be able to get health insurance, there would be adequate benefits, and you would not lose them. Number [CARDINAL], the system would impose a far higher level of responsibility for managing costs than it does now on all the players, including the consumers. Number [CARDINAL], people would keep their choice of physicians and medical providers. And [CARDINAL], we would guarantee adequate access to preventive and primary care so we could stop some of the big things that are happening to us before they get going. And [CARDINAL], we would have market incentives to bring costs down. Those are the things that I want to be the hallmark of our program. I wish I could stay [DATE]. I am sorry, but thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithraitelevisionitaly", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], it will be in [DATE] the anniversary of [DATE]. [GPE] and Europe are grateful to [GPE] for the liberation from fascism and the nazism. But [DATE], Europe and [GPE] are still divided about Ira[INTERVIEWER]. When you go in Europe, there will certainly be some demonstration against you. What is the responsibility of this situation? [INTERVIEWED] Yes, look, first of all, we share the same values we being [GPE] and Europe. And one of the values we share is the freedom for people to express themselves. So I have no problem with people saying, I disagree. Matter of fact, I think it is a healthy sign, and I think it is positive. Secondly, there are there is common agreement that [GPE] must be free and peaceful. We had disagreements about the decision to enforce the [ORG] resolution, but there is common agreement in Europe with [GPE] that it is in the world's interest that [GPE] be free and peaceful. [DATE] I just talked to the new Prime Minister and had a very good conversation with him. And he said, Thank you for giving us a chance, and thank you for standing with us. And when he said thank you, he was not talking just to me. He was talking to the [NORP] people and the [NORP] people and the [NORP] and all the people in our coalition that are now helping in Ira[INTERVIEWER]. So I am very upbeat and very as I head over to honor what happened [DATE], I think we are now seeing unity to work toward common good [DATE]. And I am looking forward to it. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, but some [NORP] blame you for having kept them out of the decision to go to the war in Ira[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think this is the real reason for present difficulties? [INTERVIEWED] Well, first of all, I do not see many difficulties. You mean in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWER]. In Ira[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] Oh, in Ira[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWER]. And at the [ORG] as well. [INTERVIEWED] Well, I think you will see [INTERVIEWER]. The ground and the [INTERVIEWED] Yes. No, I think you will see in the [ORG] there is going to be common agreement. I think we will get a new [ORG] resolution. Remember, [DATE] at [ORG], we voted unanimously to say to [PERSON], Disarm, or face serious consequences. Then it became clear he did not disarm and did not disclose, and so we had a debate about the definition of serious consequences. My attitude is, when you say something, you better do it. In other words, the world said, Serious consequences, Mr. [PERSON]. And had there not been serious consequences, I think he would have been extremely dangerous, and [ORG] would have been viewed as very weak. And so, [GPE], along with a lot of other nations, agreed that we must enforce serious consequences. But everybody had a chance to participate. Everybody had a chance, particularly on [ORG], to say yes or no. But that is now behind us, and that is what is important for the people of your great country to understand. There is [DATE] ahead. Now, in terms of [GPE], it is tough. And the reason it is tough is because there are killers in that country who want to stop the march to freedom. The worst thing they fear is free elections, but they are not going to stop us. That is what you have got to understand. We are not going to be intimidated by killers in [GPE] or anywhere else, for that matter. [INTERVIEWER]. Some have said that you never admit to any shortcomings, much less failures. Looking back at [DATE], do you have anything to reproach yourself regarding what has gone wrong? Did you make any mistakes? [INTERVIEWED] Listen, any time you go to war, circumstances change. And the fundamental question is, were we flexible enough to change with the circumstances? And we have been. Could we this is all hypothetical, when you think about it. We are changing a country from tyranny to freedom, a country where people were brutalized, tortured, raped, killed, maimed, to a country which is going to govern itself. And it has been hard work. A lot of things did not happen that we thought might happen, the oil production, for example. We thought that would be blown up, and it would cost the [NORP] citizens a lot of money. It was not . We thought that people would go hungry or there would be mass refugees, neither of which happened. What did happen is, is that we moved too quickly. Our troops stormed through to [GPE], and then it caused it enabled some of the [PERSON] loyalists, some of them, to disperse. In other words, they did not stay and fight. They ran off. They regrouped and came back to fight. And I and our troops were given the flexibility on the ground to deal with that. Now, I wish the [NORP] people had overwhelmingly said, Thank you for coming. I think they will. But some did not . Some said, Let us fight them. [INTERVIEWER]. But do not you think that now this new government could been seen as a puppet government because there are a lot of elements close to [GPE] [GPE] gives them money? [INTERVIEWED] Well, we look, you are talking about the current Prime Minister. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED] And you bet we supported a group that he headed. We did not support him. We supported his group. You know why? Because he wanted to get rid of [PERSON], and the reason why he did is not because of [GPE]. He wanted to get rid of [PERSON] because [PERSON] killed and tortured his fellow citizens. You remember what [PERSON] is like. He was a tyrant. He was brutal. He had torture rooms. There was mass graves we discovered. I had [DATE] in [FAC] [CARDINAL] men whose hands had been cut off by [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER]. We have shown this picture. [INTERVIEWED] Have you? Good. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, we have. [INTERVIEWED] A very touching moment. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you happy with this new government in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED] I am happy that Mr. [PERSON] did what he said he would do. The government was picked by [ORG]. Mr. [PERSON] went under very difficult circumstances and consulted with a lot of people and came up with what appears to be a very diverse government. Now, I have just spoken to the Prime Minister and the new [INTERVIEWED] And I told them [CARDINAL] things: [CARDINAL], thank you for taking on a very difficult assignment, thank you for leading; and [CARDINAL], [GPE] and our coalition will help you succeed, but it is up to you to succeed. You are in charge, and we will work with you to succeed. [INTERVIEWER]. How much has the abuse of prisoners at [FAC] damaged the [NORP] moral authority and credibility? [INTERVIEWED] Yes. Well, that is a very good question. Obviously, it was a shameful moment when we saw on our TV screens that soldiers took it upon themselves to humiliate [NORP] prisoners, because it does not reflect the nature of the [NORP] people or the nature of the men and women in our uniform. And what the world will see is that we will handle this matter in a very transparent way, that there will be rule of law, which is an important part of any democracy. And there will be transparency, which is a second important part of a democracy, and people who have done wrong will be held to account for the world to see. That will stand this process will stand in stark contrast to what would happen under a tyrant. You would never know about the abuses in the first place. And if you did know about the abuses, you certainly would not see any process to correct them. President's Upcoming Visit With Pope [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. You will visit the Pope as well on [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED] Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWER]. The [ORG] opposed the war and now recommends, look forward and pay more attention to the religious and moral sensitivity of the [NORP] people. What is your opinion about this recommendation? [INTERVIEWED] Well, I can understand. Look, a lot of people did not like the war. I understand that completely, and I do not like war. But I am the guy who has to decide, for our case, whether or not [PERSON] would be a threat to peace, and made a very difficult decision. After having tried all diplomacy, war was the last option. Secondly, I will tell the His Holy Father I appreciate his positions he is a great man and that I look forward to working with the [NORP] to put in place the conditions so that human rights prevail, something that did not happen under [PERSON], looking forward to the development of a society in which boys and girls can go to schools and not be filled with hateful propaganda but with knowledge. I look forward to working with the health care workers in [GPE] so that people can get decent health care. I will assure His Holy Father that we will do everything we can to elevate the human condition so that people can live in peace and freedom and remind him that a free [GPE] in the midst of the Middle East will serve as a great moment of change, will serve as an example for others to follow. You see, when the people in the Middle East see that a free society can exist in the [NORP] world, they will demand the same thing. And free societies are peaceful societies. Free societies are hopeful societies. And in the long run, the best way to defeat terror is to promote freedom, and that is what we are going to do. [INTERVIEWER]. Last question. [INTERVIEWED] Sure. [INTERVIEWER]. If you cannot succeed with [ORG], do you have a plan B as an exit strategy in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED] We will succeed we will succeed with [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER]. It is sure? [INTERVIEWED] I am confident. I am an optimist. I have talked to most of the leaders on [ORG]. I have talked to the [NORP], the [NORP], the [NORP], the [NORP], of course the [NORP], and I know there is a consensus that we must work together for the good of the [NORP] people. This is not about [GPE]. This is about [GPE] and the citizens of [GPE] who suffered under tyranny for so long. And now we have a chance to work together to promote a free society in a part of the world, by the way, that is desperate for free societies. And I know we will succeed. I have got great faith in the future. And having talked to the new leadership some of the new leadership in [GPE] I can tell you they share that same sense of destiny, the same great hope for their people. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED] Good to see you, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithraultolaamericatv", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to Peru/APEC Summit [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. [INTERVIEWED], a pleasure to be with you. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, sir. [INTERVIEWER]. You are about to travel to [GPE], [GPE], again. You are going to the [ORG]. And this is your last trip as [INTERVIEWED] [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER].How would you like to remember both trip and [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. I will first of all, I remember [GPE] fondly from my last visit in [DATE], and I am looking forward to going back. I think it will be said, when people analyze the relationship between [GPE] and [GPE], that during my time in office and the time of [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and [PERSON], we worked hard to put a good relationship in place. And so, on the [CARDINAL] hand, I will be able to go and confirm the importance of the bilateral relationship, and then I will go to a very important meeting. And [ORG] is an important meeting this time, particularly given the financial situation in the world. [ORG] comes right after the economic summit we had here in [GPE]. So it means that it has the chance to embrace the principles, but it also has a chance for countries that did not participate in the summit here in [GPE] to express their views. So I am looking forward to it. It is a very important meeting. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you built a relationship with [GPE] because you have a close friendship with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] [INTERVIEWED]. Si. [INTERVIEWER]. with former [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], which held the negotiations in favor of FTA [INTERVIEWED]. Si. [INTERVIEWER]. which was finally approved. Now we have [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] in [GPE], and elected [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] in your country. Do you think this new situation is going to change the relationships between the [CARDINAL] countries? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I do not think so. I really do not . First of all, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] is muy amable. And [INTERVIEWED]-elect [PERSON] will find him to be a straightforward man. Secondly, the foundation is very strong. And so I anticipate and believe that bilateral relations with [GPE] and [GPE] will continue to be vibrant and strong and respectful. It is important for the [NORP] [INTERVIEWED] and I know [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] will be this way is to respect the leaders, the culture, and the people of the different countries. [INTERVIEWER]. Let us talk about Latin America, [INTERVIEWED]. Sometimes it is said that at the beginning of your administration you were very interested in building up a strong relationship with Latin America, but 9/11 changed the priorities for the United States. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Is it true? [INTERVIEWED]. No, it really is not . I understand that. I mean, a lot of my well, you know, when I was on TV, for example, after 9/11, I was talking about securing [GPE] and the war on terror. And so I am certain a lot of people in the neighborhood, Central and South America, said, Well, he is only focused on the Middle East; he does not really seem to care about us. But I have traveled. And in order to defeat that attitude, I came to Central and South America a lot as [INTERVIEWED]. I have been to your country twice. And secondly, more important than trips, though, is policy. Free trade agreements with nations in the region are important for development. Social justice programs focusing on health and education for citizens in the region are indicate our desire to help improve the human condition; the Millennium Challenge Account for countries in the region. So in other words, the record speaks about our deep desire to be good neighbors and to have friends. [INTERVIEWER]. But some pundits said that the lack of policies in foreign affairs gears through Latin America empowered some political tyrants, like [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. No, I strongly disagree with that. I can understand pundits. There is a lot of pundits everywhere, but I believe that our policies have obviously set a different example of what is available for people. I mean, ours is a country that believes strongly in social justice. We believe good societies must have educated people. It is hard to be hopeful if there is not good health. And finally, ours is a country that promoted free and fair trade, which is the best way to help nations develop their economies. I mean, in other words, you are a [NORP] farmer, you'd like to be selling into [GPE] markets, and because it is a big market. Nothing wrong with selling in the [NORP] market or in countries bor dering [GPE] or throughout South America. But also, it gives you an option to sell into [GPE] markets. And that is the best way to help people make a living. And we have obviously, there is a philosophical difference of opinion. And the only thing [GPE] tries to do is to show the human side of the philosophy that most leaders embrace, which is freedom, free markets, free trade, and social justice. [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], elected [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] said that at [DATE] of his administration, he will withdraw troops from [GPE] in a period of [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. It also is obvious that we are all in a middle of a huge global financial crisis. Do you think that this marks the end of an era which started with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] and highlighted the [GPE] hegemony with both military and economically? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I do not think so. I think [GPE] is still going to be a leader. It is going to be important for whoever the [INTERVIEWED] is, whether it be obviously, [INTERVIEWED]-elect [PERSON], but [INTERVIEWED]s following that [GPE] builds close alliances and friendships. That is exactly what this administration does. I mean, the classic case is with [GPE]. We have worked hard to have a good, strong, bilateral relations. And the [INTERVIEWED]-elect is going to be facing difficult decisions. My job, as the sitting [INTERVIEWED], is to help him as he transitions into the job. I want him to succeed. And I want him to be able to have a economic platform that is good for the country. Now, obviously, we are in difficult times economically. We have taken some very strong measures here during my Presidency. And I am very hopeful that these measures will make it easier for [INTERVIEWED]-elect [PERSON], not harder. I have worked hard on a lot of fronts. I think [GPE] is more secure now than it was. Democracy is more vibrant in parts of the world that did not see democracy. Trade is agreements are more abundant now. I have given it my all. And now I am very hopeful that the man who succeeds me as [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] succeeds in his job. [INTERVIEWED]ial Transition [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] last question, [INTERVIEWED] [INTERVIEWED]. Elected [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] said in his slogan, his campaign slogan, that change is the main thing for [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON], yes. [INTERVIEWED]. You know, when I campaigned for office, I said I was for change. Everybody who campaigns is for change. And that is a very effective slogan, and he ran a very effective campaign. And the [NORP] people spoke loud and clear. And now it is it will be his turn in [DATE] to assume the great honor of being [INTERVIEWED]. And I want to help him and help his team transition into office. And I really do wish him all the best. It is going to be very important that he be given a good start. And that is what we are going to do. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Si. [PERSON].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrebeccarankinvh1newyorkcity", "text": "[INTERVIEWER]. [ORG] Save The Music, you have been involved for a while. When did you first hear about the program, and why did it draw you? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am trying to remember whether I first heard about it from my wife or whether I read something about it. But I actually wrote a letter to [PERSON] because I was so excited about what they were doing. I had been in school music when I was a young person, starting at [DATE]. And I had been really, really upset about all these schools dropping their music programs when I was Governor. And [PERSON] and I redid the school standards in [GPE]. We tried very hard to protect the music programs and the arts programs and the physical education programs for the people who were not in team sports. And so I realized that all over the country these schools were under more and more financial pressure, and they thought that maybe the path of least resistance was just to get rid of the music programs. And so here was someone trying to do something about it. I was just thrilled, and I wanted to help. Music in the [INTERVIEWED]'s Life [INTERVIEWER]. Very cool. Growing up I know, I have watched a lot of tapes on you. We did Rock and Roll [INTERVIEWED] a while back with you. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, in [DATE]. I loved it. [INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. They gave me a copy of that. Music education was really important to you, obviously, growing up [INTERVIEWED]. Really important. [INTERVIEWER]. and music was really important. Looking at where you are now, arguably [CARDINAL] of the most important people on the planet, what did music education do for you, and how has it come to play in your life now? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, it gave me an outlet for all this energy I had. It gave me a constructive way to be creative. It also taught me discipline, and it taught me that to create something beautiful required hard work and discipline. It taught me how to be to create alone and also how to work with a group, in a band, a jazz band or a combo. And it made me happy. I mean, it just made me happy. It is such a wonderful when I was a kid and I'd have a tough time, as long as I could play, I could always be okay. I could just be in a private place. And it fueled my imagination. And it gave me an appreciation of things in life that has stayed with me to the present day. I can still go in my music room that [PERSON] built me upstairs in [FAC] and play for [TIME], and all the cares of the world go away. Congressional Resolution on Music Education [INTERVIEWER]. Very nice. So you guys have got to remember that when you are playing. Mr. [PERSON] said it. Let us talk about, there was a resolution passed in [ORG] [DATE], unanimous resolution, saying that music education was extremely important. Why is it so important that this was passed, and what is it going to do in the future? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it was important that it was passed because it shows that the Representatives of the people of both parties have now are acknowledging that it is important and it is a problem because there are so many schools that do not offer it anymore. And I think it will tend to increase public awareness of this, public support for maintaining the music programs. [ORG] [ORG] did a study [DATE], and [PERSON] was the honorary chair of the committee. They found that local pressure, parental involvement, community involvement was the single most important factor in either keeping or restoring music programs to the schools. And so I think that is why it matters. I think also, though, the [ORG] and the [INTERVIEWED] have a responsibility to keep putting as much money out there to the schools to pay for their other expenses as possible the buildings, the teachers, to have smaller classes so the schools will have the money they need for the music programs. But you know, there is lots and lots of research on this now which shows that if a good school music program increases academic performance, that a lot of young people learn in different ways and are dramatically stimulated by music. So that is another reason we ought to be for this. It actually will help the overall learning enterprise. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. That is an important point because I think everybody thinks of it as just an art, and it stops there [INTERVIEWED]. Not true. [INTERVIEWER]. and it is culture, and it carries through. We have had a lot of artists helping us [DATE] with [ORG] week and the Today Show. [PERSON] was out [DATE]; [PERSON] from [ORG]; [ORG]. [DATE] we have [PERSON] playing at the Today Show in [FAC]. Are you a [PERSON] fan? [INTERVIEWED]. He is great. I love [PERSON]. I really I think he is great. I am a music fan of his. I like his acting. He is doing very well in the movies now. And he is a marvelous young man. He is been to [FAC] to visit [PERSON] and me on several occasions. He is really he is a very nice man. And I am pleased for his success, and I am grateful that he is helping [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. What does it say to the public to have such important sort of star power behind a program like [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I hope that it increases the public's awareness. I hope it says, hey, this is really important. I mean, these people could all be doing something else. And I hope it says to them, if all these people who do music for a living think it is important for all our kids to have access to music, maybe it is. [INTERVIEWER]. All right. These guys do you go to this school, P.S. [CARDINAL]? Audience members. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. All right, so the program and what is happening with the [GPE] school boards and public education and music and what is going on here [DATE] can you talk a little bit about what is being presented [DATE] and what is going to [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. If you look at these students here, [ORG] has given them these instruments, so they are going to start a music program. Now, [DATE], this school had one of the worst performances in [GPE]. And they have gone from having [PERCENT] of their kids not read at grade level to having [CARDINAL] of their kids read at or above grade level in [DATE]. So they want this school to be one of the best schools in [GPE]. They have a school uniform policy, as you see, which is a very positive thing, I think. And now they want a music program. And what they know is not only will these children learn music and they will enjoy it; it will further increase the academic performance of this school. So I think they are all excited about it, and they are all proud of their school. Are not you? Audience members. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. It is just kind of exciting to have [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] here, too, right? Audience members. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, yes, just a little. Audience member. An honor. Music in the [INTERVIEWED]'s Life [INTERVIEWER]. An honor. A big honor. [CARDINAL] last thing. TV moments, music moments on television what stands out in your mind as a huge one growing up, [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. When the [PERSON] were on [PERSON]. When [PERSON] was on [PERSON]. I think those [CARDINAL] things, when I was very young, made a big impression on me. [INTERVIEWER]. Cool. All right. Thank you very much. I think you have to go back downstairs, so [laughter]. These are things I cannot see what is going on, but I think [TIME] are up. Thank you so much. It was such an honor. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithregionalreporters", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. So I usually do not start these off with a long statement. Obviously, our overarching focus right now is the economy. I am very mindful of the hardships that are taking place all throughout the country: families who are losing their homes, losing their jobs, losing their health care. I get a sampling of the letters that are sent to me [DATE], and some of the stories are just heartbreaking. And everything that we are doing is focused on not only pulling this economy out of what is the worst recession since the Great Depression, but also looking at ways that we can set a foundation for long-term economic growth. You know, [DATE] of growing the economy through an overheated housing market or through people running up exorbitant credit card bills is over. We have got to put our growth model on a different footing, and that means that we have got to deal with our health care system and reduce costs for families, businesses, and governments. It means that we have to think through our energy policy so that we are not so badly dependent on foreign oil. It means we have got to improve our education system so that our young people are equipped with the skills and knowledge that they are going to need to get jobs in the future. And so the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed reflected those priorities. You know, we had tax cuts to the middle class, but also investments on health information technologies and doubling renewable energy, a enormous effort to jump-start school reform at the same time as we are providing some much needed relief to [GPE], so that they would not be laying off teachers and firefighters and cops, and that we could rebuild our infrastructure. The budget that I have now prepared and will be going before [ORG] and debated over [DATE] reflects many of those common priorities, and we are going to be building off of the progress that we made in [DATE]. Now is the time, I think, for us to deal with health care in a serious way and start reducing costs as well as expand coverage. We are going to have to keep pushing on the energy front not just with things like the smart grid, but also figuring out how do we move to more renewable energies. And on education, how do we build on the reforms that we talked about during the campaign and that are funded, at least temporarily, through the stimulus package. And I gave a major speech on education priorities [DATE]. I think that there is going to be some battles surrounding this budget, there always are. Obviously, at the same time, as we are moving this budget forward, I am spending probably the majority of my time stabilizing the financial system. There are some who've argued that we cannot do all of these things at once and that we should instead just focus on Wall Street and banking and not deal with the enormous pressures that families are feeling on a day-to-[DATE] basis. I think that would be a mistake. I think that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. And so even as we are working on financial stabilization, reregulating Wall Street, we are going to keep on pressing to get the investments that will ultimately lead to long-term economic growth. So I also have [GPE] and [GPE] to deal with but I figured that would at least get us started. So why do not we just go around the room. I will try to make sure that everybody gets a question. Since we have got somewhat limited time, I will try to keep my answers short, if you guys can keep your questions short. All right. [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], for having us [DATE]. Since we are only going to get maybe [CARDINAL] shot, I want to ask you a question that is of great concern to the people of my [GPE] of [GPE]. And as you are fully aware, [GPE] is besieged by drug-related violence. In my State there is a very real concern that this violence will spill over to the border; in a few cases, it already has. What specifically does the administration plan to do to help contain this violence? And on a related note, if there is anything you could say about immigration reform and when we might see some sort of action on that front? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as you know, the first meeting with a foreign leader that I had after my election was with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] in [GPE], who I believe is really working hard and taking some extraordinary risks under extraordinary pressure to deal with the drug cartels and the corresponding violence that is erupted along the borders. So [DATE] Admiral [PERSON], Chairman of [ORG], visited with his counterparts in [GPE]. [PERSON], our director of [ORG], a border State Governor, has been convening meetings with all the relevant agencies and consulted with the Governors down there. We expect to have a full a fully or a comprehensive approach to dealing with these issues of border security that will involve supporting [PERSON] and his efforts in a partnership, also making sure that we are dealing with the flow of drug money and the guns south, because it is really a [CARDINAL]-way situation there. The drugs are coming north, we are sending funds and guns south, and as a consequence, these cartels have gained extraordinary power. And so, our expectation is to have a comprehensive policy in place in [DATE]. With respect to immigration reform, to some degree the collapse of housing construction in the country has slowed the flow of illegal immigrants coming into the country, but it remains a serious concern. And our approach is to do some things administratively to strengthen border security, to fix the legal immigration system, because a lot of the pressure or a lot of the impetus towards illegal immigration involves a broken legal system. People want to reunify families, and they do not want to wait [DATE]. I think we can make some progress on that front, and we have started to talk to all the parties involved and both parties here in [GPE] about the prospects of taking legislative steps. But, obviously, we have got a lot on our plate right now. And so what we can do administratively, that is where we are going to start. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], the numbers that came out [DATE] show that [GPE] lost [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs [DATE]. You have been in [GPE]; you have seen the ravage there. Aside from a bailout to the auto industry and the RV industry, are there policies that [GPE] ought to be embracing to strengthen its economy, or is the manufacturing sector in [GPE] and elsewhere doomed? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, obviously, I come from a neighboring [GPE], and if you think about northwest [GPE], it is as much a part of the [GPE] regional economy as [GPE]'s. And so I am very mindful of what is been happening. But I think that also points to where the opportunities are. Both [GPE] and [GPE] have done relatively well, those regions, because of a diversified economy. So what started off as hardcore traditional manufacturing towns made the transition to other areas: building on the universities, setting up research parks, thinking about innovative sectors in bio-medicine or in energy technologies. And so part of what I think every State should be doing right now is figuring out, A, how do we invest in our people so that we are attracting world-class businesses who are looking for world-class employees? I think getting K-12 education right, not short-changing higher education, I think those things are absolutely critical; thinking about where can where do strategic infrastructure investments make sense. You know, if you think about the Midwest, one of the problems is, is that this is my stenographer. She just wants to make sure that I am not tripping over myself. [CARDINAL] of the exciting things that we put in our stimulus package, for example, was high-speed rail, and is there an opportunity to connect [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], so that we are linking up some of these major metropolitan hubs in ways that provide us a competitive advantage in the world economy. I think making sure that we are setting up research facilities or encouraging and attracting researchers, venture capital that spins off new technologies into commercial applications, some [NORP] do that better than others. Obviously, Silicon Valley is the best example of it, but [GPE], along [FAC], did it very well. There is no reason why working with some of the world-class universities that exist in the heartland in the Midwest that we do not adopt some of those same practices. So we are going to do everything we can to preserve our manufacturing base. We have to recognize that some of those workers who used to manufacture steel now are going to be manufacturing solar panels. And we have got to make sure that they are equipped to do that. Okay? [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWER]. You named a special envoy [DATE] to oversee the closure of [FAC]. I'd like to ask you about that. Among the places being possibly being considered as an alternative to those prisons is [GPE], [GPE]. There is a wall of opposition [INTERVIEWED]. Where my mother was born, by the way. [INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. There is a wall of opposition to that: local officials, people in the area, and plus from the congressional delegations of those [GPE]. How would you explain the rationale between the possibility if a place like [GPE] would be chosen, the rationale behind that, and reassuring people of their safety and security? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, keep in mind, we have not made any decisions on this. But also recognize that these individuals who have been imprisoned, many of whom are very violent or who have been detained, many of whom are violent and are pledging violence against [GPE], once captured are similar to criminals who have engaged in violence of other types. They are a serious risk, but so are many of the people who are currently in prison. And we would not we would never put people into a situation that elevated the risks for surrounding communities. And that will, obviously, be something that we take very seriously as we are making these decisions moving forward. But we already have experience with terrorists who are in [ORG] prisons. And there is been no indication that the safety and security of prison guards or the surrounding communities have been compromised as a consequence. That does not mean that it is not a serious issue. I recognize why people are concerned. We have not made any firm decisions on this yet. But I have every confidence that we can determine the ultimate fates of those in [FAC] in a way that is consistent with our values, consistent with our ideals, and that keeps us safe and secure. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], [DATE] you called for eliminating restrictions on the number of charter schools, while enforcing some vigorous standards. In [GPE], the Governor has called charter schools a destructive influence on public education, [DATE] tried to have a moratorium on new charters, now wants to cut [ORG] spending by [PERCENT] for charter schools and restrict some other funding. I am wondering whether you have ever talked with him about this, and is this just a fundamental disagreement between the [CARDINAL] of you? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, I have not had a conversation with Governor [PERSON]. I know that part of his concern was prompted by some bad experiences with charters in [GPE] that were not up to snuff. And if you looked at my statement [DATE], what I said was, not only should we lift the cap on charters, we should also shut down charters that are not meeting standards. I do not think that is inconsistent with Governor [PERSON]'s position. My goal here is to create laboratories of innovation so that in the public school system, we are on a race to the top as opposed to stuck in the old ways of doing things. And we have got to; we have got to do that. In your home town of [GPE], I do not know off the top of my head what the dropout rate is, but I have got to assume that it is hovering around [PERCENT]. If you look at the number of children going through the [GPE] public schools who are actually prepared to go to college, it is probably [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. And that is just not acceptable. It is not acceptable for them; it is not acceptable in terms of [GPE]'s economic future. And so we have got to experiment with ways to provide a better educational experience for our kids, and some charters are doing outstanding jobs. So the bottom line is to try to create innovation within the public school system that can potentially be scaled up, but also to make sure that we are maintaining very high standards for any charter school that is created. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, I have to ask you an ethanol question. [INTERVIEWED]. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWER]. The biofuels as you probably know, your [ORG] Secretary is joining the ethanol industry and calling on the [ORG] to do an immediate increase in the ethanol limit to [PERCENT] [PERCENT], in advance of doing a higher [PERCENT]. Engine manufacturers, the automakers have been opposed to this. What is your position? Are you going to get involved in this decision by [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. At some point I usually get involved. If it somebody explained to me that nothing comes to my desk if it is easy. It means that somebody else has solved it. And I suspect that this one will be reconciling a lot of different issues. As you know, I have been a supporter of biofuels. I think it is an important ingredient in our overall energy independence. I have also said and I said during the campaign trail in [GPE], in front of farmers, that it was important for us to transition to the next generation of biofuels, that we have got to do a much better job of developing cellulosic ethanol, that corn-based ethanol, over time, is not going to provide us with the energy efficient solutions that are needed. And I want to make sure, though, as somebody who comes from a corn-growing [GPE], that the progress that we have made in building up a biofuels infrastructure and the important income generation that has come from ethanol plants, that that is sustained, that that is maintained. So our challenge, I think, is to see our current ethanol technology as a bridge to the biofuels technologies of the future. And that is what we want to invest in, and that is what I will be directing my [ORG] to focus on. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], you already mentioned the budget fight. I'd like to talk to you a little bit more about that, the one that is coming up. The budget outline is an extraordinary document in many ways and encapsulates a large part of the governing agenda that your administration has laid out. It is no surprise the [NORP] do not really like it. But the interesting thing is, it may be the centrist [NORP] who are the this evolving coalition of centrist [NORP] and [NORP] in the [ORG] and, to some degree, the Blue Dogs in the [ORG], that are the real problem as they begin to look at the budget and find objections. Could you talk a little bit about that, the coming budget fight, but specifically what you can do to make sure that the vision in that document simply is not dismantled as it goes through the messy budget process? [INTERVIEWED]. Let me sort of provide you an overarching frame, because I think that, you know, there is the way that it has been discussed, I think, in some cases overstates the degree to which there is some massive transformational shift. On the other hand, in some ways it understates, I think, the significant reforms that are embedded in the budget. So point [CARDINAL], this is a pretty honest budget. You have got [MONEY] that we have put into the budget that for [DATE] at least have never been acknowledged as costs. Fixing AMT, which is [MONEY] a year, that was just off the books; the war in [GPE], off the books. The way budgeting was done, it presumed that there was never, ever a national emergency arising out of a hurricane, a flood, or tornado; that none of them existed. Now, if we had continued on had we applied the same gimmicks and tricks to our budget as folks have been putting up with for [DATE], including Members of [ORG], we could make our numbers look really pretty. We thought that that was the wrong approach. So number [CARDINAL], we have provided, I think, a honest document of what the costs of Government are right now. Second point is that on the revenue side, I campaigned during the election, and was not shy about it, that we needed to restore some balance to our Tax Code; that over [DATE], the average worker has seen no increase in their wages or incomes when you factor in inflation, just been flat, whereas the top 5 percent, but more particularly [PERCENT], and even more particularly the top [PERCENT], had seen extraordinary gains in their incomes. And what I said was, is that we needed to return to the tax structure that existed during [DATE] under [PERSON] and let the [PERSON] tax cuts lapse. That is what this budget does. Now, if you think about it, just to go back to the budget gimmick issue before, since [DATE], part of the trick that had been perpetrated on the [NORP] people was to say that the [PERSON] tax cuts would lapse in [DATE], and that is why this was not a huge budget buster. So in effect, all we are doing is actually moving forward with the premise of the budget that the [NORP] presented [DATE], which was that this was supposed to lapse in [DATE]. For them to suggest now that this is some radical assault on the rich, I think, just makes no sense whatsoever. Here is what we do, though, we say that on health care, energy, and education, it is time for us to make investments that had been put off for [DATE] and had made us less competitive. And every dime of increased spending that we include in those areas we offset either with additional revenues or with cuts, and we cut a lot of stuff. I mean, we are looking at [MONEY] of cuts out of [ORG]'s Advantage program, where we are subsidizing insurers but not making seniors any healthier. We are making significant cuts in procurement, [MONEY] that we have identified by making sure that we are not engaging in the same no-bid contracting that has been such a problem. In fact, if you look at the trajectory of our nondefense discretionary spending, which is what usually people think about when they think about whether a budget is loaded up with a bunch of nonessential spending, following our budget, we would drive nondefense discretionary spending down to the lowest levels since they started keeping records back in [DATE], much lower as a percentage of GDP than it was under [PERSON] or under [PERSON]. So really what the big arguments are going to be about are, number [CARDINAL], do you believe that now is the time for us to deal with health care in a serious way? And if you are serious about long-term fiscal responsibility and dealing with [ORG] and [ORG], then you cannot say we are not going to deal with health care now. That is our biggest problem. If health care continues to go up at [PERCENT] a year, then we cannot solve our budget deficits, and we cannot solve our national debt. So I am happy to have that argument with anybody. I also think that on the energy front, if we are not willing to start putting a price on carbons that are contributing to climate change but also encourage us to use fossil fuels that we end up importing from other countries, then we can talk all we want about energy independence; we are not going to get there. And on education, if we are pricing people out of the college market, if nobody wants to teach because teachers do not get paid much, if we are not investing in early childhood education, if we are not investing in science and technology, then we are going to fall behind. So whether we are talking about [NORP] or my fellow [NORP], my argument is going to be that these are the right priorities for [GPE], these are the right priorities for long-term economic growth. Yes, they require some uncomfortable votes. If it was easy, I am assuming it would have been done [DATE] or [DATE]. It is not easy, but it is the right thing to do. The [INTERVIEWED]'s Staff/Food Safety [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I wanted to ask you about your [ORG] and your senior staff. By my count, you have [CARDINAL] folks from the Midwest, [CARDINAL] from the West, a crowd from the Northeast, and with maybe the exception of your able-bodied Press Secretary [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON]? [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. He is the only [NORP]? [INTERVIEWER]. I think so. [INTERVIEWED]. You guys are feeling neglected? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. So I am wondering why is that, and what you do not like about the South? [INTERVIEWED]. I love the South. [INTERVIEWER]. And I'd also ask like to ask you about I think this is an unrelated question the Salmonella outbreak and food safety originated in [GPE], and what you think needs to be done about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, the I love the South. I have got to admit that we have thought a lot about finding the very best people for the jobs and have not been thinking with great intensity about regionalism, because partly, except for food and sports teams and weather, I mean, we are one country. And I think that people are so mobile [DATE] that I tend to think of ourselves as all just [NORP]. But if you have got some great [NORP] who want to work for us, please let me know, because we are always open. I love the South. Food safety is a serious concern, and I have directed both [ORG] I have directed both [ORG] and [ORG] to work to come up with a plan so that a lot of these different agencies that have some jurisdiction over food safety are integrated in a much more effective way and things are not falling through the cracks. There is a lot of work that needs to be done in working on the front-end with food producers so that there are better warning signals of potential problems than we have right now. And we also need to be able to trace sources of food contamination much more quickly than we are doing right now. And technology can be helpful, but the key is actually reorganizing the agencies that are responsible so that they are working more in concert than they are right now. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, and thanks for doing these. I actually have a follow up on [ORG], and that is, do you still support that agency regulating tobacco, and if so [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. what is the timeline you'd like to see [ORG] working on that? And is the agency up to the task if we are still having just like we saw [DATE] with the peanut butter food problems? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, we are probably going to have an announcement on this fairly soon, so I do not want to step on my own story, but I do think that the [ORG] has an important role to play on an issue that, obviously, has enormous impact on the health of the [NORP] people. That is all you are going to get out me there. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWER]. I have a question sort of similar to the [GPE] question. The Voting Rights Act, as you know, does not Birmingham [INTERVIEWED]. I was just about to say, the do not I have some [GPE] people in my [ORG]? [INTERVIEWER]. Well, [PERSON] is from [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. There you go, it is close. [INTERVIEWER]. The Voting Rights Act, as you know, does not apply especially section 5 does not apply to the entire country. The South is still required to get preclearance for election-related changes. There is an argument in [GPE], and I think some other [NORP] States, that they have sort of outgrown that; they no longer need that close scrutiny from [ORG] to make those kinds of sometimes very simply changes. I know in [DATE] you supported reauthorization, but do you still think the South needs this close supervision of [ORG] on under section 5? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I got to be careful here because I am a law professor, so I may get too deep on the weeds on this stuff, get [INTERVIEWER]. No, try it. Go for it. [INTERVIEWED]. But the idea behind section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is that if there are discriminatory barriers to voting, that [ORG] has some mechanism to actually deal with it; that you do not just leave it up to the [GPE] to self-correct, but that you have got some basis for intervention. The most obvious kinds of violations do not happen very often [DATE], the classic being sort of the poll tax or the county clerk who just turns away [NORP] voters. That is not really the key issue in the Voting Rights Act [DATE]. Typically, the issues that come up now have to do with whether there is a meaningful opportunity to select a candidate of your choice. If you have got a situation in which there is very racially polarized voting, and you have got, you know, [PERCENT] of the population is [NORP] or [NORP] and the rest is majority white and it is a polarized part of the country and you have got at-large voting systems, well, it is conceivable that on a city council or a county board, you'd never have [NORP] or [NORP] on that board. So that is what section 5 of the Voting Rights Act does, is to try to preclear, see if there are any changes in the voting systems that would prevent people from exercising a meaningful vote. The key concept, I think, in judging whether or not a jurisdiction still should be jumping through that hoop is probably the degree to which there are still highly racially polarized voting, under the parlance, racial black vote. And, you know, there are probably some parts of the South that were under section 5 that if you looked at the data are no longer that polarized. There are other parts that are probably still very polarized. So I think it is the task of the courts to look and [ORG], in future reauthorizations to look at the evidence and to see is that kind of polarization still taking place. And is that you know, it is not enough just to look and see is that [CARDINAL] factor out of [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] factors, is it such a significant factor that, in fact, it is really preventing certain groups from having any representation whatsoever. So I guess that is all a long way of saying that you really have to look at the data and examine whether or not it still has some applicability. The only other thing I'd the only other point I'd make about this is keep in mind that the preclearance is just that, it requires before you make a change to go before [ORG] or the Federal courts and just show that these changes are not a problem. That is not such a huge hurdle to jump through. So I think it is legitimate to err on the side of caution before you started eliminating that requirement. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I wanted to follow up on the border question and the violence in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] recently decided to send [CARDINAL] of his troops to the border. The [GPE] Governor has asked for [CARDINAL] [GPE] troops or Border agents to reinforce the border on our side. What is the tipping point, in your mind, where the violence gets so bad that you need to act? And related to that, you named a new drug czar [DATE]. You have taken that position out of the [ORG]. You, in the past, have talked about decriminalization of marijuana. Are we still engaged in a war on drugs? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me first start on the troop issue. We have got a very big border with [GPE]. And so I am not interested in militarizing the border. I am interested in providing the kind of in creating the kind of partnership with [ORG] that ensures the safety of [GPE] citizens, the safety of [NORP] citizens, and allows for the continued cross-border trade that is so important to the region. If we are going to examine whether and if [ORG] deployments would make sense and in what circumstances they would make sense as part of this overall review of our border situation, I have not drawn any conclusions yet. I do not have a particular tipping point in mind. I think it is unacceptable if you have got drug gangs crossing our borders and killing [GPE] citizens. I think if [CARDINAL] [GPE] citizen is killed because of foreign nationals who are engaging in violent crime, that is enough of a concern to do something about it. With respect to what was the second question? [INTERVIEWER]. If decriminalization of the marijuana laws [INTERVIEWED]. I think what gave me pause on that question was I think you I am not sure it is accurate to say that I well, the implication was somehow that I think we should weaken our drug laws. That is never been my position. I think that what we do have to I think the approach that we do need to take is to make sure that we have a both/and approach as opposed to an either/or approach. I think traditionally the debate is either interdiction, criminalization, longer drugs longer prison sentences for not only dealers, but users; that is one approach. And then the other approach would be sort of a public health, decriminalization approach. My attitude is we do have to treat this as a public health problem, and we have to have significant law enforcement. And, you know, if we can reduce demand, obviously, that allows us to focus more effectively where interdiction is needed, where we have got to go after serious drug dealers and narcotrafficking. Right now I think that we are fighting with [CARDINAL] hand tied behind our back because our effort to lower demand is grossly underfunded, not as effective as it needs to be. The average person who is seeking serious substance abuse treatment in a big city like [GPE] or [GPE] typically has a 3-, 4-, [DATE] waiting list to get enrolled in a program. I think that is a problem, and most law enforcement officials, I think, would agree that it is a problem. Communication of Economic Stabilization Policy [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I have a general question about your overall communication strategy as [INTERVIEWED]. I mean, here we are on [DATE], I think this is and I appreciate you talking to us regional reporters. You have done outreach with bloggers; I think you have done outreach to columnists across the political spectrum. There is still a lot of fear out there about the economy, the stock market. People are not buying cars; they are not buying homes. Do you feel that you have done a good enough job so far in really laying out what the game plan is for your administration in tackling this financial mess that is pulled the rug out from under the economy? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, I think that we can always do a better job. Keep in mind, it is only been [DATE] since I gave a joint session speech to [ORG], [DATE] after which everybody said, Boy, that was really clear, and, We have a clear sense of what is going on. You know, the reviews were pretty good. I recognize, I think, the degree of concern that people have. We have been in office [DATE] so far. This is a crisis that was [DATE] in the making, maybe longer in some, you know, certain aspects of it. The buck stops with me, and we are responsible, but it is going to take some time. And the truth of the matter is that the [NORP] people, I think, understand that it is going to take some time. If you look at the public polling, they recognize it is going to take a while to dig ourselves out of the hole. We passed the stimulus package, and I have been talking [DATE] about elements of the stimulus package, the recovery package that are going to be having an immediate impact in the various hometowns that you represent. I think Mayor [PERSON], [DATE] we signed it, talked about the [CARDINAL] police officers that would not be laid off as a consequence of the stimulus. So I think people are getting the message that slowly, surely we are making progress on these fronts. We released a housing plan that is providing significant relief, and you are already starting to see an uptick in refinancings that are providing families with relief. And in certain pockets of the country you are starting to see housing prices stabilize after a long drop. You know, I think the [CARDINAL] area where there is still significant uncertainty has to do with the bank issue. And that is obviously a particular concern to Wall Street. The challenge for us there is that we are in the process of undergoing or conducting these stress tests of the banks to get a better sense of what their capital positions are and how strong they are. And what we do not want to do is to prejudge those tests or make a lot of statements that cause a lot of nervousness around banks that are already having difficulty right now. So on that particular issue, you know, we have got to, I think, explain to the [NORP] people and as I said, we can always to do better why it is so important to get lending going again, get credit flowing to businesses and consumers. I will be making statements about this [DATE], [DATE], in my radio addresses, [DATE]. And the main message that I am going to be delivering is that it is going to take some time to get out of this deep hole we are in, but we are going to get out of it. The other message, though, is that there are no shortcuts to long-term economic growth, and we cannot just keep on doing the same things that we were doing before and somehow expect that all our problems are going to be solved. We have got to tackle some of these things like health care, energy, and education that have been put off for too long. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I have a question about [ORG], in honor of the Discovery launch [TIME]. Right now, the retirement of the space shuttle in [DATE] is going to devastate the space coast economy down in [GPE]. You are looking at [CARDINAL] 500 job losses, at the least, at the center, which will multiply to [CARDINAL] 000 jobs throughout that entire area. Right now, you reaffirmed [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]'s decision to retire the shuttle in [DATE]. I guess what I want to know is why you decided to keep that [DATE] retirement date for the shuttle and what type of plans you may have to try to save the space coast from an economic crater? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, we have authorized, and we are budgeted for, additional shuttle launches that had not been scheduled. And so we are extending the life of the shuttle, because, A, I think it is doing some important work, and B, we are very mindful of the economic impact of the space program in the region. I will soon be appointing a new [ORG] director. I think it is important for the long-term vibrancy of our space program to think through what [ORG]'s core mission is and what the next great adventures and discoveries are under the [ORG] banner. [ORG] has yielded or the space shuttle program has yielded some extraordinary scientific discoveries. But I think it is fair to say that there is been a sense of drift to our space program over [DATE]. We need to restore that sense of excitement and interest that existed around the space program. And shaping a mission for [ORG] that is appropriate for [DATE] is going to be one of the biggest tasks of my new [ORG] director. Once we have that vision, then I think it is going to be much easier to build support for expanding our space efforts. But what I do not want [ORG] to do is just sort of limp along here. And I do not think that is good for the economy of the region either. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in appointing a [ORG] Administrator [DATE], were you signaling your intention to keep the agency as part of [ORG]? And now that you have sent some [ORG] members to [GPE], might we expect your presence in the city, perhaps even for [DATE] hurricane season? [INTERVIEWED]. I am just still trying to figure out my schedule for [DATE] so I do not want to get too far ahead of myself. Sending Secretary [PERSON] and [PERSON] signaled that we are going to be focused on [GPE] reconstruction, and we are going to be paying a lot of attention to the systems that are in place to protect from hurricanes in the future. And I what was the first question? [INTERVIEWER]. On [ORG], and whether [ORG] stays within [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED]. [ORG] I have not made a final decision on that. But whether [ORG] stays inside [ORG] or is once again a standalone agency, the [CARDINAL] thing you can be certain of is that it is going to do an outstanding job performing its tasks. And I think that the new director has gotten uniformly high grades. Whenever you got [PERSON], [PERSON], and [NORP] in [ORG] agreeing on somebody, they know what they are doing. [NORP] Opposition/High-Speed Rail [INTERVIEWER]. Thanks, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I wondered if, first, you could elaborate as a [INTERVIEWED] from [GPE], a little bit on your own vision for high-speed rail in the Midwest, particularly the idea of a [GPE]-to-[GPE]-to-[GPE] link. And then a completely unrelated political question, whether you are at all surprised by the degree of, sort of, discipline and unity we are seeing in a [NORP] opposition to your agenda right now? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me answer the political question first. I am not surprised, because opposition is always easy; saying no to something is easy. Saying yes to something and figuring out how to solve problems and governing, that is hard. And on this budget debate, for example, if you have got people who on the [CARDINAL] hand say, We want to bring down the long-term deficit, but we do not want to cut certain programs that are important. Oh, and by the way, we do not want to raise taxes well, sounds good. And I'd like to make sure that [ORG] win the championship [DATE] and [ORG] win the Series, but you know, show me how you are going to do it. So I am not impressed by just being able to say no. I think what will be interesting is the degree to which my [NORP] colleagues start putting forward in the form of an affirmative agenda that is not based on ideology, but on the very real struggles and pain that people are feeling right now around the country, and how do we get this economy back on its feet. In terms of high-speed rail, I think there is enormous opportunities here. Now, I would have loved to have seen more done on high-speed rail in the recovery package, because I think it is the right direction for us to go in. I could not credibly claim that all of the investments that are necessary are short term enough to be in a recovery package, as opposed to be part of our broader transportation bills and budget. But think about it. I mean, we have laid a transcontinental railway system during the Civil War. Railroads were always the pride of [GPE] and stitched us together. Now [GPE], [GPE], all of Europe have high-speed rail systems that put ours to shame. And the potential economic benefits of a high-speed rail link between [GPE] and [GPE], so that people are avoiding [FAC], or the length between [GPE] and [GPE], [GPE], all those [NORP] cities, I think is enormous, and is a very real option with although gas prices are low right now, it becomes a very meaningful option for people who do not want to take off their shoes, drive to an airport, pay for parking, suffer delays. So I think there is a very real opportunity. I should point out that the opportunities around the rail are not just in high-speed rail. I mean, there is some basic freight rail issues in [GPE], [GPE], the Midwest that can also be solved and would help with the whole distribution of goods in the region that would save business a lot of money. And I hope that we end up spending some time focused on that during the transportation reauthorization. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], thanks again for doing this. Given the worldwide context of the economic crisis you are dealing with, are the stimulus measures that you have championed, in your mind, sufficient to right the economy, absent similar actions by other large economies in the world? And if I could just turn the question around in a way, there are estimates of, like, [CARDINAL] have been plunged into poverty worldwide. Does the [GPE] do you have any interest in their situation, whether from the standpoint of self-interest, national security, or morality? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is a great question. I anticipated this question, even though I did not know you were going to ask it, [PERSON], [ORG]Gazette], because Secretary [PERSON] is now headed off to the [ORG] minister's meeting as a precursor to our [ORG]. And what we specifically talked about was, number [CARDINAL], our economic recovery is linked up to the economic recovery of the rest of the world and vice versa. Up until [DATE], exports were one of the few bright spots in our economy. The collapse of worldwide demand costs [NORP] jobs and [NORP] businesses. And so we want to work with other countries to make sure that they are promoting the kinds of fiscal stimulus packages that can boost demand in their countries. It is important that we do not fall into a protectionist mentality so that each country, even as it is stimulating, is also still promoting the kinds of trade that can help us all grow. And part of the [ORG] agenda is also thinking about the adverse impact that this global economic slowdown is having on the poorest of the poor. I think we have all of the above, a moral, national security, and economic interest in making sure that people in those countries are not suffering even more than they were already suffering, because that can be profoundly destabilizing in all sorts of ways. You know, there were a couple of questions about the border situation with [GPE]. You know, if [GPE]'s economy cannot provide a living wage of any sort to a growing [NORP] population that, obviously, is going to put more pressure on us in terms of immigration, more people being pushed into the drug trade, and so on. And that is just [CARDINAL] example. There are more severe examples of instability in places like North Africa in the face of drought or shortage of food supplies that can end up causing us real problems. So figuring out how the developed countries, wealthier countries, even in the midst of hardship, can provide some relief and assistance to those countries as well, I think, is going to be very important. All right? Okay, guys. You put me through the paces. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you much. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED]. I broke a sweat. [INTERVIEWER]. You did not break a sweat. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Take care.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreligiousaffairsjournalists", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am glad to see you all and welcome you here, for many of you, for the first time. As you know, in the State of the Union Address I issued a challenge, and as part of my explanation of the New Covenant in challenging citizens to be more responsible, to people of faith and to religious leaders specifically to help us to deal with those problems that we have to deal with person by person and from the inside out, to help us to deal with the problems of teen pregnancy and outof-wedlock birth, to help us to deal with the challenges of excessive violence, to help us to deal with the things that have to be organized and dealt with literally one by [CARDINAL] at the grassroots level. And while I think we have to be more tolerant of all people, no matter what their differences are, we need to be less tolerant of conditions that are within our power to change. And as you know now, for [DATE], ever since I took this job, I have been trying to find ways to galvanize the energies of people of faith to work together on a common agenda that nearly all [NORP] would agree on and, at the same time, to try to respect the differences of opinion and views. Our administration strongly supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and we have worked very hard to implement it in a good faith way. And I think an awful lot of people from right across the spectrum of religious affiliations in our country would agree that we have done that. Anyway, if you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer. But the other thing I was going to say [DATE] what I said [DATE] was that the problems our country faces [DATE] are quite profound, you know, the fact that a rising tide is not lifting all boats; that a lot of people, in spite of this remarkable recovery, have not gotten a raise and they are more vulnerable with their health care, their pensions; and the fact that a lot of people find their values violated and their security violated by crime and violence and the breakdown of the social order. It would be very hard to assert that there are more profound difficulties than the problems of [DATE], than the problems that [PERSON] or [PERSON] or [PERSON] confronted. The difference is that in the information age, which gives us these vast new opportunities because the creation of wealth is based on knowledge and that these people have access to more knowledge than ever before, it is also a great burden because words have greater power [DATE] than ever before, not only to build up but also to tear down, to divide, to destroy, to distract. And therefore, in a very profound sense in the modern world, it is more important that people be striving for the kind of spiritual presence of mind and peace of mind that will lead you to use words to build up and to unify, instead of to divide and tear down. And I really do believe that. I think that it is clearly different from any previous time. Words have always been able to wound in letters or speeches or whatever. But the omnipresence of information [DATE] and the fact that we are buried in it, it seems to me, imposes an even greater responsibility on people in positions of respect and trust and power to use those words more carefully. [INTERVIEWER]. An awkward question, sir. The moral crusade elements of the State of the Union Address, teenage pregnancy, as an example, sits well, except that there are investigations into your own conduct which some people say leaves an impression. Is this interfering with your ability to lead that type of crusade? [INTERVIEWED]. Not in my own mind. That is up for other people to determine. But the [CARDINAL] thing that I would say [DATE] we live in an age where anybody can say anything and, unlike in previous times, it gets into print. And even if they admit they took money to say it which is what happened in my case a couple of times it still gets wide currency. So there is not much I can do about that. I can tell you this: The work I have tried to do to reduce teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births generally is something I have been involved in for [DATE]. And I think it is a very serious matter. The life of these young people was very, very different than my life was when I was their age. Their temptations, their travails, it is very, very different and much more difficult for them. And I think we have got to try to find a way to help them walk back from what is now happening. Interestingly enough this is a statistical comment I am making now there is some evidence that the efforts may be beginning to have some impact. The actual numbers of out-of-wedlock births have stabilized in [DATE]. The rate of illegitimacy is going up because the rate of childbearing by couples who are young and successful is going down, which is another problem for another discussion. But anyway, I do not see that we have any choice as a people to deal with it, and it is and you know, if folks want to use that as another excuse to attack me, that is their problem, not mine. [INTERVIEWER]. Related to that, some people suggest that both your welfare reform proposals and the Contract With America's welfare reform proposal takes such Draconian measures against these unwed teen mothers in terms of limits that what it is likely to do is to drive up the abortion rate, not stop the unwanted pregnancy rate but drive up the abortion rate. Do you see that happening? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not agree with that in my proposal, and obviously I do not know what would happen in the others, but let us look at that. The abortion rate has been going down in [GPE]. And I think it is been going down for maybe because of all the protest against abortion. But I also think that most [NORP] have deeply ambivalent feelings. That is, I believe that a majority of [NORP] are pro-choice and anti-abortion. That is, they do not believe that the decision should be criminalized because there are too many different circumstances where most of us feel that decisions should be left to the people who are involved rather than having a totally legal prohibition. On the other hand, most people think in most circumstances that abortion is wrong and that it should not be done. So the abortion rate is going down in [GPE]. It is still very much too high, and we have tried to do some things to make adoption more attractive. And there was a law signed [DATE], that is gotten almost no notice because it was part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to try to remove the prohibitions or the discriminations in courts across the country in cross-racial adoptions to try to do whatever we could to just encourage more adoptions. But let me back up to your question and to explain, if I might, why I do not agree that our position would cause more abortions. There are basically [CARDINAL] different approaches, with [CARDINAL] limitations, but [CARDINAL] different approaches in this welfare debate. There is the Contract approach which is deny benefits to the second welfare child born out of wedlock. And then this extreme version is deny benefits to any teenager who has a child out of wedlock and to that child for [DATE]. That is what then there is the people who say, turn it over to the [GPE] and let them do whatever they want, which could include that. Our position is give the [GPE] a lot more flexibility, but do not punish the children; take care of their basic needs. And we say do not cut the parents off of public assistance unless, number [CARDINAL], they are bad parents or, number [CARDINAL], they do things which will undermine their ability to either be successful workers or successful parents. So for example, the way our plan works is if you are a teenager and you have a baby, in order to draw the public assistance in a normal way you'd have to stay in school, you'd have to live at home with your parents, and if you lived in a bad home you'd have to live in some other supervised setting. You'd have to cooperate and help identify the father so we could attempt to get the father to pay child support and support the child. If at the end of your education period and training, if [DATE] have elapsed and you have not gone to work, then you would have to go to work if there were a job available. And if you turned down a job, you could lose your benefits. Under their proposal, the second problem is, you'd be cut off after [DATE] whether there is a job there or not. So the [CARDINAL] differences are, I say cut people off after a limited amount of time if there is a job there. They say cut them off altogether. I say only take benefits away from people if they misbehave as parents or in their own responsibilities. They say if you have a child out of wedlock and you are a teenager, you should never get benefits and neither should your child. I will leave it to you to conclude what impact that might have on the abortion rate; I do not know. But I do not believe ours would. I think ours is responsible. You have to have more requirements on people; you cannot just continue to perpetuate the present system. But I do not think you should punish the children or punish people for their past mistakes. You should deal with their present conduct. [INTERVIEWER]. What about the suggestion that, particularly of Speaker [PERSON], that the churches and the charities should be able to take over much of the responsibility, including the financial responsibility that the Government now has for foster children and various other tough social situations? Is that an appropriate way for these problems to be taken care of, for these people to be cared for? And if so, how should the money get there? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the churches could well be involved in more activities. For example, I think that you might and one of the things that I want to do is to give more flexibility in how to implement welfare reform to [ORG] and local government. If they want to involve the church, particularly, for example, in developing supervised settings for young girls and their children who cannot , and should not , be living in their homes because of the problems in their homes, that is the sort of partnership that I would certainly not oppose. But I do not think you can say from that that there is no national interest which should command some taxpayer support to make sure that these children have minimal levels of nutrition and medical care and just the basic things that it seems to me we have got an interest in doing, because we do not want to lose any more of these kids than we have to. The welfare benefits themselves, by the way, are not a problem. The real welfare benefits are about [PERCENT] lower than they were [DATE]. So nobody goes on welfare for the check. It is the child care; it is the food stamps; it is the medical care for your children. Therefore, nearly anybody who can will get off and go to work if they can take care of their children and their children will not lose their health care. But do I think the churches should do more? I do. And one of the things that we want to do is to give more operational control of this program to the [GPE] and let them use churches or community organizations or others to do whatever they can to repair the families. [INTERVIEWER]. Much of what the churches already do for instance, [ORG], their money comes from contracts through [ORG] agencies. In essence, what some of the [NORP] proposals are asking them to do is to continue doing the sort of work but without those contracts, without the money. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it will just be harder for them, will not it? I mean, I think I mean, [PERSON] is a good example. The Government does not we are not a particularly generous country in terms of social welfare. The thing I do not think the [NORP] people object to spending tax money on poor people. I think what they object to is spending tax money on a system that perpetuates destructive conduct and irresponsible conduct. I think that the issue is for example, I do not think most [NORP] really think that it would be a great idea to cut out all spending on poor children in order to afford a capital gains tax cut. I do not think that is where they would come down. On the other hand, would they rather have a tax cut or just waste money on any program, including a program that perpetuated dependency? I think they would or reduce the deficit or whatever. So I think the what my goal is, is to say there is a national interest in the health and welfare of our children. I think it requires some investment of taxpayer money in the areas of particularly basic health care and nutrition and immunization of children against serious diseases. But the systems are dysfunctional. So I think we ought to try to fix them. [INTERVIEWER]. In a meeting of [NORP] leaders back in [DATE] you were asked a question about some of your critics who were attacking you with unsubstantiated charges. I am thinking specifically of Reverend [PERSON] pushing a video on his TV program. And your response to the question was that you were busy running the country and did not want to respond to your critics, but you were surprised that the [NORP] community was not taking these men on. Since that time, I know [NORP] Baptist [PERSON] was asked for equal time on his show to try to defend you. But do you know of any other attempts like that, or anything since that time to try to answer some [INTERVIEWED]. There have been an awful lot of attempts I think there have been a lot of press stories refuting some of the specific allegations. But I would just say again, in the world we are living in I will say what I said at the prayer breakfast [DATE] there is an inordinate premium put on the use of words to destroy or to distract people. And it takes away from my ability to be [INTERVIEWED], to do the job with a clear head and a clear heart and to focus on the [NORP] people, if I have to spend all my time trying to answer charges about what people say that I did [DATE]. And I just cannot do it; I just cannot do it. I do the very best I can. Sometimes you can actually disprove something someone says about you. A lot of times, some people could lie about you in ways that you cannot disprove. You cannot always disprove every assertion. So insofar as whatever happened, I cannot change [DATE], I can only change [DATE] and [DATE]. So I have just got to keep going. I think it is I think I have if I'd done anything, even though I have tried not to deal with it at all, I think whatever time I have spent kind of trying to absorb those blows since I have been [INTERVIEWED] has been time and effort and energy, emotional as well as intellectual energy, has taken away from the [NORP] people. And I am not going to cheat them anymore; I am just not going to do it. I am tired of letting other people say things that require me to deprive the [NORP] people of the best effort I can make. They will have to make whatever evaluation of this they want to. There is a difference between reputation and character, and I have increasingly less control over my reputation but still full control over my character. That is between me and God, and I have just got to try to be purified by this. I also noticed, [PERSON] said I ran across this [DATE] that just because someone strays from the truth in criticizing you does not mean you cannot learn something from their criticism. So I have decided that I will try need to learn a little something from my critics, even if what they say is not so. None of us are perfect, and I am certainly not. But I just cannot I really think I made the right decision to try to just tune it out and go forward. [INTERVIEWER]. Is there a place in the Scriptures where you find a source for the kind of faith you talked about earlier and stillness in facing these things, a story or a parable or a reading that you have turned to? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, it is interesting, I just finished reading the entire Psalms. I also read this is ironic [PERSON] book on the Psalms that I did not I read it before he was selected to be Chaplain of the [ORG]. And there are a lot of the Psalms where [PERSON] is sort of praying for the strength to be sort of purified in the face of adversity and in the face of his own failures. There are a lot of the Proverbs which talk about the importance of keeping a quiet tongue and at least not getting in your own way, which I have done a lot in my life and which I have tried, even still, to grow out of. And I have spent a lot of time dealing with that over [DATE], as you would imagine I would have to. I think the important thing, and I find this in the Scriptures over and over again, the important thing that I have to keep focusing on is what am I going to do [DATE], what am I going to do [DATE], how can I be free to call on the power of God to make the most of this job that I have for a little bit of time in the grand sweep of things. And that is just what I keep focusing on [DATE]. But I think you'd be amazed how many people write me little fax notes, from friends of mine on a [DATE] basis, saying look at this Scripture, look at that Scripture, look at the other Scripture. During this difficult period, a lot of people were giving me different Psalms to read it was amazing and so I did. [INTERVIEWER]. Sir, when you talk about destructive language, if you you refer to personal attacks on yourself. But what about some of the uncivil language which has been so much in the news over [DATE] that has been in [ORG]? Are you including that in [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. I said [DATE] at the prayer breakfast, I do not think anybody in public life, including me, is blameless. I think it is that there are general excuse me, genuine differences that people have on issues, and they ought to express them. But our public life needs more of the spirit of reconciliation, it needs more civility, it needs more humility. Sometimes we think we know things we do not . And I think on debates over public issues, that is true as well. The [NORP] people very much want us to they respond to these negative things, but they do not like it. The reason it keeps happening is because they respond to it. The politicians read polls, you know, and they know very often that the negative campaigns work and elect people. And they know that if you just constantly demean and run down people, like, after a while it sticks. They know that, so they keep on doing it. And the people respond to it, but they hate it. It is almost saying, I wish you'd lock this liquor store up so I could not drink anymore. And so somehow we have to crawl back off of this wedge because it has, as I said, it is [DATE] people get more information that is sort of argumentative and editorial and often less accurate, and then get in a more negative context than ever before. And it is a function of the information explosion. And so I do believe that I and others have a heavier responsibility even than we might have had in a former time, when in order to just get people's attention, you might take a little license with your language, you know. [INTERVIEWER]. proven through the words and your actions that you are a genuinely religious person, since you were very young, and your wife as well. And a lot of religious people I talk to do not seem to accept that, who do not seem to feel it is genuine, feel that you are using it in the course of making politics. And I am wondering why, if you believe that, too, and if you any analysis as to why that is and what it might say about the role of religion in politics, whether they really ought to be bound together [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think they should be bound together. I mean, I think the First Amendment is a good thing for our country, that we protect the right of everybody to be faithful to whatever they believe by not uniting church and state. But I do not think you can change people or who they are. They have the convictions they have. They have the beliefs they have. And what I have tried to do is to draw the proper balance by encouraging people of all faiths, including people who disagree with me, to be activist citizens. I think the the book that [PERSON] wrote on that, he makes a better statement about that than I can make, in terms of why they do not accept that about me. I think it is hard to make a case that I have tried to use this. I have never tried to say that for example, I never tried to say that there was a [NORP] coalition behind anything I did, you know, that God had ordained us to do these following things and I knew it, and anybody that did not was seized by the Devil. I never said that. I have said that like every other person, I consider myself a sinner because I believe I consider myself forgiven. I consider you know, I need the power of God. This is a humble thing for me. But it is an important part of my life and has been for a long time, but especially again in [DATE] and before I became [INTERVIEWED]. And the same thing is true for [PERSON]. I think the truth is that there are people who do not believe it is genuine because they disagree with me politically. They do not believe that you could be a committed [NORP] and not want to criminalize all abortions. I just do not believe you can be that is what they think. They do not believe that you could be a committed [NORP] and believe that take the position that I took on gays in the military. They thought think the Bible dictated the previous policy on gays in the military, even though we fought [CARDINAL] World Wars, [GPE], and [GPE] with a different policy. But they do not believe that. That is their conviction. So then I think there are people, once they disagree with you so much, who will believe who will believe in perpetuating anything anybody says about you, and so they think that is evidence of that. But you know, the Bible is full of refutations of the latter point. All they had to do was read the Scripture to know better than to make that argument. But I cannot worry about them; that is their problem. Let them think what they want. I literally you know, the [CARDINAL] thing I realize is, is I wasted too much time when I got here, and it caused me to be a less effective [INTERVIEWED], either being hurt by or paying a great deal of attention to what people said about me in the past. And I have just got to try to keep going and fight against it, because the people that wanted to really blow that up either wanted to do it for their own purposes or wanted to do it literally without regard to whether [ORG] functions or the public interest is furthered. It is just a crazy way to behave; you cannot do it. It never happened before in our history to this extent, and it should not be happening now. And if it is happening, I cannot control it. So what I should do is just do my job and shut it out; that is what I have to do. [INTERVIEWER]. Sir, do you think that religious groups such as [ORG] risk their credibility by wholesale endorsement of the Contract With America? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that is for others to judge, I think, but I would say this: You know, I think that they will come to be seen more and more like a political party with an agenda, rather than people who are driven into politics based on [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] issues that they believe the Bible dictates a position different from the present policy of [GPE]. And there are a lot of [NORP] political parties with the name [NORP] in them, [ORG] in [GPE], [PERSON] party. Nobody considers him to be, how should I say, sacrilegious because he is part of a party called [ORG] that has religious roots, but no one anymore seriously believes that every position they take is rooted in their reading of the Scripture. And I think that [ORG] is long since at that point. Now, the thing I do think they have to be careful about with their credibility is the very, very hard hits they put on office holders who do not do as they believe. I remember [CARDINAL] of the Members of [ORG] who lost in the last election told me of an encounter with a [ORG] minister who said to this Member, Well, you want to see what we are going to put out in our churches on [DATE], [DATE]? And she said, Yes, I'd like to see it. And she went to these [CARDINAL] items; she said, But these [CARDINAL] things are not true. He said, So, it is generally true. So what? So I think that that could hurt their credibility more than anything else, the idea that they are using the emotions of people of faith who are deeply disturbed for good reasons with what is going on in our country [DATE] and channeling those emotions into convictions about people in public life that are not true. Now, that could hurt their credibility. But I think just taking positions on these other things, I think everybody knows that they basically are an arm of [ORG] and that they are going to take all these positions. I do not see that there is anything wrong with them doing it. And I agree with some of them, too. You know, I do not disagree with everything in that Contract; I agree with some of it. Did everybody get a question? I am glad to see you. [INTERVIEWER]. It is good to see you. [INTERVIEWED]. Thanks. Do you ever wish you were back in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWER]. [DATE] when I am driving out to [GPE] for [TIME]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. It is pretty out there. I had a woman [DATE] from [GPE] come sing at the prayer breakfast. It made me so homesick I could hardly stand it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone0", "text": "[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you all for coming. A couple of points I want to make to you. First, I am excited about the energy initiative. [NORP] people are beginning to see that we have made good progress on research and development. We have got more to do. We are close to some breakthroughs that will achieve an economic and national security objective. And I have enjoyed traveling around and talking to these scientists and engineers that are really excited about how close we are to some technological breakthroughs. [DATE], talking to the [CARDINAL] scientists involved with the cellulosic ethanol projects was exciting. These guys are pretty fired up about it all, and they realize we have got a chance to change our driving habits. I do want to talk about this port issue. A foreign company manages some of our ports. They have entered into a transaction with another foreign company to manage our ports. This is a process that has been extensively reviewed, particularly from the point of view as to whether or not I can say to the [NORP] people, This project will not jeopardize our security. It is been looked at by those who have been charged with the security of our country. And I believe the deal should go forward. This company operates all around the world. I have the list somewhere. We can get you the list. They are in [GPE] and elsewhere-[GPE]. They-in working with our folks, they have agreed to make sure that their coordination with our security folks is good and solid. I really do not understand why it is okay for a [NORP] company to operate our ports but not a company from the Middle East, when our experts are convinced that port security is not an issue; that having worked with this company, they are convinced that these-they will work with those who are in charge of [ORG] responsibility for securing the ports-they will work hand in glove. I want to remind people that when we first put out the Container Security Initiative, the [ORG], which was a new way to secure our ports, [GPE] was [CARDINAL] of the first countries to sign up. In other words, we are receiving goods from ports out of the [GPE] as well as where this company operates. And so I, after careful review of our Government, I believe the Government ought to go forward. And I want those who are questioning it to step up and explain why all of a sudden a [NORP] company is held to a different standard than a [NORP] company. I am trying to conduct foreign policy now by saying to people of the world, We will treat you fairly. And after careful scrutiny, we believe this deal is a legitimate deal that will not jeopardize the security of the country and, at the same time, send that signal that we are willing to treat people fairly. Thirdly, I am looking forward to my speech [DATE] about my trip to [GPE] and [GPE]. It is going to be an important trip, one where we will work on a variety of issues with both countries-security, prosperity, and trade-working with [GPE], of course, on energy security. It will be an important trip. I will answer some questions, and then we are getting ready to land. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], leaders in [ORG], including Senator [PERSON], have said that they will take action to stop the port control shift if you do not reverse course on it. You have expressed your thoughts here, but what do you say to those in [ORG] who plan to take legislative action? [INTERVIEWED]. They ought to listen to what I have to say about this. They ought to look at the facts and understand the consequences of what they are going to do. But if they pass a law, I will deal with it, with a veto. Crude Oil Supply/Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], on energy and foreign policy, some [NORP] officials have said they are unhappy with being targeted about Middle Eastern oil, saying that you wanted to reduce dependence on Middle East oil. You have got a close relationship with King [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED]. I do. [INTERVIEWER]. He is been to see you. Have you heard something directly, yourself, from the [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, I have not talked to [PERSON], but if I did, I would say, I hope you can understand that the relationship between supply and demand is so tight that any disruption on the supply side of energy causes our prices to go up, and spiking prices hurts our economy. And secondly, there are parts of the world where people would-that do not agree with our policy, namely [GPE], for example. And that it is not in our interest to be dependent, when it comes to our economic security, and for that matter, national security, in a market that is volatile. And so hopefully, he will understand. [INTERVIEWER]. So you do not think they should take offense at the comments about [NORP] oil? [INTERVIEWED]. I would think that he would be understanding that new technologies will enable us to diversify away from our reliance upon crude oil. As a matter of fact, it is not only a message for [GPE]; that is also a message for [GPE] and [GPE]. In order for these growing economies to be able to be competitive, they are going to have to learn how to use technologies that will enable them to meet the needs of their people, but also the international demands of the world for good environment, for example. The Nuclear Energy Initiative I will be talking to the [NORP] about is an important initiative. [ORG]/Homeland Security [INTERVIEWER]. The understatement [DATE], and one of the concerns of lawmakers, seems to be that they want more of a briefing, and they want more details about the things that you know that have given you confidence that there are not any national security implications with the port deal. Are you willing to either have your staff or to give any kind of briefing to leaders of Congress-- [INTERVIEWED]. Look at the company's record, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], and it is clear for everybody to see. We have looked at the ports in which they have operated. There is a standard process mandated by [ORG] that we go through called the CFIUS process. I am not exactly sure if there is any national security concerns in briefing [ORG]. I just do not know. I cannot answer your question. [INTERVIEWER]. It seems like-you have already heard from different administration officials, saying, not in as strong terms as you have [DATE], that there are not problems with this deal, that the deal should go forward. But they seem to want more of a briefing. Would you be willing to give any additional briefings, either-- [INTERVIEWED]. We will be glad to send-- [INTERVIEWER]. --either in a classified basis or-- [INTERVIEWED]. I do not see why not. Again, you are asking-I need to make sure I understand exactly what they are asking for. Yes. Oh, you are not the press. Counselor to the [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]. I could ask a question. You showed some strong leadership today-[laughter]. [INTERVIEWER]. Why is it so important to you, sir, that you take on this issue as a political fight? Clearly, there is bipartisan-- [INTERVIEWED]. I do not view it as a political fight. So do you want to start your question over? I view it as a good policy. [INTERVIEWER]. Why is it-clearly-- [INTERVIEWED]. Are you talking about the energy issue? [INTERVIEWER]. No, I am sorry, the ports issue. [INTERVIEWED]. It is not a political issue. [INTERVIEWER]. But there clearly are members of your own party who will go to the mat against you on this. [INTERVIEWED]. It is not a political issue. [INTERVIEWER]. Why are you-to make this, to have this fight? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not view it as a fight. I view it as me saying to people what I think is right, the right policy. [INTERVIEWER]. What is the larger message that you are conveying by sticking to this [GPE] contract, by saying that you are not going to budge on this or you do not want to change policy? [INTERVIEWED]. There is a process in place where we analyze-where the Government analyzes many, many business transactions to make sure they meet national security concerns. And I am sure if you-careful review, this process yielded a result that said, yes, a deal should go forward. One of my concerns, however, is mixed messages. And the message is, It is okay for a [NORP] company, but a [NORP] company-maybe we ought not to deal the same way. It is a mixed message. You put interesting words in your question, but I just view-my job is to do what I think is right for the country. I do not intend to have a fight. If there is a fight, there is one but-nor do I view this as a political issue. [INTERVIEWER]. I say it because you said you'd be willing to use the veto on it. [INTERVIEWED]. I would. That is one of the tools the [INTERVIEWED] has to indicate to the legislative branch his intentions. A veto does not mean fight or politics; it is just one of the tools I have got. I say veto, by the way, quite frequently in messages to [ORG]. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], [GPE] is halting payments to the [NORP]-the tax monies. What do you think about that, and what is the next step? [INTERVIEWED]. I will just give you our Government's position, and that is, we have said that-well, first of all, [ORG] does not give direct grants to [GPE]. We go through [ORG]. We go through-we give grants through [ORG] from our [ORG] to help people. But my statement still stands, that so long as [ORG] does not recognize [GPE]'s right to exist, my view is, we do not have a partner in peace and, therefore, should not fund a government that is not a partner in peace. I thought the elections were important. I was [CARDINAL] voice that said the elections should go forward on time. But I recognized that, [CARDINAL], elections are the first step in many cases in evolution of a true democracy; and secondly, that elections show-give everybody a true look at how-what people are thinking on the street; and thirdly, though, that because the [NORP] spoke, does not necessarily mean we have to agree with the nature of-the party elected. And the party elected has said, We are for the destruction of [GPE]. And our policy is, [CARDINAL] states living side by side in peace. And therefore, it is hard to have a state living side by side in peace when your stated objective is the destruction of [CARDINAL] of the states. So my policy still stands, what I said [DATE] after the [NORP] elections. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Can I ask you about a domestic issue, the prescription drug benefit plan? A lot of [NORP] are on recess, and they want to make a big campaign issue out of this [DATE]. What makes you think that the problems that this program being rolled out has had are something other than just the glitches that you have described? [INTERVIEWED]. I am glad that they are making this an issue. This is-the reforms that we passed in the [ORG] law were necessary and are going to change people's lives in a positive way. And I look forward to talking about this issue [DATE], if that is one of the issues they want to talk about, because I understand the impact that this law is going to have on seniors. And [CARDINAL] have signed up, and [CARDINAL] are realizing the benefit of this program. And so it is -we have done the right thing in passing this law. Seniors are given different options. Seniors are going to get an extraordinarily good drug benefit. We have helped modernize [ORG]. And looking forward to talking about it. Good.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone1", "text": "Pope [PERSON] Funeral [INTERVIEWED]. Listen, were you there in person? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL], I am really glad I came. There was never any question I would come. [TIME] we hosted a reception at the [FAC] for many of the leaders of [ORG] at home, and they were very grateful that I came and [PERSON] came and [PERSON] came and [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] came and [PERSON] came as well as others. And I told them, to a person, that it is such an honor to represent our country at a ceremony honoring a truly great man who is and will always be a great historical figure. I knew the ceremony [DATE] would be majestic, but I did not realize how moved I would be by the service, itself, by the beautiful music. I was struck-as an aside-struck by the fact that the sound was so clear in this huge facility. It was as if we were inside the cathedral listening, and the voices were so pure. I thought the homily was really good. We were given an English version, fortunately-if you have not read it, maybe you have seen it? Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautifully done. I was struck by the response of the crowd. And I think it is interesting to note the moments where the crowd responded. [CARDINAL] in particular is when His Eminence spoke to His Holiness's relationship to the young of the world, and there was a great outpouring of enthusiasm for that line. And then I think the thing that struck all our delegation most intensely was the final scene of the plain-looking casket-[CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL], by the way, lead, wood, and wood- being carried and held up for the seal to be seen, and then the sun pouring out. This will be one of the highlights of my Presidency, to have been at this great ceremony. So off we go to home now. Pope [PERSON] Legacy [INTERVIEWER]. Your predecessor suggested that the Pope would leave a mixed legacy, even though he was a great man. Since you differed with him on the war to such a great degree, do you also think it will be a mixed legacy? [INTERVIEWED]. I think Pope [PERSON] will have a clear legacy of peace, compassion, and a strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone. Upcoming Meeting With [NORP] Prime Minister [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. You are going to see Prime Minister [PERSON] soon. There is been some talk in [GPE] that maybe you are not going to raise this issue of this latest settlement expansion. Are you going to do that? [INTERVIEWED]. I have raised the issue of settlement expansions publicly. I mean, it was upon the prompting of your question. You bet. What I say publicly, I say privately. And that is, the roadmap has clear obligations on settlements and that we expect the Prime Minister to adhere to those roadmap obligations. And the roadmap has got obligations for the [NORP]. We have a great opportunity- we, the world, has a great opportunity to help a democracy grow-begin and grow, starting in the [GPE]. The Prime Minister of [GPE] has decided to pull out of [GPE]. As you know, I applauded that decision at [FAC], with him standing by my side. And I think now is the time to focus the world's attention on what is possible. And we have already started that process of realizing the possible by having General [PERSON] work with the [NORP] to streamline and coordinate [NORP] security forces so that, upon the withdrawal of [NORP] forces from [GPE], there is a security presence that will protect people. We have got to do more. We have got to make sure that an economy can flourish there. [INTERVIEWER]. So you are going to try to talk him out of this latest settlement expansion he is talking about? [INTERVIEWED]. My position is clear, and I will-I stated, obviously, now the second time in a brief period of time, and I will say so privately as well. I think you need to know what the successful strategy will be. And that is there is more than just security in [GPE]. We need to have institution-building, and there needs to be an international effort that encourages and fosters economic vitality so that a government which does emerge in [GPE] will be able to better speak to the hopes of those who live in the [GPE]. And success in the [GPE] will make success on [GPE] easier. And so [CARDINAL] of our- I will be talking to the Prime Minister about the need to work with the [NORP] Government, [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], to facilitate success, to enhance success. Let me make sure I go back to the first answer on His Holiness. I said-I think my answer was, is that-what did I say? Pope [PERSON] Legacy [INTERVIEWER]. I asked if you thought it was a mixed message, and you said, I think [PERSON] will have a clear legacy of peace. [INTERVIEWED]. A clear and excellent legacy, if you do not mind adding the word excellent. [INTERVIEWER]. Clear and excellent. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. In other words, a strong legacy. I wanted to make sure there was a proper adjective to the legacy I thought he left behind. It was more than just clear. [ORG] Secretary [PERSON]. You said strong, too, in that answer. [INTERVIEWED]. Okay. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes, you said strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone. [INTERVIEWED]. Fine. Okay, good. Democracy in the Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. Getting back to the Middle East for a moment, there have been hopeful signs in the region lately. But some in the region think that some of our allies there, particularly [GPE] and [GPE], still are not doing enough to help foster democracy in their own countries. Do you think they are doing enough, or are you encouraging them to-- [INTERVIEWED]. We will continue to encourage democracy. But I also have said many times that it is important for those of us who live in a democratic society to remember [CARDINAL] things: [CARDINAL], our own road to democracy was a little bumpy; we have a Constitution and a Declaration of Independence but, nevertheless, had slavery for a long period of time, for example. And secondly, that we should not expect others to adapt that which we think-we should not try to impose our democracy on other nations. What we should say is, We will work with you to develop a democracy which adapts to your own cultures and your own religions and your own habits. I am fully aware that there is work to be done. But I think it is also our job to encourage those nations and, at the same time, recognize that all nations are not starting at the same spot in order to achieve democracy. I mean, [GPE], it is very important for us in [GPE] to recognize that we-we transferred sovereignty [DATE]. Remember we all traveled to NATO- to the [ORG] summit? And it may seem like [DATE] to you all-[laughter]-but [DATE] in the greater scheme of things is a short period of time. And nevertheless, during that short period of time, the [NORP] have voted, and [DATE] they have announced their Prime Minister. The Government will be up and running, [ORG] there, to write a constitution. In other words, things are happening quite rapidly, which is positive. But nevertheless, there is a certain- there is got to be a certain realism about how fast things can possibly happen, given where different nations have started from. Now, I will continue to press forward on encouraging democracy and reform in every nation, because I believe that is the ultimate strategy to defeat the terrorists. In the short run, we will continue to find them and work with nations to find them and share intelligence to find them, bring them to justice. In the long term, the spread of freedom and democracy-democracies reflecting the nature of the people and the history of those countries will mean that generations will more likely grow up in peace. Pope [PERSON] Funeral [INTERVIEWER]. When you sat there surrounded by that incredibly-array of world leaders and looked forward to the kind of spread of democracy you are talking about, is there something about just that assemblage there? Who did you talk to? Who did you see? And did it strike you that this was a remarkable ability to pull together such disparate people? [INTERVIEWED]. I was most attentive to the ceremony, itself, and was amazed by the size of the crowd. We came walking out of the grand stairway, and it was a very inspiring sight. [INTERVIEWER]. And the flags. [INTERVIEWED]. And the flags and the statues and just-yes, the bishops and the archbishops and different leaders of the churches right across the way from me. Of course, the cardinals-you know, a handful of whom I know, have gotten to know quite well and admire greatly, by the way. So that was pretty well my focus there. When I first got there-when [PERSON] and I first got there, we shook hands with the folks around us. Obviously, [PERSON] and Madam [PERSON] were right next door; I spent some time visiting with them. But everybody there was-there was not much chitchat. There was intense focus on the ceremony. [INTERVIEWER]. But what it represented, to have that many people-- [INTERVIEWED]. No, I understand. I believe that is part of the power of Pope [PERSON]. And he was such a believer in freedom. I saw [PERSON], for example. I was struck by the number of [NORP] flags that were in the crowd. You know what was really interesting? There were some signs urging that [PERSON] be made a saint. [INTERVIEWER]. Now! [INTERVIEWED]. Now, yes- subito. You know, I really did not reflect that much on the politics of the moment during the ceremony. I was more-I thought a lot about Pope [PERSON]. I mean, here is a person who has shown that a single individual can make a big difference in history and that, in my judgment, he received his great power and strength from the Almighty. [INTERVIEWER]. Just to follow up on that, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], a couple questions about the Pope. [CARDINAL], I noticed at [CARDINAL] point you had your glasses on, and you were following along- I am not sure if you were looking at the homily at that point or maybe, did you have [CARDINAL] of those guides that-- [INTERVIEWED]. I did. It is hard to follow- my Spanish is not very good-[laughter]- nevertheless, it is decent enough to pick up sounds that then can help me follow the [NORP]. [INTERVIEWER]. Had you ever been to a [NORP] mass before? I imagine you have been to an [NORP] mass. [INTERVIEWED]. No, never been to a [NORP] mass. [INTERVIEWER]. The other question was, we never had a chance to-you talked about a lot about what struck you from this ceremony. We never got a chance to talk to you about, by contrast, how you were struck by the wake, if you will, when you went through [TIME]. How do the [CARDINAL] ceremonies-you know, different kinds of emotions in the [CARDINAL]? [INTERVIEWED]. I felt-I mean, obviously, we were surrounded by a crowd at the wake, but I felt-when I was kneeling there, I felt-I am trying to think of the right word- alone is not the right word, because I was aware of people, but felt much more in touch with a spirit. I really did. I was very much-felt at peace there and was prayerful. And at the other ceremony, it was probably just because of all the sights and sounds and majesty and colors that, you know, I felt more like a spectator than a participant, but more of a spectator. [INTERVIEWER]. You knew him personally, I mean, to kneel there and see his body after you have met with him so many times and had- I mean, that must have been quite powerful and-- [INTERVIEWED]. My relationship with Pope [PERSON] was a very good relationship. He was such a gentle man, and at the end of his life he made his points to me with his eyes. The last visit, as you know, he was pretty physically-he was struggling, and yet his eyes twinkled, just real clear. Much of the communications was done by paperwork, which-- [INTERVIEWER]. Did he speak English? [INTERVIEWED]. Some, but it was hard to really understand him because he was struggling. That is why it is really interesting for people to note that there was a lot of testimony-and in my remarks, I tried to witness that as well-that his struggle at the end of his life and the dignity with which he struggled was a clear example of [PERSON]'s influence in his life. I was honored to see that firsthand. He is one of the great vigorous leaders-mountain climber, educator, instructor-who then had to struggle using the very tools that enabled him to be a vigorous teacher, outdoorsman, freedom fighter, and yet, nevertheless, he still could communicate clearly through eyes which were, you know, crystal clear. And I remember [FAC], when [PERSON] and I went to visit him. And he took us out on the balcony. The [FAC] overlooks this fantastic lake; it is a spectacular lake. And he was much more conversant then. I think it might have been my first trip? [INTERVIEWER]. It was [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Right before or after [GPE], [ORG] in [GPE]. And he had a sparkle; he really wanted to show us this beautiful setting. I would define Pope [PERSON] as a clear thinker who was like a rock. And tides of moral relativism kind of washed around him, but he stood strong as a rock. And that is why [CARDINAL]-one of the reasons why [CARDINAL] came to admire and love him. I was asked by some of the leadership of the [ORG], was I surprised at the turnout? I said, Not at all, because [CARDINAL] from all religions, [CARDINAL] of [NORP] and [CARDINAL] of others admired his strength and his purpose and his moral clarity. [INTERVIEWER]. How did the Pope struggle with his health at the end of his life and his example throughout his life strengthen your own faith? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, it is as- clear example of [PERSON]'s influence in a person's life that he maintained such a kind of hopeful, optimistic, clear point of view amidst struggles-in his case, physical struggles. And that is -a lot of [NORP] gain great strength and confidence from seeing His Holiness in the last stages of life. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think that will help you in [DATE] ahead, in your own life? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think all of us get touched in different ways if you are on a faith journey-we are all affected differently. But yes, I think my relationship with-and Pope [PERSON]'s example will serve-will be a moment in my life that will strengthen my faith and my belief- not just me, more significantly, [CARDINAL] of people whose life he touched. I think we might have witnessed-I do not know-perhaps the largest funeral in the history of mankind. I am not sure if that is true or not; somebody said that might be true. But there is a reason why the largest crowd ever to come and pay homage to a human happened, and it is because of the man's character, his views, his positions, his leadership capacity, his ability to relate to all people, his deep compassion, his love of peace. There is a reason why. Again, I repeat, I was honored to be one of many there, and I know you all were as well. Besides the pomp and the majesty and the colors, there was a spirit that was an integral part of the ceremony. For me, the spirit was also at the wake, but more personal at the wake. That was a personal moment. [INTERVIEWED]'s Faith [INTERVIEWER]. If there was ever a moment where you ever had any doubts in your own faith, what out of the past public things would strengthen your resolve and firm up your relationship with your God? [INTERVIEWED]. I think a walk in faith constantly confronts doubt, as faith becomes more mature. And you constantly confront, you know, questions. My faith is strong. The Bible talks about, you have got to constantly stay in touch with the Word of God in order to help you on the walk. But the Lord works in mysterious ways, and during all our life's journeys, we are enabled to see the Lord at work if our eyes are open and our hearts are open. And [DATE]-you can analyze, and you can look at the coffin being held, with the sun shining on it, anyway you want. I happen to feel it was a special moment that was part of a special ceremony for a special person. And it helped strengthen my faith. And you can have your faith strengthened on- you can have your faith strengthened when you stand up at a faith-based initiative and see someone standing up and testify to what their love has done to help a child or how a child's life has been helped. My faith gets strengthened when I went to the school [DATE] and saw the mentoring relationship between a young professional woman and a young kid who is going to go to [ORG] where there is a [PERCENT] chance that kid is going to go to college. And that helps strengthen my faith. So there is , you know, ways-whether the moment be majestical or whether the moment be a part of just an average-your average moment in life, you can find ways to strengthen your faith. And it is necessary to do so, in my judgment. There is a-it is called a walk. It is not called a moment or a respite ; it is a walk. It is a constant maturing of an understanding of a-and [DATE]'s ceremony, I bet you, for [CARDINAL] of people was a reaffirmation for many and a way to make sure doubts do not seep into your soul. Pope [PERSON] Successor [INTERVIEWER]. Given that, how difficult do you think that it will be finding a successor to fill his shoes? [INTERVIEWED]. Look, I am interested in working with whoever the successor is. And I think that, as Cardinal [PERSON] said at the ceremony on [DATE], [DATE] His Holiness died, asked for prayers as he began his journey as [CARDINAL] of the electors, as a Cardinal. You know, I am not going to prejudge the selection process. [INTERVIEWER]. Are there any qualities that you are specifically looking for? [INTERVIEWED]. I am not a part of the selection process. I will be a [INTERVIEWED] representing a great nation in dealing with a great institution with which we have diplomatic relations. [INTERVIEWER]. It is got to be a tough act to follow, though. [INTERVIEWED]'s Meeting With [NORP] Prime Minister [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. Can you tell us a little bit about your dinner with Prime Minister [PERSON]? Did you talk, particularly, on [GPE]? Did the subject come up, in terms of the intelligence officer who was killed by [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it did come up, and I expressed my regret once again and assured him that the investigation would be conducted in an aboveboard, transparent way. [INTERVIEWER]. Did he say it had been a problem for him in keeping the support that there is in [GPE] for having troops in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No, he reaffirmed his commitment to-which he has given in the past-that we have got to make sure we complete the mission, that we help [NORP] to fight off the few. He knows what I know, that the sooner that gets done, the sooner our troops will be able to come home. But he is also aware that what we do not want to do is leave prematurely, so that we do not complete our job. And the new Government is just about to be stood up; we look forward to working with the new [ORG] on a lot of things and a lot of fronts. But on the security front, it is to make sure we are in sync with our training schedules, make sure that the chain of command within the military and between the civilian government and the military are strong and capable and will endure. We have been waiting for this new Government so that we can then strategize. And as soon as the Government is sworn in, the appropriate folks, we can get [PERSON] confirmed quickly, get him out there-of course, we have a good, strong Deputy Chief of Mission there now, upon swearing in-of course, I will be in contact with the Prime Minister. I have already spoke to [INTERVIEWED]. And General [PERSON], as well as the Charge-I mean, the Deputy Chief of Mission will be in touch with; [PERSON] will be touch with her counterpart; Secretary [PERSON] will be in touch with his counterpart as we strategize as to how to move forward. As we strategize on tactics, on how to implement the strategy-which is clear- which is, we want to train you and make you as efficient as possible as quickly as possible, so that all of us can begin to, you know, as I say, bring our troops home with the honor they have earned. [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE] is going to pull out [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] troops, I think, by [DATE]. Will you be able to absorb that? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not know why you say that. I am not sure why you said what you just said. [INTERVIEWER]. I thought that was the number of troops [GPE] had in [GPE], and I-- [INTERVIEWED]. They have got [CARDINAL] now, and you said they are going to pull [CARDINAL] 000 out by [DATE]? [INTERVIEWER]. Well, I guess-I do not -- [INTERVIEWED]. Okay. What I did hear was, is that the Prime Minister wants to work to make sure we complete the mission. But I am not sure where that came from. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think he will leave troops in if, in fact, enough have not been trained? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we will work to complete the training mission of the [NORP]. And it is important we do it and get it right. The amazing thing is, is that if you really think about what is happened in the [DATE] period, in spite of [DATE] and in spite of some tragedy, loss of life, this country is-there is a democracy emerging in this country. And it was really kicked off by the huge vote of [CARDINAL] people. But no, we will work with all our coalition, continue to make sure we stay in touch with all our-I had breakfast with [PERSON] [TIME], speaking about coalition. You know, I stay in regular contact with the Prime Minister. Representative [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. Can I ask you about [PERSON], the statement he made in the wake of the [PERSON] case, that judges were out of control and should be held accountable. What did you think about those? [INTERVIEWED]. I believe in an independent judiciary. I believe in proper checks and balances. And we will continue to put judges on the bench who strictly and faithfully interpret the Constitution. Foreign and Domestic Priorities/Social Security Reform [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I know you are not- you have said-you have often said you are not consumed by polls, but a fair amount has been written lately about your approval ratings, which in some polls are at sort of a low point. Some polls-- [INTERVIEWED]. Some of them were going up [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER]. Okay. Well, some say that-- [INTERVIEWED]. You can find them going up, and you can find them going down. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. In general, what-- [INTERVIEWED]. You can pretty much find out what you want in polls, is my point. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWER]. What about the theory that your Presidency is moving from one dominated by foreign policy to one of domestic policy? Ironically, now that some of things are settling down in [GPE] and [GPE] and you are facing tough issues like [ORG], it is a little tougher road to hoe. What are your thoughts? [INTERVIEWED]. My thoughts are the [INTERVIEWED] has always got to balance foreign policy and domestic policy, and I will- I did so in the first term. As you might remember, we were confronted with a recession, and I felt we needed to reform schools, and at the same time, I had to fight the war on terror. We are continuing to fight the war on terror. The war on terror goes on, and that is the important thing for me to continue to remind our fellow citizens. By the way, we will work to defeat the enemy by, you know, making sure our troops are well framed up, prepared, ready to move quickly. It is part of the transformation process that the Secretary is leading. And to make sure our intelligence services mesh and work closely together, I am looking forward to getting [PERSON] confirmed as quickly as possible, so we can deal with this crucial aspect. But there is also, obviously, a domestic component. There was a domestic component in the first term. There is a domestic component in the second term. I might remind you that at points during the tax debate, I can remember people had declared that tax relief was dead on arrival. Occasionally, somebody would say something that was not very positive about the process, and people would all of a sudden assume that nothing was going to get done. So I am accustomed to, you know, the process of getting a piece of legislation out. And I am very optimistic that when it is all said and done, the legislators will understand that the [NORP] people recognize there is a problem in [ORG] and expect something to be done. And I look forward to being a part of that. I had laid out a timetable to make it clear to the [NORP] people my views about the problems inherent in [ORG]. And I think we are making progress. I think slowly but surely, the [NORP] people are coming to realize there is a serious problem with [ORG]-not if you have retired. And that is the other aspect of making sure we succeed in the [ORG] debate, is to make sure seniors know they are going to get their checks. And we have got work to do on that. [INTERVIEWER]. Still think it will pass [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I certainly hope so, because now is the time to fix the problem. Every year we wait costs [MONEY] more. And I fully realize some people would rather me not be discussing this issue. The job of the [INTERVIEWED] is to set an agenda that deals with problems. And sometimes-sometimes the legislature does not want to deal with the problem. But I am going to continue to remind all of us in Government that when we see a problem, we have an obligation to do something about it, no matter what some may think are the short-term political consequences. I happen to believe that not dealing with the problem will create political consequences when the public realizes how serious the problem is. If you do not deal with the problem or you go home and say, I am not dealing with the problem, there will be a political consequence. I have learned that lesson, as a Governor and [INTERVIEWED], that the people expect and respect people for setting agenda items and staying focused on achieving a solution to the problem. And I have set an agenda. I set an agenda on energy. We need an energy bill. You know, we have been talking about energy for [DATE]. Now, I fully realize an energy bill reflects a longer-term strategy. But we need to-we need to do a lot of things. Eventually what we are going to have to do is change our habits, change the types of automobiles we drive. I believe we will have a [CARDINAL]-emission coal-fired electricity plant. I saw the-when we went to [GPE]-or [GPE], we saw the technology involved with that. But [ORG] needs to get me an energy bill. And it seems like to me, with the price of gasoline where it is, that ought to be enough this time to cause people to get moving on the bill. But I will continue to push it. We need to get a budget. We passed- I put a pretty good budget, a real good budget. It helps cut the budget in half- the deficit in [CARDINAL] over a [DATE] period of time. Now they need to get their differences worked out and get it to my desk. I will be a part of that process as well. And then, eventually, we are going to have this tax relief commission come forward. In other words, I have an obligation to set agenda items. And when I set one, I will continue to work it and remind people that we have a duty to deal with these problems. I like the debate, by the way, as an aside. I am enjoying this. I am enjoying-- [INTERVIEWER]. Even if a lot of-- [INTERVIEWED]. --because I feel I got elected for a reason. My nature is such that, if I came to [GPE] and saw a problem and did not deal with it, I would not feel very good about myself. I want it to be said that [PERSON] got elected and did what he said he was going to do, for starters. You covered my campaigns. Every speech, I talked about [ORG]. And I started talking about [ORG] in [DATE], because I recognized a problem coming down the road. And it is a serious problem, particularly if you are a younger [NORP]. You have no problem if you are receiving a [ORG] check. I do not care-and I am going to say it like you have heard me say it-it does not matter what the propagandists say, people are going to get their checks. You might remember the ads that they ran against me when I was running for office that said, If [PERSON] elected, you are not going to get your check. I am sure you guys analyzed those and realized that upon election, people got their checks, which might say something about those who ran the ads, right? Well, they are saying it again. They are trying to frighten seniors in order to stop people from coming together. Now, in [DATE], something that has lost a little bit of the focus of those covering this issue, I called together [ORG], and I think it might be wise for people who analyze this issue to refresh their memory about [ORG], because [ORG], made up of equally [NORP] and [NORP], came up with some interesting ideas to solve this problem. [INTERVIEWER]. How deeply have you had to draw down on that political credit that you felt you had? [INTERVIEWED]. I think you get-I think you earn capital, you know? I think-- [INTERVIEWER]. Are you spending any? [INTERVIEWED]. I am spending a lot-every time I go out. [Laughter] But you earn capital by spending capital; that is what the people expect. We have got trips-I will be keeping-going out, reminding people that there is a problem. And one of these days, we will be able to look back and say, You know, we were successful convincing the [NORP] people there was a problem, and we were successful reminding seniors that you are not going to have your check taken away from you. And then all of a sudden, it becomes a true generational issue, because the grandparents receiving the checks, they are going to start asking, Now that I am secure, what are you going to do for my grandkid, because the grandchildren are going to pay an enormous price. You heard those experts sit up there and say that if nothing happens it is likely younger workers are going to have to pay an [PERCENT]percent payroll tax. Now, I was born prior to [DATE]. But if I were my daughter hearing somebody predict that at some point in time she is paying an [PERCENT]percent payroll tax, I'd be suggesting to the old man-me-that I get something done. And that is what we are doing. We are working hard to get it done. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you surprised that it is taken this much work, this long-- [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. --to make progress on this, because, you know-- [INTERVIEWED]. No. And this is a difficult issue. I have heard Members say-I am not going to tell you who they are nor what party they are from; I wish you had not have brought this up. We hear the talk out of [ORG] saying, Oh, darn, I wish the [INTERVIEWED] had just focused only on the budget or maybe the energy bill. There are a lot of people who would rather not talk about this issue. I understand that. Again, I do not think that is part of my job description, avoid issues because it may be politically difficult. I think my job description is, if you see a problem, talk about it and work with members of both political parties to come up with a solution. And there is beginning to be some talk on [ORG]. But I am not the least bit surprised, because it is a tough issue for Members, for people who've got, you know, a relatively short-term horizon, [DATE] horizon. They are worried about-some of them are worried about elections. Some of them in both the [ORG] and the [ORG]-from both parties, by the way-are thinking longer term. And they are beginning to talk some ideas, and that is constructive. You know, I remember I was telling [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], I remember watching [CARDINAL] of his townhall meetings in [GPE], [GPE], on this very subject. And I thought it was a very impressive presentation. By the way, a lot of the language happens to be pretty close to some of the townhall meetings we have had. But, no, I am not surprised people want to avoid this issue. Travel With Former [INTERVIEWED]s [PERSON] and [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. What has it been like spending time with the former [INTERVIEWED]s for [DATE]? That is the longest time-- [INTERVIEWED]. It is fun. Oh, it is great. You know, we share war stories, you know, a lot of talking, a lot of interesting experiences about different world leaders that we may all have met-or all [CARDINAL] of us met, just different experiences that, you know, my dad might have had or [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] might have had. There is a lot of interest, obviously, with former [INTERVIEWED]s about, you know, policy, so I had them sit in on our policy briefings [TIME] with [PERSON] and [PERSON] and the [ORG] fellow traveling with us-not [TIME], [DATE] and [DATE], on Air Force One. And then [DATE] at the [FAC], I wanted to include them in. And you know, we had a-these [ORG] briefings a lot of time prompt policy discussions, you know, how is this process going. [PERSON] and [PERSON], now that she is here-both of them were able to bring [PERSON] and [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] up to date on our strategy in dealing with a particular issue. It is interesting to get their points of view about their experiences in particular countries. It was fun. It was really a lot of fun. I was honored they came. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you worried about them spending so much time together, those [CARDINAL]? [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. Well, you heard my gridiron speech. [Laughter] Listen, thank you all. Hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. Absolutely fascinating. By the way, I think when you discuss religion-on doubt, there is no doubt in my mind there is a living God and no doubt in my mind that the Lord, [PERSON], was sent by the Almighty. No doubt in my mind about that. When I am talking about doubts, I am talking about the doubts that an individual struggles with in his or her life. That is important for you to make sure you get that part of the dialog correct, if you do not mind. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED]. Got it? Everybody got it correct? All right. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [DATE] Plans [INTERVIEWER]. What are your plans [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Like [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], I am on the injured reserve list from running, so I will be mountain biking. I think [PERSON] is going come up from [GPE]. Oh, yes. And I will be fishing. I will be finishing my book, Peter the Great, by [PERSON]. Some of you old-timers have probably already read it. I am just now-have you read it? [INTERVIEWER]. Getting ready for the next [GPE] trip. [INTERVIEWED]. Have you read it? [INTERVIEWER]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. I like when you said old-timer, and you looked at [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. He probably had read it, and I was not going to look at [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], of course, I am too polite. [Laughter] We will have briefings. [PERSON] is coming to spend [TIME]; [PERSON] will be spending [TIME] there. We will start briefing the [PERSON] visit [DATE] [TIME]. And then we will obviously greet the Prime Minister and then head off to [FAC] on [DATE] [TIME] and work on that speech probably [DATE] [TIME]. Looking forward to getting back down there again. I may do a little cedar work- depends on how sleepy the crew is. [INTERVIEWER]. I will be fishing, just down the Bosque River. [INTERVIEWED]. Really? [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. I am sleeping at [FAC] [TIME]. [INTERVIEWED]. Tell them hi. Middle Fork has got some water in it. [INTERVIEWER]. They do. [INTERVIEWED]. The Middle Fork comes down to my place. [INTERVIEWER]. Does it come down to you from his, or goes the other way? [INTERVIEWED]. I think it comes down, does not it? Yes, I think he is west of me, so it is coming down toward [GPE]. The Middle Fork feeds into the Brazos. Consider yourself lucky you get to go down to [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. I am delighted. [INTERVIEWED]. You are not grousing about it, are you? [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, no, no, no. I am sorry I missed [DATE]. I was at home for that. [INTERVIEWED]. It may be-I hope-I have not heard, but it may be that the wildflowers, are they out yet? They say there is going to be a spectacular bluebonnet season [DATE]; I mean spectacular. [DATE] [ORG] Women's Basketball Champions [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Is that in honor of the [ORG] women's basketball team? [INTERVIEWED]. I called, as a matter of fact, on the airplane flying to [GPE], I called the coach, [PERSON], a fine person. I had met her before when she brought-you all saw her, at least if you were on the pool, right? Let us see- anyway, she was with the [ORG] girls softball team when they came out, the national champs softball team. Her daughter is a player on it, and so she came out with the parents. But she was [CARDINAL] excited lady. And she did a heck of a job. [INTERVIEWER]. Blew them out. [INTERVIEWED]. They have got a great team. I am looking forward to welcoming them to [ORG].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone2", "text": "[ORG] Press Secretary [PERSON]. So I thought the [INTERVIEWED] and Mrs. [PERSON] would spend a little bit of time with you, with their reflections, on the record. We do not have a lot of time, especially because [PERSON] [[ORG]] is not feeling well. [INTERVIEWED] I would say this is one of the most exciting trips of my Presidency. Exciting because when we first got to [GPE], Africa was-parts of Africa were in turmoil; not much had been to arrest disease; there was not intense world focus on the continent. The second trip to Africa for me-the fifth for [PERSON]-was a chance to herald courageous people in their efforts to deal with hopelessness. And what really made me happy was that the people of Africa have come to appreciate the generosity of the [NORP] people. I had a couple of goals. [CARDINAL] was to encourage people to continue to make difficult choices-democracy is hard work- but also assure them that we'd stay with them if they made the right choices. Secondly, I wanted to highlight for the [NORP] people what the-that great compassionate work is being done. And I will give you some-[PERSON] can share some anecdotes too. You know, in the hospital in [GPE], to see a [DATE] baby survive a mosquito bite when [DATE] probably would not have was a very compelling moment for me. To have the little orphans in [GPE] put on such a cheerless-a cheery face because somebody is trying to provide them love was inspiring to me. To watch their little guys play tee-ball-all of whom were orphans-against the little school and see how inspired they were. But also see the concern and care of their mentors and coaches was very inspiring to me. All of these programs are supported by the [NORP] taxpayer, and all of them matter. To hear the testimony of these kids and teachers in [GPE] about how our aid has helped them regain confidence-I do not know if you all were in there when the mother of [CARDINAL] talked about-her husband left her, she said, because she was illiterate, so he just left her with the [CARDINAL] kids. And she is a part of this adult literacy program that [ORG] is helping with. She talked about being able to read, fill out bank checks, her deposit slips, then announced she wanted to go to college, and then announced she wanted to take [PERSON] job. Anyway, it is the human condition that matters. You heard me say a lot on the trip that we are on a mission of mercy, and that is what I think we are. And I think it is in our national interest to do it. I know this: I know that when you volunteer as an individual to help somebody who hurts, it helps you. Well, I believe the same when it comes to collective hearts of [GPE]. So it is been a-it is an exciting trip. I mean, you saw the crowds, you saw the enthusiasm. But that is not what is important. You know, people say-[PERSON] asked me, he said: Why do not you take credit for it? Why do not you show what you have done for Africa? Well, it is not me, for starters. And you do not act out of the desire to enhance your own standing; that is not exactly why one is called into service. It does not matter about me. What matters is, are we saving people's lives? That is what matters. And we are. And so I am really pleased with it and had great meetings with the leaders. It seems like [DATE] that we went to [GPE]. But he is a good guy. He is enthusiastic. And of course, [PERSON] in [GPE] and [PERSON] in-look, the other thing about the [GPE] stop and the [GPE] stop is, these are societies that only recently have been ravished by unbelievable and unspeakable violence. And yet they are getting back on their feet. And it is hard work, and we will help them. That was what I told them. And these were [CARDINAL] very strong leaders that we visited with. Which leads me to conclude this-and [PERSON] can share some thoughts-[GPE] should not be dictating to these countries, [GPE] ought to be helping leaders make decisions. And that is what we are doing. And we go to Africa with a belief in the capacity of human beings to meet high standards. That is what I kept trying to say to you out there in code. We did not go guilt ridden. We go with a positive sense about the capacity of leaders to rise to the challenge and meet certain basic criteria, such as honest government, investing in children, investing in health, and understanding that marketplace economics and trade is more powerful than accepting relief from countries. Anyway-and how about the [NORP] troops? You talk about proud people. Wasn't it unbelievable? Yeah, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it was. Yes, [PERSON]. [At this point, the First Lady made brief remarks.] [INTERVIEWED] Okay, we will do a round-robin here. Yes, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]], you are the senior person. [NORP] View of the [DATE] [GPE] [INTERVIEWED]ial Election/[GPE] [INTERVIEWED]ial Primary [INTERVIEWER]. [CARDINAL] of the things that we heard from people-I guess they do consider [GPE] a democracy, a role model. What if [NORP] were elected [INTERVIEWED]? Did they talk to you-- [INTERVIEWED] That never came up. [INTERVIEWER]. It never came up? The First Lady. It never came up to us at all. They said they were very fascinated with the election, [CARDINAL] group that I talked to. [INTERVIEWED] I'd just like to remind you what [PERSON] said. He said, I hope the next [INTERVIEWED] is as good as this one. Now, I am not blowing my own horn--and I am sure it was a screaming headline. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you going to vote in the [GPE] primary? [INTERVIEWED] Yes, I am. [INTERVIEWER]. As a [NORP] or a [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED] I think I will be in the [NORP] primary [DATE]. No, but it never came up. It seemed like a good storyline at the time. Somebody must be putting something out there in the pool, and everybody starts chatting about it. [INTERVIEWER]. People would mention it to us. [INTERVIEWED] If you asked them, yes, What do you think about [PERSON]? Yes, they mentioned it to you all right. Yes. [INTERVIEWER]. I asked them-I went out on the street, and [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] people I asked about-you know, I'd say, Obama-- [INTERVIEWED] What? [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON]-they like-they volunteered, [CARDINAL] of them-- [INTERVIEWED] Really? The First Lady. What country? [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED] Look, my mind was not on [GPE] politics on this trip; it is just not. It is on yours, not mine. I am focused on conducting foreign policy. Look, I understand this is the way it is going to be. We will be having roundtables, and you are going to be fascinated on the latest thing on politics, and I am going to be fascinated on trying to lay the foundation for lasting foreign policy that will make a significant difference to [GPE]. I am not going to be frustrated about it-except every time. No. [INTERVIEWED]'s Legacy/U.S. Foreign Policy [INTERVIEWER]. A question on that-is this how, in the end, you would like this effort-or this kind of effort, if this not specific one- this is what your Presidency is ultimately about? [INTERVIEWED] We just have to let history be the judge. But we have been a very active-we have had a very active foreign policy, whether it be liberating people from tyranny in order to protect ourselves or liberating people from disease, we have been active and strong and bold. And we will let history judge the results. I would just tell you this, and you have heard me say it, and it is true: There is no such thing as short-term political history. I mean, short-term history of an administration-forget political -there is such thing as short-term political history because there is an end result, win or lose. There is no such thing as an accurate history of an administration until time has lapsed, unless you are doing little-bitty things. [The First Lady made further remarks.] [INTERVIEWED] The other thing about- one of the things I hope people, when they are able to take an objective look at an administration-which I am not sure is possible, if you happen to have been living at the time of the administration; maybe you can, I do not think so-is whether or not an administration makes decisions based upon certain fundamental principles from which it will not vary. And you have heard me say over and over again, freedom is universal, or to whom much is given, much is required. Those are fundamental principles on which one can have a foreign policy. And one of the great dangers for [GPE] is to become isolationist or protectionist. And the purpose of-on trips like this is to remind people of the need not to become isolationist. And so it is -I view this as-this was a trip that heralded results. But it was also a trip that gives us an opportunity to explain over and over again the foundations of the foreign policy of the [PERSON] administration. Yes, [PERSON]. How you feeling, man? I have asked you twice. You look like you are a little pale. Intelligence Reform Legislation [INTERVIEWER]. I am hanging in there. [INTERVIEWED] Have you vomited yet [DATE]? [INTERVIEWER]. That is off the record. [INTERVIEWER]. No, that is on the record. [INTERVIEWER]. I see a big microphone. I'd like to ask you about an issue they are raising back home, and it is not the [DATE] campaign. [INTERVIEWED] Okay. [INTERVIEWER]. On FISA, I understand your position, but what I am unclear about is whether you are doing something to break the deadlock. Do you see yourself engaging with the other side, compromising? Or where do we go from here? [INTERVIEWED] How do you compromise on something like granting liability for a telecommunications company? You cannot . If we do not give liability protection to those who are helping us, they will not help us. And if they do not help us, there will be no program. And if there is no program, [GPE] is more vulnerable. What I am going to do is continue to remind people that unless they get this program done, we are going to be vulnerable to attack. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you see an opportunity to work with the [NORP] and-- [INTERVIEWED] I mean, there may be one, I do not know. But I will just tell you, there is no compromise on whether or not these phone companies get liability protection. See, what the [NORP] people must understand is that without help from the phone companies, there is no program. And these companies are going to be subject to [MONEY] lawsuits by trial lawyers, plaintiffs' attorneys. And it is going to drive them away from helping us, unless they get liability protection, prospective and retroactive. It is just so important for people to understand the dangers. If we do not have the capacity to listen to these terrorists, we are not going to be able to protect ourselves. [ORG] Press Secretary [PERSON]. Just a reminder that they have the votes to pass it in the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED] They have got enough votes to pass the bill in the [ORG]. So yes, I am going to talk about it a lot and keep reminding the [NORP]-I am glad you asked the question, because this will give everybody a chance to know the dangers of the course that some in the [ORG] have put us on. And I will keep talking about it. You know what? The [NORP] people understand that we need to be listening to the enemy. Situation in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Back to Africa, on [GPE]-on [GPE], I am trying to understand-- [INTERVIEWED] [GPE]? [INTERVIEWER]. [GPE], yes. [INTERVIEWED] That is why you have got the Secretary sitting here. [INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. I mean, are you going to send her back? Where are we? What is next? And how realistic is it-I still do not understand how anyone is really thinking that the Government, which has been so stubborn, is actually going to-- [INTERVIEWED] --the opposition. [INTERVIEWER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED] That is the dilemma; how you get [CARDINAL] people to sit down at a table and work on what is best for Africa-I mean, for [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER]. But realistically, how do you? I mean, are you going to-- [INTERVIEWED] She was in the room with them. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you going to go back? [INTERVIEWED] We got [PERSON], who is plenty competent. [Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] made brief remarks.] [INTERVIEWED] I was going to say that, you know, the most effective way to get these issues resolved is for these leaders to feel pressure from their own people. And it is [CARDINAL] thing for [PERSON] and [PERSON] and people making phone calls, but [GPE] is a society; it is got a-for example, [GPE] is the economic engine for East Africa. I do not know if you saw all those ships in [GPE]. Those were originally- many of them were originally headed for [GPE], interestingly enough. And I suspect these leaders are beginning to feel a lot of pressure internal. Secondly, they are actually hearing from [NORP] leaders about the dangers of allowing these kind of conflicts to not be nipped in the bud early, to be prevented from happening. And we will help. We sent people over, and we will stay engaged. It is really up to the [NORP] society itself and the leaders there to get their leaders with them. [INTERVIEWER]. Does not it seem to be that they are pressuring with violence? [INTERVIEWED] With what? [INTERVIEWER]. The way that they are pressuring, it seems to be with violence. [INTERVIEWED] No, no, no, you are missing it. There is a civil society in [GPE]. You are talking about some of the splinter groups on some of the parties. There is a civil society, and it is a relatively sophisticated civil society that is exerting pressure, that is not resorting to violence. Secretary [PERSON]. The [NORP] press is very tough on these leaders to resolve this- [inaudible]-civil society-[inaudible]- people who are pressing for peaceful change and saying, you cannot let our society collapse into anarchy. Return Trip From Africa [INTERVIEWED] I get to ask a question. Will you be taking a nap on the way back? [INTERVIEWER]. I did not sleep [CARDINAL] wink [TIME], but if I sleep on the flight home, I will not sleep when I get home, and I have to be at the office at [TIME] [INTERVIEWED] You are going to go around the clock? [INTERVIEWER]. Well, I might try. [INTERVIEWED] I am actually promoting- I have obviously got a nap on my mind. I was just trying to, like, plant the seed. Yes, [PERSON] [[PERSON], [ORG]]. [GPE] View of the [INTERVIEWED]'s Visit to Africa [INTERVIEWER]. I want to go back to Africa. You talked about [NORP] and their generosity-- [INTERVIEWED] What is that? [INTERVIEWER]. [NORP] and their generosity-what do you think that [NORP] think of your trip? [INTERVIEWED] I do not have any idea. What are you writing about it? I do not know what they think of it. Ask another question. I really do not know. I am focused on the trip. When I get home, I pick up a book and start reading it, and I am sound asleep shortly thereafter. So I am not-I do not know. I really do not know. The First Lady. Depends on what you all are showing. [INTERVIEWED] I do not know. I hope they think-here is what I hope they think: It is worthwhile to be supportive of a robust policy on the continent of Africa. It is worth our national security interest, and it is worth our interest to help people learn to read and write and save babies' lives from mosquito bites. That is what I hope they realize, and that is one of the main-that is a critical reason to go on the trip. I would hope that the country never says, well, it is not worth it over there, what happens over there-or it says, well, we have got to take care of our own first, exclusively. And my answer is, we can do both. We are a generous country. And we do, do both. [ORG] [INTERVIEWER]. Do you have everything in place so that the next [INTERVIEWED], who might not look at Africa in [DATE]-everything is in place to continue? [INTERVIEWED] --you know, getting this funding from [ORG]. And I think we will. The [ORG] program has been great. It is a bipartisan success. [ORG] funded the thing-not the thing, [ORG] funded the program, and they ought to take great pride in the success of [ORG]. There is a process that goes on to get it reauthorized, and we will try to get it funded, and will get it funded. I feel pretty good about getting it funded. Same with the malaria initiative: It is making a huge difference, and the success is unbelievable. In [GPE], [PERCENT] of the kids were infected, had gotten malaria. Now it is [PERCENT]percent], * in a pretty quick period of time. Okay, guys.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersdomesticandforeignpolicyissues", "text": "[ORG]'s Accomplishments in [DATE] [INTERVIEWER]. Looking back over [DATE], what do you think you did wrong, and what would you have done differently? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think there are always things that you will think you did wrong. But I think, basically, we have continued on the path that we set in [DATE]. The progress that we have made economically is apparent. It is the first time in [DATE] that we have had a recovery from a recession in which not only is industrial-well, let us say just productivity-increasing, personal earnings increasing, inflation and unemployment both going down-all of these things happening at the same time. This has not happened in a recovery for [DATE], which makes me believe we are on a firm footing and have laid a foundation for a solid recovery. That part is won. There are things-if you say what should we have done differently?-well, there are things. In trying to negotiate bipartisan agreements on some of these, you look back and think, well, maybe if we'd worked harder in one direction or another we might have gotten more cooperation in our need to reduce government spending. On the international scene, I think that our continued buildup of our strength has changed international relations a great deal. I do not think without that we would have had the beginning negotiations that we have had with regard to reduction of nuclear weapons, both the INF and the START talks. I think it is due to that. I think we have got a finer relationship than we have had for a long time with our own friends and allies. This is particularly true in the efforts that we have made in Asia, as well as our longtime friends in Europe. So, all in all, I think that there has been progress. But it is a foundation laid for more progress. [INTERVIEWER]. If I could just-but surely-was there anything you went back at the end of the day and said, Oh, darn, I really -you know- that did not work right, we should have done it. Is there any one thing that you can pick out? [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, well, I probably could get incensed about-but this was before [DATE], earlier than that-going for the tax bill on the assumption that we'd been promised [MONEY] in reductions in spending for every dollar of tax revenue, and we have never seen the $[MONEY] in reduced spending. The Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], do you think the new rapprochement between [PERSON] and [PERSON] now opens the way as a breakthrough for the possibility of your peace plan getting moving and [PERSON] taking part? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, [PERSON], I am always a little leery about saying a breakthrough, but I do think this: We are optimistic about this because if you look at the relationship there and the [CARDINAL] countries-or the [CARDINAL] peoples that were involved, [PERSON] is the head of state of the [CARDINAL] country in the [NORP] world that has gone forward and has a peace treaty with [GPE]. We are hopeful that the peace process will bring about more [NORP] nations making their peace with [GPE]. Obviously, a part of that process depends on a fair and just settlement of the [NORP] question. And [PERSON] has, in the past, has been one who has refused to recognize [GPE]'s right to exist as a nation. But the fact that earlier, and before this split in the [ORG] ranks, he had begun to discuss with King [PERSON] negotiations and participating in those negotiations on behalf of the [NORP]-then that broke down with the split in the [NORP] movement. Now I think that what [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] is doing is talking to him about returning to where he was earlier, making contact with King [PERSON], and getting those peace negotiations, our peace proposal, underway again. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think there is a good chance? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I do. I really do, because we had believed that a settlement in [GPE] had to precede going further with that. I do not think that is necessarily true now. I think enough progress has been made there that we can go forward with the peace movement. [INTERVIEWER]. May I follow up, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? [GPE] has denounced the talks between [PERSON] and [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], saying it was a pure violation of the Camp David agreements. Would you respond to that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I do not think it was a violation. I can understand their feelings in view of the recent tragedy in [GPE], and the group taking credit for that claimed to be a [ORG] group and all. But at the same time, I think as they look at this a little more clearly, they will see that [PERSON], based on the experience of [GPE] and its willingness to go forward for peace, is simply trying to persuade others to change their thinking. There was [CARDINAL] point not too long before the peace treaty with [GPE], in which [GPE] was as violent in its hostility as perhaps [DATE] the elements of the [ORG] are. So, who is better able to try and bring in another person into the peace process than someone who has made the change that [GPE] has made? [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think Mr. [PERSON] is still a popular leader among the [NORP] themselves? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, this is what we need to find out. I cannot believe that that radical group that, under the influence of the [NORP], created all this tragedy around [GPE] and the innocent people that were killed because of the violence of that battle-I cannot believe that [CARDINAL] of [NORP] are going to choose that leadership. [GPE] and Arms Negotiations [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], on a slightly different subject, you mentioned that due to our arms buildup, that brought the [NORP] to the negotiating table. And now we have had a breakdown in the arms talks, and there seems to be an increased level of tension. Do you think we are at a confrontation state with the [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. And what do you see as the chance of an arms accord in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we are going to keep on with that. And, actually, the [NORP] have not said no. They said they would not set a date yet for the resumption of these talks. [INTERVIEWER]. On INF they just walked out. [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER]. On the INF talks they just walked out. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but since then there have been statements to the fact that they just are not ready and that they are unwilling at this point to set a date. I believe they will be back, and I believe we are further from a confrontation possibility because of the deterrent capability of [GPE] and our allies at this point. I think there was a far more unstable condition when we had let our own strength deteriorate to the point that there was a window of vulnerability. And I would like to call your attention to [CARDINAL] thing. There have been [CARDINAL]-prior to this, to our talks-there have been [CARDINAL] efforts since World War II to engage [GPE] in talks about arms reduction. There has never been any progress made in those. The SALT talks, actually, were not arms reductions; they were supposed to be setting a ceiling on how many more weapons would be built. And that has not been ratified, the SALT II treaty. But in these negotiations, even though the [NORP] were not as forthcoming as we would like to have had them be, they still did make a couple of offers to reduce the number of their weapons. Now, that is the first time they have ever done that in any negotiations, in all these previous [CARDINAL] attempts. And I think that now that they see that we are determined to maintain our own ability to defend ourselves, and our allies with us are included in that, I think that they have to see that these negotiations are in their interest as well as ours. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you have any signals that they are actually planning to come back? Or are you just looking at it from your-what you see as common sense? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I think the things that we have heard. I think that this is, you might say, almost a part of the negotiating process. Their whole principal move over [DATE] or so has been an effort to stop the deployment of the intermediate-range weapons that were asked for by [ORG]. And the fact that we are going ahead, this, maybe, could be tied to that as still, you might say, an element of negotiating. But we are going to proceed with the installation of those weapons. [INTERVIEWER]. And you do not think it is [TIME], the doomsday clock? The scientists seem to think so. [INTERVIEWED]. Well.- [INTERVIEWER]. And they think it is a more dangerous world now. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, maybe the scientists know more about science. And from the standpoint of the power of the weapons, yes, they are more powerful; they are more destructive on both sides than they were before. And maybe looking at it from a scientist's viewpoint, that moves up their doomsday clock. But they are not involved in the diplomatic and political end of this as we are. [INTERVIEWER]. But, sir, you only have [TIME] now to make a decision on war and peace according to the nuclear scientists. There would be [TIME] on each side. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, now, [PERSON], in the Bible were not we told that a long period of time was only a moment or even [TIME] to God? I do not know what [TIME] refers to. I know it does not refer to [TIME] [INTERVIEWER]. You think it would be a lot longer for you to decide? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am wondering. On their doomsday clock, [TIME] on that clock-is that [DATE]? Is that [DATE]? Is that [DATE]? They have never said what it is. But, no, I believe that actually-and I can understand their feeling-all that they hear and, forgive me, but a lot of the editorial content is that, Oh, there are great tensions. There has been, let us say, more heat in rhetoric. There has not been more heat in the actual relationship. At the time that the rhetoric was being used from both sides, our negotiators were sitting there at the table negotiating. [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], can I come back on the prospects of these talks, these arms talks? There is a lot of concern, especially in Europe, that with the lack of dialog between West and the East, especially as the [GPE] is entering [DATE]-if you run for reelection-that the [NORP] are not likely to help you. How do you see the prospects for some kind of an agreement before the elections? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would hope that [GPE] would remember their failure in trying to influence the [NORP] election and decide not to go down that road again. But as far as I am concerned, whoever our candidate may be, I do not think any decisions on a subject of this kind should be made on our part, on our side, on the basis of-as I said the other night-political considerations. We are going to continue to do everything we can to resume and achieve arms reductions, as sizable as we can make them, and ultimately I would hope total elimination of nuclear weapons. They have no real place in a civilized world. The goal is peace. And I have been a little disturbed by the tendency of so many in this country who seem to feel that somehow we are at fault, when they are the ones who left the table without setting a date for return. [INTERVIEWER]. So, you are not going to make any proposal before- [INTERVIEWED]. Oh, we are in communication. We have not broken off communications. We are not, as we have been portrayed, that the [CARDINAL] superpowers are here separated with no contact at all. No, we are in communication with them. And we want to continue these policies that would lead toward reduction of arms and that would lead toward peace. I am prepared to say if [ORG] wants peace, there will be no war, because I know for a fact that no other country wants war with [GPE]. The ball is really in their court. If they want peace, they can have it. [INTERVIEWER]. And is not that, though, what is kept the peace, this mutual terror? [INTERVIEWED]. I think the deterrent capability, yes. See, we have a weapon here in the world [DATE], the nuclear weapon, that for the first time in the history of all man's weapons has never resulted in a defensive weapon being created against it. The only thing we have is deterrence. The only thing we have is the knowledge that on both sides the punishment would be more than any nation could afford. If they started it, they would have to be prepared to accept virtually as much punishment as they were administering. And this has kept the peace. I have had some meetings with young people who brought this very subject up, and they are greatly concerned. And I have asked them a question, and I must say they come up with a pretty sound answer. I have said, We are the only ones that have ever used a nuclear weapon-in [GPE] in World War II. Would we have used that weapon if we knew they also had that weapon and could use it back against us? And without fail, every group I have ever said this to has decided that, no, we would never have used the weapon. [INTERVIEWER]. So, that is the real deterrent to war. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, yes. Central America [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in Central America recently there have been some apparently conciliatory gestures from [GPE]. Do you think these are sincere moves, or are they propaganda ploys, and do you intend any response to them? [INTERVIEWED]. I think that there is more they can do than they have done. I think the situation with them right now is covered by the words of [PERSON] in the [NORP] marketplace [DATE] when he said, What man would let another man's words, rather then his deeds, tell him who is at peace and who is at war with him? [INTERVIEWER]. So, you do not think too much of these gestures then? [INTERVIEWED]. No, we have made it plain. There, again, there is been contact. And Ambassador [PERSON] has made it plain to them that all they have to do is reinstitute the principles of their own revolution-the things that they promised the people they were going to bring about if their revolution succeeded. And they have not done that. They betrayed their own revolution and created a totalitarian state. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, if you turn Demosthenes around, might the people in [GPE] not say, We want to see some deeds from [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, what hostile deeds have they seen? [INTERVIEWER]. Well, they think of [GPE], for one. Maybe we think-maybe you think it was a very benign.- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think [INTERVIEWER]. Rebel forces preparing to invade- [INTERVIEWED]. But those rebel forces are part of their own original revolution-the people that, once they succeeded, were ousted because they wanted to institute the democratic policies. [INTERVIEWER]. But they are being armed by us. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we set out after the revolution succeeded-and prior to my administration, the previous administration immediately started to come to the financial aid, economic aid, to the [NORP] government until it found out that the [NORP] government was not keeping the promise of its revolution. And the aid was withdrawn. Now, to invoke [GPE], here again I think the words of the [NORP] people themselves, the Governor General, the people of [GPE], our own people who were there and were rescued have revealed this was not an invasion. This was something in the nature of a commando operation, and it was a rescue mission. And the people of [GPE] have made it very plain that they feel they, too, were rescued. And the fact that we have withdrawn our combat troops so precipitously, that some of the [NORP] are a little alarmed-that they do not think we should have left yet. [ORG] Report on [ORG] Security in [GPE] [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], have you seen the [ORG] report yet, or do you know anything about it? It is so critical of [INTERVIEWED]. It has finally been delivered over here. It has not reached me as yet. [INTERVIEWER]. Right. You have not been briefed - [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. -- at all on it? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [INTERVIEWER]. It sounds devastating. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am not going to comment until I see it. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you have any-you do not really have any idea what is in it? [INTERVIEWED]. No more than I read in the papers. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think that a lot of people are going to suffer from it? [INTERVIEWED]. I just-[PERSON], I just cannot comment until I see it. [INTERVIEWER]. We have all heard that it in some way criticizes everyone in the chain of command. Do you philosophically, or in any way, feel that that chain of command is-you are at the top of it in this case-and you bear some of that responsibility? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, there is no way to discount responsibility. As Commander in Chief, the operation could not have gone forward without my approval. And so, in that sense, I think the investigation was being very thorough. Yes, there would have been no mission without my decision to go forward with it. The Middle East [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in [GPE], [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] of [GPE] [DATE] called for a withdrawal of the [NORP] contingent of the multinational force. Apparently there have been [CARDINAL] countries who were asked to join that force and who have refused. Are you not concerned that [GPE], by siding with [GPE], is going to end up alone in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I think that there was a not completely thorough statement of our meeting with Prime Minister [PERSON]. It was portrayed, and many people saw it, as somehow arriving at some new coalition with them, and even the word conspiracy was used by some in there. But, no, there was a reaffirmation by us of what our relationship with [GPE] has been since [DATE]. And we discussed this not from any standpoint of [GPE] and its relationship with [NORP] countries, in the sense of taking their part in anything of that kind. We are dedicated to the idea of trying, if we can, to act as a friend to both [GPE] and [GPE] in settling those longtime disputes and bringing about the kind of peace that we find between [GPE] and [GPE] now. [INTERVIEWER]. Do you think a [ORG] force would be better in there? [INTERVIEWED]. I would have wished from the very first for a [ORG] force. But what has prevented it? The [GPE] veto. If you look at the [ORG] [[ORG]] force that is presently in the south of [GPE], it is so bound by restrictions that were imposed in order to get the [GPE] vote that it literally is helpless to do anything. It is not that these people are ineffective or that they are not capable, they are restricted. [INTERVIEWER]. So then they could not possibly be replaced? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I could still hope that [GPE] now would recognize the value of having a [ORG] force in there. And as I say, we would have preferred this from the very first, but it was something that could not be obtained. Where was I on- [INTERVIEWER]. I was asking, are not you concerned of the growing reluctance of your allies to assume part of the burden in [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have been in communication. And I think that they understand better now, because we were just as forthright in talking to Prime Minister [PERSON] about our intentions in our dealings with [GPE] and the things that we were going to do in linkage with them. All of this aimed at being able-if a mediator can be of use in that peace process that we proposed-to ensure a fair solution to the problems. We have no plan that we are going to impose. That would be wrong of us to go in and say, Here is the peace plan. It must be negotiated out. On [CARDINAL] side there is territory, on the other side there could be assurances of security. And someplace there has to be a balance in there in which one is traded for the other. But that is up to them to negotiate. And I think our meeting with the Foreign Minister of [GPE], my own personal communication with [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON], other communications that we have made straightening out what the situation was and what our relationship with [GPE] is and what we want in a relationship with them. And I do not think-I think there was some discomfort at first; I do not think so any more. Mr. [PERSON]. 1 Excuse me. You have a [TIME] meeting. Make this the last question. [INTERVIEWER]. But is there any concern that [CARDINAL] other allied nations are asked to join this force and have backed out, or [CARDINAL] [PERSON], Assistant to [ORG] for Communications. [INTERVIEWED]. Ah, but you are going back. Remember when-I think this was back when we were putting it together, we were trying to get forces that would join in it. Well, now, there could be a number of reasons why a nation would not . There could be the very fact of cost to some nations. And remember, this recession has been worldwide. So, whatever their reasons were-but this was back when we were trying to put the multinational force together. And I think the very fact that [GPE], that [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] were able to provide what we thought was an adequate force for the purpose we had in mind- Ambassador [PERSON] [INTERVIEWER]. We have got [CARDINAL] true-and-false questions. Is [PERSON] leaving? [Laughter] Yes or no? [INTERVIEWED]. No. [PERSON] came in as she has [DATE]. Possibility of U.S.-Soviet Summit [INTERVIEWER]. Will you go for a summit? [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER]. Will you go for a summit if the [NORP] propose it? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have always been willing to go if there is a possibility of accomplishing something. Goals for [DATE] [INTERVIEWER]. And what do you want to happen [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I want the recovery to continue. I want us to achieve more control over spending. And therefore, I would hope that the press would reveal to the people of this country how valuable line-item- [INTERVIEWER]. Veto. [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED]. -line-item veto could be in the helping to get control over extravagance. [INTERVIEWER]. We will tell them. [INTERVIEWED]. And- [INTERVIEWER]. It will be in your budget proposal then? [INTERVIEWED]. And I would hope that we would be far more advanced toward peace and toward a reduction of nuclear weapons. [INTERVIEWER]. And a new tax? [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER]. A new tax? [INTERVIEWED]. I would hope that that would not be necessary. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersstlouis", "text": "[PERSON] [[ORG]]. Welcome to Newsmakers. I am [PERSON]. My guest [DATE] is the most consistent and most recognized newsmaker in the world. [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON] is in [GPE] to attend a White House Conference on Domestic and Economic Affairs. The conference is billed as a town meeting, a chance for the [INTERVIEWED] and the members of his [ORG] to exchange views with the citizens of [GPE]. Joining me in the questioning of [PERSON] [DATE] are [PERSON], chief [GPE] correspondent of [ORG], [PERSON], political editor of [ORG], and [PERSON], director of special events for [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED], welcome to [GPE], and thank you for making this your first stop. THE [INTERVIEWED]'S SAFETY [1.] [INTERVIEWER]. Our first question concerns a matter of major concern to the vast majority of [NORP]; that is, your personal safety. It is a frightening fact that a [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE] would have to wear a bulletproof vest, and we wonder whether this is going to become standard hardware, standard issue from [ORG] for future [NORP] [INTERVIEWED]s and yourself? We also wonder whether or not you feel that in the interest of national security, world security, you should modify your campaign style? [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], let me say at the outset I do not think I should discuss whether I wear or do not wear--or whether I do something or do not do something that involves the security. [ORG] makes recommendations. I feel an obligation to follow their recommendations. But to identify, [PERSON], what I am doing or why I am doing it, involving security, I think makes security that much more difficult. As to my desire to meet people when I come to either [GPE] or in [GPE], where I was [DATE], I feel it is important for the [NORP] people to have an opportunity to see firsthand, close-up, their [INTERVIEWED]. In any job, you know, there is a risk of some kind. I feel that you have to balance or weigh the risks as to my own personal security against what is a very important aspect of our political life in [GPE]. It is helpful for me to meet with the people, shake hands with them, get their questions, and it is just as important for them to have me say hello or to answer their questions. So, as I put the alternatives or the contending arguments on the scales, it seems to me that what is good for the country overbalances anything else. [INTERVIEWER]. We can see that your vest [DATE], that we can see, matches your suit and is quite attractive. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. THE [INTERVIEWED]'S SCHEDULE [2.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you seem to be doing more than just meeting the [NORP] people, though. You are actually campaigning at a breakneck speed, with the election still [DATE] away. You seem to be campaigning as if it is going to happen [DATE]. Why are you doing that? Are you afraid of [PERSON] as a possible rival? I'd like to ask you, also, if you think this is a wise use of your time when there are so many problems of government bearing on you? [INTERVIEWED]. I will answer the last question first. I work [TIME] [TIME] a day, and usually it is [TIME], and the odd times that I take out to come to [GPE], to [GPE], do not in any way whatsoever interfere with the conducting of [ORG] business by me as [INTERVIEWED]. I have an excellent staff. They prepare the options for me to make decisions. I have ample time to read and to study. So, when I come to [GPE], or [GPE], where I am going, or [GPE] [DATE], it in no way whatsoever interferes with the responsibilities I have, which are the highest, of being [INTERVIEWED] of [GPE]. Now, I do not consider coming to [GPE] a campaign effort. I did not go to [GPE] [DATE] for myself. I went there for the purpose of trying to elect a [NORP] candidate for [ORG] [ORG]. Governor [PERSON] had been there [TIME]. That was not for me, but for him or for our party's candidate. So, any personal campaigning has been minimal. The aim and objective of coming here is to appear on this program, to attend a White House Conference, to help [ORG] in [GPE] and [GPE]. I do not consider it a personal campaign effort. [3.] [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON] also asked you another question, and that is regarding [PERSON] and your possible fear of his candidacy. [INTERVIEWED]. [PERSON], I like competition in the political arena. Governor [PERSON] has not announced as a candidate yet. He has indicated either personally or through [CARDINAL] of this representatives that he may sometime in [DATE]. Governor [PERSON] was a fine Governor of the State of [GPE]. Until he announces his candidacy, I am assuming that I am the only [NORP] candidate, and I will welcome any competition. I love it. [4.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], with the seeming inability of government to solve the Nation's critical problems--oil, energy, the economy, growing [ORG] spending--and the seeming preoccupation with intelligence probes and pay raises and recesses, what can be done to restore confidence, believability, and credibility in government? [INTERVIEWED]. There are a number of things that I think can be helpful. There is not any [CARDINAL] thing that will answer the perplexing problem that you have posed. I happen to believe that a [INTERVIEWED] traveling around the country, meeting people, is one way. The alternative for a [INTERVIEWED] is to sit in seclusion in [FAC]. I do not think that adds to the credibility or improves or enhances the public impression of [GPE]. On the other hand, I think the [ORG], which is an integral part of our Government, [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] major branches, has an opportunity to also project itself and to improve its credibility by the work that it does, the answers that it gives, and its efforts to meet firsthand the [NORP] people. There are some substantive matters that have to be solved that would enhance the credibility of the [ORG] as such. We are making slow progress but, I think, constructive progress, out of the recession. Employment has gone up by [CARDINAL] in [DATE], even though the unemployment statistic is still too high. We are making headway in meeting the challenge of inflation. It is [CARDINAL] now what it was [DATE]. It is not good enough. We are going to have to do better. But as we move forward in meeting the challenge of our economy, that will enhance our Government's credibility with [CARDINAL] people. Also, energy must be solved, and this is probably the most frustrating domestic problem that I have faced. Having submitted a plan, a comprehensive program to make [GPE] invulnerable against foreign oil cartels in [DATE], I hate to admit it, but the [ORG] has done nothing affirmative either on their plan--if they have one--or on my plan, which I submitted. I think the [NORP] people are frustrated in this area, and our credibility as a government is harmed. I still think we can do something here, but we have to achieve this improved credibility [CARDINAL] ways--by people in Government appearing to be human and by having the Government do things affirmatively. [INTERVIEWER]. [PERSON]. [5.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], the latest poll shows that [PERSON] is not doing too well in the form of popularity. I wonder if you'd give us some thoughts on the polls and how much faith you have in him and whether [PERSON] continues to go this way that he will not be your running mate the next time around? [INTERVIEWED]. Of course, you recognize the final decision as for myself as the [NORP] candidate and the Vice-[INTERVIEWED]ial candidate will be made by the delegates to the Republican Convention. I am, of course, interested in the polls, both personally as well as concerning any other individual for [INTERVIEWED] or Vice [INTERVIEWED], but I do not think that should be the sole criteria. I believe that a candidate for [INTERVIEWED] or Vice [INTERVIEWED] must be either approved or disapproved on the job that is done. If a [INTERVIEWED] does a good job, even though the immediate public opinion polls may not be favorable, I think the delegates ought to approve him, and the same for [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]. Now, in the case of [PERSON], I picked him because he had done a fine job in [GPE]. He has done far better as [ORG] [INTERVIEWED] than I could possibly have expected. He is a hard worker. He is a good team player. He has got a vast amount of experience. I think those attributes will be watched, and the delegates will respond to them at the Republican Convention. So, based on performance and expectations, I would assume that the delegates would probably nominate him. [INTERVIEWER]. If I may interpret, as we so-called political experts do, that sounds sort of like an endorsement for the [ORG] [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I certainly have to endorse the job he has done, no question about it. [NORP] [6.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], in your speech to [ORG], 1 you promise that economic and social equality will become a reality for black [NORP]. That is a rather easy surface promise to make to a group that represents [CARDINAL] potential votes. How do you plan to make that a reality, your promise? [INTERVIEWED]. In the first place, we are going to get the economy as a whole out of the recession, and we are on our way now to, I think, a substantially improved economic picture. In the process of that, the black [NORP] will also benefit, as all other [NORP] will. If we look back on [DATE], [PERSON], we find that more blacks have gone to college, more blacks are entering better paying jobs. We are doing our utmost to improve living conditions for all disadvantaged people, including blacks. We are seeking to enforce very vigorously the equal employment opportunity legislation. I appointed a friend of mine from [GPE], [PERSON], who you may or may not know, as the new Chairman of that very important [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission, and they are going to do a good job. So, through a combination of circumstances, the general improvement plus specific actions, I believe that blacks as a whole, particularly those in the lower end of the spectrum economically, will be the beneficiaries. [7.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I'd like to ask you a question about the Middle East. [GPE], for the first time, is becoming directly involved there, and quite deeply, with the prospect of stationing technicians. Do not you owe it to the [NORP] people in these circumstances to make public every [NORP] commitment that is being made and every detail of the deal that [GPE] has helped bring about between [GPE] and [GPE]? [INTERVIEWED]. We have submitted all of the official documents to the [CARDINAL] committees in the [ORG]--[ORG] and [ORG]--and Secretary [PERSON] has testified to those [CARDINAL] committees and the [CARDINAL] [ORG]. We are working out arrangements to give the documents that I mentioned plus the content of any other communications between me and the heads of state. of [GPE] on the [CARDINAL] hand and [GPE] on the other. Now, we have committed to give the content of those documents and those communications, but I do not think--it has never been done in the past--that a direct communication between a [INTERVIEWED] and another head of state should be made public. As long as the content is there, the commitment is there. I think that is adequate assurance to the [NORP] people. I would add, the commitment that we have made at the request of [GPE] on the [CARDINAL] hand and [GPE] on the other--they made them to us--authorizing [CARDINAL] [GPE] technicians, nonmilitary, in a [ORG] buffer zone--all of the details concerning that part of the agreement will be made public. [INTERVIEWER]. The exact words, though, will not be available. The sense of it will be filtered through selected Congressmen and Senators. Is that not right? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, the exact words of our commitment of up to but not more than 200 [NORP] technicians will be made public, no question about that. [INTERVIEWER]. I understand that, but things like the level of aid that is to be given to [GPE] and-- [INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, no, I must correct the record there. There is a negotiation going on now between [GPE] and [GPE] as to the amount of [DATE] aid, economic and military. When I submit the budget request for the total foreign aid program on a worldwide basis, I will submit the details of the request of economic and military aid for [GPE] just as I will do it in the case of [GPE]. But that will all come as a part of the package for the total worldwide foreign aid program. [8.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], it has been suggested that we use our grain for [NORP] oil or for somebody's oil. You currently have someone working on that in [GPE] now, we are told. What kind of a deal do you see, sir? [INTERVIEWED]. We have a high level group of negotiators under Assistant Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] in [GPE] now negotiating for a long-term purchase agreement by [GPE] up to, say, [DATE] for [NORP] grain and other agricultural products. We feel that a long-term agreement with minimums and maximums is in the best interests of the farmer and the country, as well as our relations with [GPE]. Now, there are some very preliminary discussions going on concerning grain and oil, but they have not gone beyond very preliminary discussions. [INTERVIEWER]. Have you reached some level of amounts when you talk in terms of oil? Have you set a figure or a number of barrel amount? [INTERVIEWED]. We have no specifics, because these are preliminary discussions. [GPE], we understand, does have a surplus of oil. We have a surplus of grain. So, at least we ought, in a very preliminary way, just discuss any alternatives, but we have not gone beyond that. [INTERVIEWER]. Has any kind of barter arrangement--if [GPE] cannot supply the oil in exchange for grain, are you hoping that they will exert their influence over the [NORP] who listen to them? [INTERVIEWED]. I think there is a better way to exercise our influence with the [NORP] nations, and that is through [ORG], which was set up or promoted primarily by [GPE] [DATE], where the basic industrial consuming nations have joined together to meet with the producing nations, [ORG], for example. We are negotiating directly with them. I think that has more potential than relying on [GPE] to help us with the [NORP] nations. Our relations with the [NORP] nations are good. I do not think we have to go through [GPE] in this case or any other case, as far as dealing with [NORP] nations. [9.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if [GPE] is expelled from [ORG], would [GPE] withdraw, and can you foresee any circumstances that might prompt the [GPE] to withdraw from the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWED]. I do not expect [ORG] to kick [GPE] out, and of course, [GPE] would vigorously protest and vote against any such effort on the part of any nation or nations. We believe that the prospects for that happening have subsided considerably, particularly since the agreement between [GPE] on the [CARDINAL] hand and [GPE] on the other. If we can continue to have momentum in the Middle East--which I think will continue--the prospects of [NORP] nations and other nonaligned nations trying to kick [GPE] out becomes less and less. In other words, the position of [GPE] in [ORG] becomes stronger as we keep momentum going for a solution, a long-term solution, to the problems in the Middle East. To answer your last question, I foresee no circumstances where [GPE] would leave [ORG]. I think it would be a mistake. It is good for us to be a part of that forum, to have an influence -- [INTERVIEWER]. You know we have had problems there in the past. [INTERVIEWED]. We have problems in other forums as well. I have always found the best way to win a game is to play it, not to sit on the sidelines. And [GPE] ought to be in the game in [ORG] to protect our interests. It is a lot better inside than sitting out doing nothing. [INTERVIEWER]. Would it be in the interests of [GPE] to try to arrive at. a formula sometime so that [GPE] and [GPE] could enter [ORG]? They were vetoed this time because of the connection with [GPE]. But is not it true that [GPE] continues to have a great interest in that part of the world, and is not there a danger that relations with [GPE] and South Vietnam can get into a deep freeze the way [GPE] and [GPE] did for [DATE], to nobody's advantage? [INTERVIEWED]. We believe in the universality of [ORG]. We feel that it is in the interest of the world as a whole to have all nations that want to become a part of [ORG] be members, but the effort of [GPE] [GPE] to get in was predicated on their coming in alone. We felt if [GPE] [GPE] were to be a part of [ORG], [GPE], that has had its application in to be a member for [DATE], also ought to be included. You cannot be selective on who or what nation should be a part of [ORG]. I presume, based on our overall interest in matters involving Southeast Asia, that it is conceivable under certain circumstances that our relations with [GPE] South Vietnam will improve, but a lot has to happen. For example, [GPE] continues to refuse to give us information concerning the MIA's, and they try to bribe us by saying, We will give you information about MIA's if you will let us in [ORG]. Well, [GPE] agreed in [DATE] to give us information, to give us access to North Vietnam to find the [ORG]'s, and they have not lived up to it. So, how can we trust them? They have got a lot of things to do before we are going to be very receptive to their participation. [10.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], busing is a subject and a practice that is distasteful to a large segment of the [NORP] population, both black and white. If it is such a distasteful and wasteful process, why bus? And is there any alternative that you see? [INTERVIEWED]. I think we have to decide in the first place what we are really trying to do by busing before you discuss whether it is good or bad. All of us-white, black, every [NORP], in my opinion--wants quality education. Now, the [ORG] decided in [DATE] that separate but equal schools were unconstitutional, and the courts have decided that busing is one way to try and desegregate on the [CARDINAL] hand and perhaps improve education on the other. Many of those decisions have raised great problems in many, many localities-[GPE] and [GPE] being the most prominent at the present time. Discussing those [CARDINAL] communities, let me very strongly emphasize the [ORG] has decided something. That is the law of the land. As far as my Administration is concerned, the law of the land will be upheld, and we are upholding it. But then I think I have the right to give what I think is a better answer to the achievement of quality education, which is what we all seek. And there is always [CARDINAL] answer. I think that quality education can be enhanced by better school facilities, lower pupil-teacher ratios, the improvement of the neighborhood, as such. Those are better answers, in my judgment, than busing under a court order. Quality education can be achieved by [CARDINAL] method. I was reading in [ORG] [TIME] a column by [CARDINAL] of the outstanding black columnists, [PERSON]. And [PERSON] has come to the conclusion that court-ordered forced busing is not the way to achieve quality education for blacks or whites in a major metropolitan area. That is a very significant decision by [PERSON], who I think [PERSON], for example, highly respects. [INTERVIEWER]. I certainly do. In [GPE] and [GPE], where the court has ordered busing, how well do you think the people of those [CARDINAL] cities have conducted themselves in bringing about court-ordered exchanges of black and white students? [INTERVIEWED]. There has been some disorders there over [DATE] or more. [INTERVIEWER]. I am thinking about [DATE]. There have been [ORG] agents there, of course, to try to maintain order. Are you reasonably well satisfied with the way things have happened or not? [INTERVIEWED]. So far there has been a minimum of local disorder. I hope that that attitude can prevail in [DATE] as the police involvement and the [ORG] marshal involvement becomes less and less. I am always an optimist, even though I disagree with the method by which they are trying to achieve quality education. [INTERVIEWER]. Well, are you counseling the people of those [CARDINAL] cities to cooperate with the courts, or are you encouraging them to maintain their strong feelings in some cases that this is an improper solution? [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE] I did a televised tape urging the people of [GPE]. to cooperate with the court and to maintain law and order.2 I did that then, and I have counseled everybody that I talked with in [GPE] to encourage their fellow [NORP] to obey the law and follow the court's action. [INTERVIEWER]. We have time for [CARDINAL] short question and [CARDINAL] short answer. [DATE] [INTERVIEWED]IAL CAMPAIGN [11.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], assuming your nomination, will you agree to broadcast debates with the nominee of the other party? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, that gets into some problems involving the current law. I am not sure that a public debate on television is the best way for the public to analyze a candidate. I do not rule it out, but I will not make any firm commitment at this time. [INTERVIEWER]. What about a public debate on radio? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it is a possibility, but I would not want to make a firm commitment at this time. MRS. [PERSON] [12.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a cartoon in the newspaper recently mentioned that your wife's comments on the [ORG] program Face the Nation [ [ORG] ] would only hurt your campaign if she ran against you. [Laughter] How do you feel about that? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am very proud of her, and we have had a wonderful marriage. We have in our family the right of [PERSON], as well as the children, to speak their minds. I think she was misunderstood to some extent, but I repeat, I am proud of her and we have had a very happy marriage. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED], for being with us [DATE] in [GPE]. Welcome, again. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}

I do worry when I look at all of the things that you people do not report about, with what is happening. If you take a look at, you know, [DATE] worth of missing texts that is a lot of missing texts. And as I said [DATE], that is prime time. So you do sort of look at that and say, What is going on? You do look at certain texts where they talk about insurance policies or insurance where they say the kinds of things they are saying, you gotta be concerned. But I would love to do that, and I'd like to do it as soon as possible. When will you do it, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? Do you have a date set? So here is the story Do you have a date set, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? I do not know, no. I guess you are talking about [DATE], but I would love to do it. In person? You know, again, it is I have to say subject to my lawyers and all of that but I would love to do it. Would you do it under oath, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? You mean like [PERSON] did it under who said that? I said that. Oh. Would you do it under oath? Oh you said it. You did say it. You say a lot.

Do you really not have an idea? I will give you an idea. She did not do it under oath. But I would do it under oath. Listen, but I would do it. And you know she did not do it under oath, right? She would do it under oath. If you did not know about [PERSON], then you are not much of a [INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], you are going to do it under oath? To reach a higher standard, you would do it under oath? Oh, I would do it under oath. You would? Absolutely. Do you trust the [ORG]? Well, what am I going to say? I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent. When you look at [DATE]? This is the late great [PERSON], right? [inaudible] This is a large-scale version of this. That was [TIME], this is [DATE]. They say it is [CARDINAL] texts and it is prime time. That is disturbing. Should [PERSON] go? Should [PERSON] go, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? Well, [PERSON] got [MONEY] from essentially [PERSON]. And is he investigating [PERSON]? So should he go? Do you remember, did anybody hear many of my speeches when I talked about [PERSON]? He was the star of my speech. This is not now. And I said a man who was more or less in charge of her the wife got [MONEY] from [PERSON]. Now [PERSON] is [PERSON]. And, yeah, I mean Do you regret having him as your acting [ORG] director, then? You know what, I keep out of it. You'd find that hard to believe. I keep out of it. That is the way it fell. He is been there. It is one of those things. But he was the star of many of my speeches. Because he got [MONEY], 000, whatever the number was. Got that money for the wife. And, you know, in [GPE] Did you ask him who he voted for? It is very interesting. [INTERVIEWER]s: [crosstalk] Wait. In [GPE], you do not have to spend the money. So I never checked as to whether or not they spent the money on the campaign. How much of the money did he spend on the campaign, do you know she how much was it? [INTERVIEWER]s: [crosstalk] Wait, how much of the money was spent? Did you ask who he voted for? You know. Did you ask [PERSON] who he voted for? Did you ask him that? I do not think so.

[laughter] I do not think that is a big deal. But I do not remember that. I saw that [TIME]. I do not remember asking him that question. Is it possible you did? Is it a possibility? I do not remember asking him the question. I think it is also a very unimportant question, but I do not remember asking him that. [crosstalk] Hey, chief, would you do me a favor?

I only repeat for the purposes of making sure you understand. [CARDINAL] more quick one do you think [PERSON] will be fair to you in this larger investigation? We are going to find out. Are you concerned about it? Because here is what we will say, and everybody says: No collusion. There is no collusion. Now they are saying, Oh, well, 'Did he fight back? Did he fight back?' You fight back, 'Oh, it is obstruction.' So, here is the thing: I hope so. How do you define collusion? [PERSON] asked this earlier during the briefing to [PERSON] You are going to define it for me, OK? But I can tell you, there is no collusion. I could not have cared less about [NORP] having to do with my campaign. The fact is you people will not say this, but I will say it: I was a much better candidate than her. You always say she was a bad candidate. You never say I was a good candidate. I was one of the greatest candidates. Nobody else would have beaten the [PERSON] machine, as crooked as it was.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithrussianitartass", "text": "AboutSearch [INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for this, again, unique opportunity to talk with you. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, sir. [INTERVIEWER1]. You first time met with President [PERSON] in [GPE], and now in [GPE] is going to be your 12th meeting. What kind do you think we need now? Do we need a fresh start? And what do you expect for this meeting? [INTERVIEWED]. You know, it is interesting. First of all, we do not need a fresh start in my personal relationship with [PERSON]. We are friends, and that is important. It is important so that we can he and I can have good talks, and we can understand each other and understand the decision-making process. [PERSON] makes a lot of decisions. And I make a lot of decisions. And I like to talk about him about, Well, why did you do this? or Why did you do that? And I suspect he likes to ask me the same questions. Secondly, we have got the framework for a good strategic relationship, which is important. I think this relationship can be invigorated. The campaign came, and in [NORP] public life, I mean whether it be foreign policy or domestic policy, often you kind of shut down when the campaign comes. People were not really sure who was going to be the next President for a while. It turned out to be me, thankfully. But and so this is a chance to reinvigorate. I would not say fresh fresh start is okay. I'd call it reinvigorate. We have got the framework, and it gives us a chance to move it forward. There is a lot we need to do, a lot we need to work together on. 60th Anniversary of V-E Day [INTERVIEWER1]. V-Day in [GPE] in [DATE] [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. [DATE], World War II was ended. Your father was a pilot, was a hero of Second War. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER1]. What the best the people who can to those who won the war. What can you say to the patriots? You are invited to [GPE] for the [INTERVIEWED]. I am coming. Oh, yes, I want to make sure everybody understands I am coming. My answer is, is that, thank you for your sacrifice. The [NORP] veterans the people of [GPE] went through an unbelievable period of time of sacrifice. The stories of courage and bravery against the onslaught of the [NORP] was really fantastic. I mean, it was a great lesson for bravery. And same in our country they call it [ORG] ; that is what they call the World War II people because they sacrificed. And it still this world still requires sacrifice in different ways. But there is still needed sacrifice to make sure there is peace. And I am looking forward to the celebrations. [INTERVIEWER1]. The wartime alliance, do you have lessons for us now? We have again the common enemy. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes. No, we do. And that is another thing [PERSON] and I will talk about. He sees clearly the common enemy. He is a and he knows you got to be tough to and resolute and strong. And we will talk about that common enemy that is still active. The enemy there is a set of beliefs they believe in, and I believe the best way to defeat those beliefs is by spreading freedom and democracy. Free societies do not like to fight. Free societies spend more time listening to their people and the demands of their people as opposed to being able to fight and spread in this case fighting an ideology that is an ideology of hatred as this as your good country full fully understands. [INTERVIEWER1]. [NORP]-Russian relationship what was the biggest success during your first term? And what are your plans for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED]. I appreciate that. Look, I think the biggest success would be twofold: [CARDINAL], an understanding of the war the world we live in and the war on terror. Now, the enemy hit us, and they hit [GPE]. They hit us in a gruesome way, and they hit [GPE] in a gruesome way [PERSON], these movie theaters. I mean, there are all kinds of terrible events that have taken place. And so there is a common understanding that we need to work together on the war on terror. And that is important. The other thing was the Moscow Treaty. We kind of recognized that an era has gone by, that we are reducing our nuclear stockpiles. And that is important too. Ahead, there is a lot of things we can do. We can work on proliferation. We can work on on disease and hunger. We can work on [GPE] to make sure the [NORP] do not have a nuclear weapon. We continue to work on [GPE]. We continue to work for Middle Eastern peace. And the road-map is an opportunity for [GPE] and [GPE] to cooperate to convince [GPE] and the [NORP] to do what is necessary to achieve peace. And so there is a lot we can do.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalcancerinstituterecommendationsmammographyandexchangewithreporters", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Secretary [PERSON] has just briefed me on [ORG] new recommendations on mammography. These recommendations, based on the latest and best medical evidence, give clear, consistent guidance to women in our national fight against breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly every [NORP], including my own. We may not yet have a cure for breast cancer, but we do know that early detection and early treatment are our most potent weapons against this dread disease and we know that mammography can save lives. That is why it is important to send a clear, consistent message to women and to their families about when to start getting mammograms and how often to repeat them. After careful study of the science, [ORG] has now concluded that women [DATE] should get a mammography examination for breast cancer [DATE], in consultation with their doctors. [ORG] has now accepted these recommendations. Now women in [DATE] will have clear guidance based on the best science, and action to match it. [DATE] I am taking action to bring [ORG], [ORG], and the [ORG] employee health plans in line with [ORG] recommendations. First, in the [ORG] budget I am sending to [ORG] [DATE] I am making [DATE] screening mammography exams, beginning at [DATE], a covered expense without coinsurance or deductibles. Second, Secretary [PERSON] is sending a letter to State [ORG] directors urging them to also cover [DATE] mammograms beginning at [DATE] and assuring them that [ORG] will pay its matching share if they do so. And [DATE] I am directing [ORG] to require all Federal health benefit plans to comply with [ORG] recommendations on mammogram screenings, beginning [DATE]. [ORG] is doing its part to make sure women have both coverage and access to this potentially lifesaving test. I want to challenge private health insurance plans to do the same. They, too, should cover regular screening mammograms for women [DATE]. Finally, we know there has been much discussion on this issue and a lot of confusion. That is why we are launching a major public education campaign to make sure every woman and every health care professional in [GPE], that all of them are aware of these new recommendations. This is a major step forward in our fight against breast cancer. In addition to Secretary [PERSON], I want to thank [ORG] Chairperson Dr. [PERSON] and all the members of the Board, along with the [ORG] Director, Dr. [PERSON], for the fine job that they did in producing these recommendations. I also want to thank the First Lady, who could not be with us here because of her visit to Africa. She has devoted [TIME] to educating women about the importance of mammography, and this is [DATE] for her. She has especially tried to educate older women to take advantage of the [ORG] coverage of mammograms, because we know that too few of them still do. And that is the last point I would like to make. These guidelines and this coverage, it is all very good, but unless women are willing to actually take advantage of the coverage, we will not have the full benefit of the recommendations and the findings that have been made. Now I'd like to turn the microphone over to Secretary [PERSON] to make a few comments. [INTERVIEWER] [SPEAKER], do you have any comment on the mass suicide in [GPE]? [SPEAKER]. Well, of course, all I know is what I read about it [TIME] and what I saw [TIME] reported. But it is heartbreaking; it is sickening; it is shocking. I think it is important that we get as many facts as we can about this and try to determine what, in fact, motivated those people and what all of us can do to make sure that there are not other people thinking in that same way out there in our country, that are not so isolated that they can create a world for themselves that may justify that kind of thing. It is very troubling to me. But I do not think I know enough to make a definitive comment about it. [INTERVIEWER] [SPEAKER], switching gears on another subject, [ORG] emerged from this most recent election in the aftermath of all of these fundraising problems it seems to be in pretty bad shape financially enormous debt that they cannot repay. What, if anything, can you do about this, and how much responsibility do you have to try to get [ORG] back into shape? [SPEAKER]. Oh, a lot, and I have been doing a lot, and I will do more. We knew that we would have to spend [DATE] when it became obvious that our congressional candidates were going to be outspent massively, we did everything we could to raise a good deal of money at the end. But the committees and [ORG] went into debt with money that they could legally borrow in the hope of trying to be competitive. They actually did a pretty good job. They were still outspent, I figure, in [DATE] [DATE], probably [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] in all of the contested races. But we knew that would happen, and we knew it would take some time to pay it back. But I am not particularly concerned about it. I think we will pay it back. And it was, I thought, important. Keep in mind, we were at the bottom of the barrel in [DATE], and in [DATE] we did a good job, I think, of building our party back and showing what the clear differences were between the [CARDINAL] parties. And the previous leadership of the party deserves a lot of credit. We got [CARDINAL] small donors, and they are coming back now. They are beginning to make their contributions, and that is very encouraging. So I think we will get there. I am not particularly concerned about it. We made a deliberate decision to kind of downplay the Inaugural and not to try to tie too much of that to fundraising, so we are going to have to work harder [DATE]. But I have been doing some work, as you know, and I will continue to do more. [INTERVIEWER] Do you think Governor [PERSON] has second thoughts about some of the changes that previously eliminating contributions from subsidiaries of foreign companies and also [NORP] citizens he seems to be having some second thoughts about some of those proposals you made over [DATE]. [SPEAKER]. Well, let me say, I still do not believe I think, on balance, it is better policy to say that people who cannot vote should not contribute. In terms of the subsidiaries, the real problem there is the law says if the money is made in [GPE], it can be given in [GPE]. The problem is, how do you ever know that? And so I think that he was trying to bend over backwards to get us off on the right foot. But I'd be willing to talk to him about it. But the main thing is we are just going to have to get together and work hard and rally our troops and remind them of what we are trying to do here, how we are trying to balance the budget, what we are trying to do for education, what we are trying to do to move the country forward and get the efforts going. We have had several successful events [DATE]. We just have to do more. And we knew what you have to do after an election, when we saw all this third party money and all these other things coming down the pike, we wanted to give our Members of [ORG] a chance to be competitive, and so we undertook to do so. And I am glad we did, but we are just going to have to work double hard now to pay the money back, and we will do that. We will pay our debts, and we will make our budget [DATE]. [INTERVIEWER] Have you received any updates from Ambassador [PERSON] or the Vice President? [SPEAKER]. Yes. [INTERVIEWER] And what have they been? [SPEAKER]. Well, Ambassador [PERSON] had a very good meeting with Chairman [PERSON], and he is proceeding now on his trip. And I do not have anything else to tell you, but he was encouraged by the response of Chairman [PERSON] to the matters that we discussed here before he left. I started [DATE] [TIME] with physical therapy and a talk with the Vice President in [GPE], which was also good therapy. [Laughter] And he said to me that in every aspect, his trip had gone quite well and better than he had anticipated, and he was anxious to get back and give me a report on all the issues that we are concerned about. But I think the trip has been a real validation for our strategy of engagement with [GPE], of taking our agreements, our disagreements, our matters of common interest, our matters of concern directly to them. And he is very pleased with the results so far, and I certainly am very pleased with the work he is done, with the speech he gave on human rights and with all the work that he is done in [GPE] so far. I am encouraged about it. I think the trip has been well worth making. [INTERVIEWER] Have you seen that [PERSON] gave [PERSON] a ringing endorsement [TIME] every confidence in his leadership at the [ORG]? [SPEAKER]. Well, as I said of course, she works with him [DATE], and that is why I said [DATE] what I did. I was troubled by the headline in the [ORG] story, but I did not know the facts. And I think it is important for me not to assume that someone has done or failed to do something that is adverse to the national interest before I know it is true. And she is the one that has to make those calls. And as she said in her comments, the system that we have [SPEAKER] appoints the Director of the [ORG], but the [ORG] is a part of [ORG]. It is a part of the justice system. And whenever you have dual responsibilities in the Government, you are going to have some time when you have got to make a close call. And I still do not know as I said, I just literally do not know I could actually tell you whether I agreed or disagreed, if I knew what if and what information had not been forthcoming to [ORG]. I do believe that there should be a that doubt should be resolved in favor of disclosure to [ORG] of essential national security information. But the Attorney General has to resolve those things. And I trust her to do it. And so, what she said is fine by me. [INTERVIEWER] Is there a problem if [SPEAKER] of [GPE] a lot of [NORP] simply do not understand [SPEAKER] of [GPE] says, I do not know that there is a problem because I have not necessarily been given [SPEAKER]. Well, I think there is. Yes, I think there is. If I knew that one existed, I would agree that there was a problem. But I do not know it. And I am still not sure that there was. I just have to I have to trust the Attorney General to make sure that [ORG] gets the information that we need to make good national security judgments here. I think, for example, in the [FAC] incident, there is absolutely not a shred of evidence that there is anything that we have been denied. And so, if I knew that there was and I knew what it was and I thought there was a mistake, I'd be happy to say that there is an honest disagreement here, but I just do not know that there is one. [INTERVIEWER] Has your administration been hamstrung in terms of ambassadorial appointments, appointments at [ORG] and so forth because of all of these investigations on the campaign? [SPEAKER]. No, not at all. As a matter of fact, we have been working on getting ready for the next round of ambassadorial appointments. I approved a small number of them, oh, probably [DATE] so we could move in critical countries. But the others we are trying to do on a schedule which at least guarantees that all the Ambassadors now serving will do the traditional [DATE] tour of duty. So we have some time on them. But we have worked very hard for [DATE] or so on that, and I do not see those [CARDINAL] things as in conflict or a problem at all. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER] How do you feel [DATE]? [SPEAKER]. I feel fine. [DATE] I am getting a little more mobile, and I am getting able to, you know, do a little more. I will tell you [CARDINAL] thing, I would not wish this on anyone. But it is been a very enlightening experience, a very humbling experience. And the respect that I feel now for people who spend [DATE] in a wheelchair or people who spend [DATE] [DATE] in braces and on crutches is enormous. The dignity and the strength of character that it takes to kind of organize your life and carry it out if you are always subject to some sort of significant physical disability is enormous. These are things that we all sometimes see, but when you have felt just a little taste of it, when you realize what it means to be able to just navigate and do the basic things in life just to dress yourself for the first time when you could not do it, for example it just makes you understand that the rest of us in society who have been fortunate enough to have full use of our physical facilities owe an enormous amount of respect and sensitivity to people who do not . It is just been a stunning experience for me. I mean, I will never again see a person who has to deal with a disability in the same light again. I mean, it is just it is had a profound impact. It is nothing I did not know before, but feeling it and knowing it are [CARDINAL] different things. [INTERVIEWER] Thank you, [SPEAKER]. [SPEAKER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER] Like your doctor after you all the time? [SPEAKER]. Yes. She just wants to make sure I do not blow it. [INTERVIEWER] I see her we see her right here. [SPEAKER]. There she is. [INTERVIEWER] She is watching. [SPEAKER]. These crutches are quite good. This way you can walk by putting your bad leg down and keeping the weight here. Otherwise, you have to just do this and then kind of do that. But if you can walk, it is a lot easier; the chances of falling are less. [INTERVIEWER] They are better than the traditional crutches.

Well, you in the press may be getting tired of seeing me [DATE] [DATE]. I am going to see you again later too. But I hope my colleagues are not tired of seeing me; they just got here. Look, what we are doing is at the request of mutual request of us getting together, getting leading [NORP] in the [ORG] together to see if we can work out something on a compromise on infrastructure. And I know they are sincere about it, and so am I. And what we are going to try to do is figure out what we can agree constitutes infrastructure from each of our perspectives and then see whether or not we are in a position that how much we want to fund it above the baseline, the baseline, meaning what we spent [DATE]. And then, we will talk about how to proceed from there. But I assure you I know, Senator [PERSON], this is in good faith Senator [PERSON]. Yes. [INTERVIEWED]. It is a genuine effort. I think we can get there. And I am hoping that just in case, I brought along [CARDINAL] of the Secretaries who are smarter than I am so they can answer the really tough questions. But all kidding aside, I am looking forward to this meeting. And I want to thank you all for coming in, and we appreciate you being here. So thank you for being here. Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation [INTERVIEWER] Mr. President, are you open to a deal that is not fully paid for? [INTERVIEWED]. I am going to get a chance to talk to you later.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthejobtrainingpartnershipact", "text": "[SPEAKER]. Well, hello and welcome to all of you. It is wonderful to have you here and to see you joining in this important step forward for [GPE]. [DATE] this country was in the grip of not [CARDINAL], but [CARDINAL] severe problems: runaway government spending, double-digit inflation, record high interest rates they'd just hit [PERCENT] the worst tax burden in peacetime history, and high unemployment. With support from the [NORP] people we put in place a program that was designed to cure this raging economic disease which had been ignored for too many years. [DATE] passed since our program went on the books, but already we have made solid progress against [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] problems that we inherited. We have cut the growth of spending somewhere around in half, and we have reduced high inflation, high interest rates, and taxation. But let me just say something here about interest rates, which I will expand on in my speech to the [ORG] [TIME]. The very sharp and heartening decline that we have seen in interest rates brings us [CARDINAL] step closer to the dream every [NORP] shares, which is lasting recovery. But let us understand that what brought, for example, [ORG]-backed home mortgages down to [PERCENT], the lowest level in [DATE], was not a quick fix, but our progress against inflation. The decline in inflation led directly to the fall in interest rates during [DATE]. [ORG] announced [DATE] that it was lowering its discount level to [PERCENT]. That is the first time this key interest rate has been a single digit since [DATE] and the fifth reduction in the rate in [DATE]. The [ORG]'s lower rate shows its confidence that inflation and market interest rates are continuing to fall. [ORG] has been pursuing a steady policy of trying to reduce inflation, and we have been supporting the [ORG] in that policy. And the [ORG] will continue to aim its policy at bringing inflation down further in the future. And that will continue to mean lower and lower interest rates as well. As I said, we are solving [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] worst problems that we inherited. But unemployment, always the lagging indicator, remains too high, and clearly, our most urgent priority [DATE] is to create lasting, private sector jobs. I am not going to rest until every [NORP] who wants a job can find a job. Unemployment is a tragedy for all [NORP] in every region, every city, and every line of work. We need the strength of every back and the power of every mind to lift our nation from the economic swamp to higher ground. We must not waste the energy of [CARDINAL] citizen who wants to work. All of us are moved by the plight of [CARDINAL] of our people who cannot find jobs or provide for their families. Perhaps the cruelest trap of all has caught the legions of our youth. As they stand on the threshold of the [NORP] dream, far too many find the door of opportunity slammed in their face. [CARDINAL] out of every [CARDINAL] people out of work-[CARDINAL] out of every [CARDINAL] are [DATE]. We continue to push for enterprise zones in our inner cities, a program to attract new businesses and jobs to areas of highest unemployment. It is tragic that this enterprise zone proposal has been bottled up in committee by the leadership of the [ORG]. I remember what it was like to be [DATE] and looking for a job in [DATE]. And I know how it feels when your future has been mortgaged by the generation before you. And that is a tragic mistake we must never allow our leaders to make again. [DATE]'s young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past. The only way to avoid making these mistakes again is to learn from them. It is estimated, for example, that [CARDINAL] [NORP] workers now rely on skills that will not be needed within [DATE]. The government has trained [CARDINAL] more in skills that already are not needed in their communities. Still others have been steered into make-work government for our young people. And that is why I am proud [DATE] to sign into law the Job Training Partnership Act, a program that looks to the future instead of the past. This is not another make-work, dead-end, bureaucratic boondoggle. This program will train [CARDINAL] [NORP] [DATE] in skills they can market where they live. It will make a difference on [FAC]. It will provide help, bring hope, and encourage self-reliance and personal initiative. And here is how it'll work. State and local government officials, business and labor leaders, and other members of the private sector will plan area programs in private industry councils. Local people will decide at the grass roots level what opportunities are available in their communities, and then match real jobs with needed skills. And here is something else that makes this program different from many past failures. [PERCENT] of the program funds will go to actual job training. We are eliminating the bureaucratic and administrative waste that has marked so many so-called job bills in the past. There is another reason for confidence in this measure. It is based on a tried and tested concept. The young people that are with me here [DATE] have already benefited from local programs very similar to the one we are about to enact nationwide. And I am going to give some examples. [PERSON] here a high school student from [GPE]. He learned clerical skills and found a part-time job in a law firm because of [ORG], a training program in this area. [PERSON], who came to [GPE] from [GPE], received on-the-job training sponsored by [ORG] and now works part-time as a computer operator while attending college. A little while ago I told him what a change this was between generations, because I worked my way through college washing dishes in the girls' dormitory. And [PERSON], who once supported [CARDINAL] children on unemployment benefits, enrolled in [ORG]. She graduated in [DATE], began work for [ORG], and did so well that-she told me a little earlier she is starting a business of her own as a consultant in word processing. Now, these are [CARDINAL] examples of the opportunity this approach holds for [CARDINAL] of [NORP]. Long-time workers who've lost their jobs because of new technology, women who cannot find work because their home-making skills are not marketable, young people who are not hired because they have no experience all will be helped by this program. And let me just add a special word of thanks to Senators [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON] and Congressmen [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON] for their leadership in getting this legislation passed. And now, if you young people will just pay attention or gather around close, I am going to sign the bill. That is the bill. I only sign the last page. Reporter. Well, you know the [NORP] are calling this blatant [DATE] politics, [SPEAKER]. [SPEAKER]. That does not surprise me a bit. But it does not make it any more true. Q. Is it true, [SPEAKER]? [SPEAKER]. What? Q. Is it true? [SPEAKER]. No. Q. Why not? [SPEAKER]. Because this is the type of program that we have been talking about that is really going to accomplish something. Deputy Press Secretary [PERSON]. That is enough. It is not a press conference. I am sorry. [SPEAKER]. Is not he mean? I was enjoying it. Q. But you are free to continue, sir. Q. You are [SPEAKER]. [SPEAKER]. No, I cannot do that. But I want you to know though, as I say, all these young people are an example of what these kind of programs can do, and out there government has a legitimate function. But that legitimate function, I think, in this area means cooperating and working with the private sector, where the jobs with a future really are.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference450", "text": "For several reasons, I shall want to take some of the time available to us [DATE], actually to read to you a statement. Now, Mr. [PERSON] tells me that a mimeograph of it is being made and is going to be over here before the conference is ended. If that is true, I suggest there is no need for your making notes during the time I am dealing with this paper. The paper deals with an approach to the security problem, and there are [CARDINAL] reasons that I should like to take it up [DATE]. First, I have sent down [DATE] to the [ORG] a reorganizational plan for [ORG]. It is not radical in most ways, certainly, but it does attempt to point up that organization so as to secure a greater effectiveness, economy, speed in action, and more rapid production of materiel that has been appropriated for. Another reason is that there is just back, as you know, from Europe, a team which the administration sent over there: the Secretary of [ORG], the Secretary of the [ORG], Secretary of [ORG], and the Director of Mutual Security. They have all returned, or at least all have returned except Secretary [PERSON]; and we have been having conferences on this same global problem. And finally, I met [TIME] with some of the legislative leaders, and we had this problem up for a long and exhaustive discussion. So I want to give you really the approach that we are now making toward this problem. I would like to present to you in a general way, and with fairly broad strokes, what I consider the sensible framework within which [GPE] and its allies can present in hard military fact an ever more effective posture of defense. A true posture of defense is composed of [CARDINAL] factors--spiritual, military, and economic. [DATE] I shall talk only about the last [CARDINAL]. We [NORP] have frequently called for unity of basic purpose among our allies. I feel quite strongly that the least we can do is to display a similar continuity and unity in [NORP] purpose. This policy of ours, therefore, will not be tied to any magic, critical [DATE] which then has to be stretched out because of economic or production problems, but will be based on the sounder theory that a very real danger not only exists [DATE], but may continue to exist for [DATE] to come; that our strength, which is already very real, must now be made stronger, not by inefficient and expensive starts and stops, but by steady continuous improvements. I have always firmly believed that there is a great logic in the conduct of military affairs. There is an equally great logic in economic affairs. If these [CARDINAL] logical disciplines can be wedded, it is then possible to create a situation of maximum military strength within economic capacities. If, on the other hand, these [CARDINAL] are allowed to proceed in disregard [CARDINAL] for the other, you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength, or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy. It has been the purpose of this administration ever since it took office, finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises, commitments, and contracts, to bring [NORP] military logic and [NORP] economic logic into joint strong harness. No more glaring illustration of the lack of balance between the military logic and the economic logic could possibly be found than the situation that existed when we took office. On the [CARDINAL] hand, we found our allies deploring our unfulfilled defense promises. On the other hand, we found there was a total carryover of [MONEY] in appropriated funds, largely committed, for which cash must be provided from revenues in [DATE], over and above the normal [DATE] cost of government. It is just as if the late administration had gone to the store and ordered [MONEY] worth of goods, which we have got to pay for as they are delivered, in addition to paying the regular household running expenses. The fiscal situation represented by these [CARDINAL] extremes absolutely has to be brought into some kind of realistic focus, and the only way to do it is to have a completely new, fresh look without any misleading labels. As you know, over [DATE] I have been involved in the [NORP] end of defense, and therefore I think I know all about paper divisions and cardboard wings. For [DATE], I have been heavily involved in the [NORP] end of defense, and [DATE] after day have had to struggle with the basic equation that links the military safety of this country and of the free world with the ability of the world to pay its bills and earn a living. [TIME] I told the legislative leaders that already we can see our way clear to ask the [ORG] to appropriate [CARDINAL] less in new money for [DATE] than had been asked for by the previous administration. This is a preliminary figure based on [DATE] hard work. The great bulk of it, of course, relates to security programs. More definite figures will become available as appropriation requests are presented to the [ORG] during [DATE]. You will note that I have been talking about the new appropriations for [DATE]. Actual cash savings for [DATE] will be determined only as [ORG] acts on the appropriation requests. These savings will not reduce the effective military strength we will deliver to ourselves and our allies during [DATE]. [Interrupts reading] Those deliveries are already appropriated for. They are already on the books and in contracts. [Continues reading]: Deliveries actually will be speeded up through the reduction of lead time, and concentration on producing those items which make the most military sense for the immediate future. Establishing the most effective relationship between defense requirements and economic capability in [DATE] is probably the most complex and ramified problem to be faced by any government. Practically everyone concerned with the problem can with some justification be a special pleader. But I am sure that what the overwhelming majority of [NORP] want to believe is that their Government is working with diligence and intelligence to bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of true military strength. I also believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of the free world appreciate the fact that a healthy [NORP] economy and a functioning economy in their own home country are inseparable from true defense. Furthermore, I have a deep conviction that all these people possess a fundamental common sense Which permits them to grasp the difference between a quiet, steady, long-term improvement in their defense position and the tempests stirred up by public arguments over the artificial arithmetic which is so easy to produce in the defense field. The program we are presenting is a long-term program, calling for a steady and adequate flow of men and materials to present a position of genuine strength to any would-be aggressor. The basic elements of our strategic problem have not materially changed in [DATE], and certainly not in [DATE]. The areas and peoples vital to our Nation's welfare are the same as they have been for a long time. What we are doing is to adopt a new policy for the solution of the problem. This change in policy is radical and cannot be effected [TIME]. There exists what is, in effect, a straitjacket, comprising prior authorizations, appropriations, and contracts. The essence of the change is this. We reject the idea that we must build up to a maximum attainable strength for some specific date theoretically fixed for a specified time in the future. Defense is not a matter of maximum strength for a single date. It is a matter of adequate protection to be projected as far into the future as the actions and apparent purposes of others may compel us. It is a policy that can, if necessary, be lived with over a period of years. Finally, I would like to remind you of what I have said many times before, and will probably say many times again. Security based upon heavy armaments is a way of life that has been forced upon us and on our allies. We do not like it; in fact, we hate it. But so long as such an unmistakable, self-confirmed threat to our freedom exists, we will carry these burdens with dedication and determination. Our hope and our prayer is that this dedication and determination will bring about a world condition when we can once again return to the arts of peace, which we have always and will always cherish above all other arts. That is the end of my statement. I read it because I wanted to make it exactly as I have been thinking over it in [DATE]. Now gentlemen, the rest of the time is yours. [INTERVIEWED], can you tell us of any specific field in which there will be a reduction, say, in the size of forces, or what effect this might have, say, on [ORG], its plans to build up to--I think it is [CARDINAL] groups? [INTERVIEWED] As to long-term objectives that may have been specified, I cannot tell you exactly what will be the effect. But I can tell you this: there will be more buildup in [DATE] than was possible under the operations and the activities as they were proceeding in [DATE]. This is due to the shortening up of lead times, and the concentration on critical areas and items. Q. May I put it this way, [INTERVIEWED]? As a result of these cuts, will we have fewer people in the armed services in [DATE] ahead? [INTERVIEWED] If you look far enough ahead, Mr. [PERSON], that is possibly true. We cannot tell yet, because we have been here [DATE]. There is a tremendous job of inspecting and analyzing of forces, personnel, activities throughout the world. It stretches all the way around the world, this activity of which we are speaking. It is impossible to find the utmost of efficiency, businesslike methods, starting right back at the production line, until you get to the end. So until we know what those examinations, analyses, and corrections will yield, we cannot say what the final result will be. Q. [INTERVIEWED], this increased buildup in [DATE], will that be in [CARDINAL] of the armed forces? [INTERVIEWED] I should think so. Q. In general? [INTERVIEWED] Again I say I should think so; and I say this advisedly: we have been going over these things--you do get a little bit confused in trying to remember exact detail. But the fact is that in [DATE], there is nothing deducted in the way of money, and there is added the idea of shortening up of lead times, and getting these things proper. Q. If you attain this preliminary figure of an [MONEY] decrease, sir, will that not mean a balanced [ORG] budget in [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] No, it does not, because I particularly specified new money, money that you are requesting in new authorizations. To be exact, the budget now before the [ORG] asked for [CARDINAL]. This is an [CARDINAL]--at least in that order, [CARDINAL]--reduction in that, that we now believe we can do after [DATE]. And I am giving you that, as I say, as a tentative figure. But that is not the deficit. The deficit comes about from the amount of the appropriated money of [DATE] that will be spent, added to the amount of carried-over money that will be spent, and deduct from that your anticipated revenues. Incidentally, anticipated revenues will probably be a bit lower. Now, that is the deficit. Therefore the [CARDINAL] which you probably had in your mind will not be reduced by [CARDINAL]. No, it will not. Q. I want to get straightened out, is this [CARDINAL] just in defense and military aid, or is it the overall? [INTERVIEWED] Overall, and I said, the great bulk of which, of course, is in security programs. Q. Will you give us some figures on military and foreign aid? [INTERVIEWED] No. Q. [CARDINAL] Member of [ORG] has said your [CARDINAL] savings in appropriations will be translated into a [CARDINAL] savings in expenditures. Do you have such a figure? In other words, actual spending? [INTERVIEWED] We have, of course, dealt with all kinds of figures, and the reason I told you that--actual figures or estimates are not going to be available until we go before [ORG], Because there is no sense in creating confusion. We are not certain of those figures, and there will be changes, both in the expenditure figures and in the new appropriations figures. I am giving you simply the order of the savings that we expect to accomplish in the new appropriations. Q. You are not prepared at this time to give any figure? [INTERVIEWED] That is correct. Q. Some of us are under the impression, sir, that [DATE] of maximum exposure that you now discourage, came about because [ORG] thought that in [DATE] the [NORP] could deliver an atomic attack on [GPE]. Is there something now that is available to you and [ORG] which indicates that will not be a possibility? [INTERVIEWED] I am not going to quarrel with their estimate on when they will have atomic bombs. But I do not admit that anyone can predict when, if ever, another government would want to launch global war. I just do not believe there is a necessary relationship between those [CARDINAL] concepts. Q. Is it true, sir, that considering the carryover funds and other money available, that there will be about as much money for our allies in [DATE] as in the present? [INTERVIEWED] You mean as much money spent in [DATE] I have forgotten the exact figure. Q. About how much? [INTERVIEWED] As a matter of fact, I must tell you, I definitely determined not to talk in more exact figures than I have already given you [DATE] because I was so certain that some of them would become confused. I have dealt with nothing but figures for [DATE]. I will say this: the expenditure program for [DATE], of course, is very largely fixed. As I said, it is in something of a straitjacket, so that the changes that will be made will be gradual. But I will not be more exact on the expenditure program for foreign aid in [DATE] than that. Q. [INTERVIEWED], could you explain in a little more detail how your long-range concept of a long-range program differs from the previous administration's military program, which called for reaching a peak of strength sometime in [DATE], and then maintaining that strength over the long pull? [INTERVIEWED] Well, let me ask you this: if you have a maximum production program, to reach maximum strength by [DATE]--or any other figure, how do you then suddenly level off and maintain it? It is simply not possible. You cannot suddenly reach with all your production lines up and say everything is shut off and becomes [CARDINAL]. You have a job of leveling this thing out, and it means it has to be approached really, literally, [DATE] ahead. So it is a change--instead of going to a maximum in the belief you can predict at a certain point--to do this thing in as orderly a fashion, making always the economic factor the secondary, but the important support to your strictly defense factor. Now, it is really no more susceptible of exact statement than that, but you cannot go full blast with all productive capacity to a single point and then suddenly just level off. You cannot do it. Q. Since presumably not all of the [CARDINAL] reduction in appropriations will be reduction in spending during [DATE], is it now definite that there will not be a balanced budget for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] Well, I think it would be safe to say that you cannot achieve--I do not see how you can achieve complete balance in your expenditure program. I do not believe it could be done. Q. [INTERVIEWED], [DATE], Congressman [PERSON], who was then the chairman of [ORG], said that [ORG] would cut the budget by [CARDINAL]. Now, if they cut it below your [CARDINAL], would they seriously hamper the defense program, do you feel? [INTERVIEWED] Well, if they cut very far, it would require very definite changes in policy, yes. Actually, these people that I am talking about--the professional people, the civilians, everybody else--have been working very hard to find that money that you can find in a hurried or, you might say, an intensive but quick examination of this thing. There will finally be great or, at least, other savings accomplished. When you get into the field of logistics, of procurement, storage, issue, evacuation, care of sick and wounded, there are lots of places; but I would say that those cuts cannot be made suddenly and in great amount without causing a great deal of embarrassment. Q. Can you tell us, on the basis of the outline you have given us, what the possibilities seem to you to be for a tax cut now? Any change in that? [INTERVIEWED] No, I am not going to speculate on that one just now, Mr. [PERSON]. Q. Do your figures, [INTERVIEWED], include an expenditure for the Korean war? [INTERVIEWED] Yes. They include certain items that have never been included before; for example, budgeting for ammunition. Q. Does that anticipate a reduction in the cost of the Korean war over [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] Well, I do not believe I have got the exact comparison of it, Mr. [PERSON]. I do not believe I have. Q. I would like to ask you [CARDINAL] final question. Does your new policy indicate that there will be a new kind of a defense establishment? The point I am getting at-- [INTERVIEWED] Not radical, not radical. We do want to concentrate more on the latest weapons, and in this buildup that I am talking about--orderly buildup--constantly getting the latest and best to prevent the factor of obsolescence from overtaking us too quickly. That is [CARDINAL] factor for which we take a little bit of credit. Q. Are those the critical items of which you speak? [INTERVIEWED] Yes, indeed. Q. [INTERVIEWED], do these figures in your program mean that there will be a new team on your [ORG] after their terms expire? [INTERVIEWED] I am afraid that is something you will have to talk to the Secretary of [ORG] about. That is his responsibility. Q. [INTERVIEWED], this question was asked a little while ago, but I did not get the answer clearly. You were asked if you regarded, with this reduction in cash spending, a reduction also in income, whether it is definite that there will not be a balanced budget for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] I said I thought it was safe to predict that complete balance in the expenditure program probably would not be achieved. I do not know; I do not see how the full amount can be met. However, I will tell you this: there is progress made in that direction [DATE]. Q. [INTERVIEWED], if you open up the Key West agreement, will you open up also the roles and missions assignments made there? [INTERVIEWED] Well, I must tell you, Mrs. [PERSON], I am not going back into some of those things. I have got other things that occupy my time, and I have got people to go into them. Now finally it will-- Q. I thought the message to [ORG] would mention this. [INTERVIEWED]--it will be--there are certain philosophies of control, particularly emphasizing civilian control, that are contained in the plan that went to [ORG] [DATE], and I assume that will be made public in a day or so. Q. [INTERVIEWED], do you plan to spend some time in [GPE] [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] I hope so. [Laughter] Q. Could you give us a little run down on when we go? [Laughter] [INTERVIEWED] Well, I will be perfectly frank with you. I think that whatever [ORG] does would determine something of my own moves. And I will promise this group this, if it is of any interest to you: as quickly as I get any real information on it, then I will let you know, and let you know what I expect to do; because I realize that you people, after all, go on vacations, too. I would like to go, and I am planning on doing it, if the situation here in [GPE] will allow me. Q. I wanted to ask whether there remains in your request a [MONEY] item for production equipment to provide mobilization base? [INTERVIEWED] I do not remember the size of that item. I do not remember the size of it. Q. Does it remain an identifiable item? [INTERVIEWED] I do not see how you can take it out completely. Q.Can you say, sir, in what [DATE] you do expect a balanced budget? Do your studies go that far? [INTERVIEWED] Well, I would have to put it relatively. I must say that a great deal of my waking moments are given over to that problem. And we are going to do it. Now, that is all I can say. Q. [INTERVIEWED], since you expect to shorten lead time on military items, will the defense expenditures be greater over [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED] Well, that is probably true. I have not asked for the exact schedule of output of money, but that would sound to me like it were true, yes. And it would mean also, of course, a very reduced carryover of money that is appropriated and has not yet been raised at [DATE]. If you use up some of that carryover now, and then do not ask for as much new money as you have in the past, then you reduce that carryover from an [MONEY] figure down to something else. Q. [INTERVIEWED], do we have an estimate of income for [DATE] yet? [INTERVIEWED] Yes, we do; but as a matter of fact, I am not going to give it [DATE], because [TIME] the question was raised as to its authenticity. There is one in the budget now before [ORG]. You know that; I think it is--68.7 is not it?--that is close to it. But there is some question raised about it. Q. [INTERVIEWED], in regard to the [PERSON] committee study of the [ORG] departments, their recommendations which I imagine will be released very shortly-- [INTERVIEWED] [PERSON]? Q. [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, I beg your pardon. It is my mistake, sir. THE. PRESIDENT. Go ahead. Now I am on the track. Q.I wanted to ask on what lines their views went toward reorganization of [ORG] with this idea in mind, that over [DATE] there had been [CARDINAL] schools of thought, fundamentally: [CARDINAL] that wanted to have a loose federation of the services, each one sovereign in its own right; and the other school of thought that wanted strong central control. I wanted to ask which, could you tell me--to which school of thought do you subscribe to--and [PERSON] [INTERVIEWED] Well, first of all, I am not certain how the [PERSON] committee met that problem because, you see, they have been my committee for reorganizing in other departments of [ORG]. And when it came to [ORG], because of the size of it, I loaned them to Mr. [PERSON], who appointed a committee of his own, and they were incorporated into it. Now, just exactly what that committee felt about the points you raise, I do not know. I do feel this: that all of us agree that each of these departments should be separately administered, that it is inconsistent, I should say, with good management that we do not have real central direction so far as there are any fields in which duplication or waste can occur. The business of war, and preparing for war, has just got so unconscionably expensive that we cannot waste [MONEY] uselessly. Now, the purpose of putting a strong business organization-which you devoutly hope will stay out of details that are none of its business; but after all, people are human, we understand that-their purpose is to save money through effective management for [GPE]. Now, that is what it is. And what they have to do: I do not believe that any of us are smart enough--and I put in [DATE] in that business, as you know--I do not believe any of us are smart enough to lay out a blueprint for a perfect organization. I believe you have to try something and correct it a little, and try something else and correct it a little. Sometimes you never really get done--we finally go to war, many things affect organization. So I think here, I hope we never get so rigid and solidified that we cannot change when we need to. Q. [DATE] the [ORG] announced they were taking [ORG] out of service. [INTERVIEWED] It did what? Q.It was taking [ORG] out of service-deactivating it--a training division. Was that done after consultation with you? [INTERVIEWED] No, that would not have to come to me, and I have not heard of it before. Q. Will the budget reductions you are contemplating bring about a balanced cash budget in [DATE], sir? [INTERVIEWED] That is the third time that question has been asked, and I will answer it again. I do not think that it possibly can, because the expenditures for [DATE] are already fixed by contracts, by commitments that we cannot get out of. It cannot be done. That new money has nothing to do, really, with the cash budget for [DATE]. Q. I was speaking of the--of the cash income and cash outgo, not the-- [INTERVIEWED] The income is fixed by tax law, is not it? Not fixed by this budget that we are asking for at all. It is fixed by tax law. The outgo is fixed by plans that are already in existence, by appropriations that have already been made. Now, largely that is true. You have certain detailed differences. But there is nothing much you can do about that particular item that you raise. Q.Sir, are you planning a conference [DATE] with the Governor of [GPE] and the Governor of [GPE] on the question of oil imports? [INTERVIEWED] I have not heard of it. I am having all the Governors here very quickly; but the only thing I heard, I have been challenged to a golf game by [CARDINAL] of the Governors. [Laughter] Q. Which one?
