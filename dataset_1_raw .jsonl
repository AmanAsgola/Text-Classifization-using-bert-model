I deeply feel the responsibility which goes with your nomination for President of the United States at this grave hour of our nation's history.","That I have not sought this responsibility, all of you know. I told the people of my State, two years ago, that it was my intention to devote my full term as governor exclusively to their service. You have decided other-wise. In accordance with the principles of our republican form of government you have laid upon me the highest duty to which an American can be called. No one has a right to refuse such a call. With the help of God, I will try to be worthy of the trust. I accept the nomination.","I am happy and proud to be associated with my good friend from the State of Ohio, John W. Bricker. For many months, John Bricker has gone from state to state telling the people of the issues, of the great need for better government, for the sound principles of government, and the leader-ship which will come to it with a Republican victory this year. Never before have I seen such good sportsmenship as that displayed by John Bricker here this morning and I am proud to be associated with him.","I come to this great task a free man. I have made no pledges, promises or commitments, expressed or implied, to any man or woman. I shall make none, except to the American people.","These pledges I do make:","To men and women of the Republican Party everywhere I pledge my utmost efforts in the months ahead. In return, I ask for your support. Without it, I cannot discharge the heavy obligation you lay upon me.","To Americans of every party I pledge that on Jan. 20 next year our government will again have a cabinet of the ablest men and women to be found in America. The members of that Cabinet will expect and will receive full delegation of the powers of their office. They will be capable of administering those powers. They will each be experienced in the task to be done and young enough to do it. This election will bring an end to one-man government in America.","To Americans of every party I pledge a campaign dedicated to one and above all others—that this nation under God may continue in the years ahead a free nation of free men.","At this moment on battlegrounds around the world Americans are dying for the freedom of our country. Their comrades are pressing on in the face of hardship and suffering. They are pressing on for total victory and for the liberties of all of us.","Everything we say or do today and in the future must be devoted to the single purpose of that victory. Then, when victory is won, we must devote ourselves with equal unity of purpose to re-winning at home the freedom they have won at such desperate cost abroad.","To our allies let us send from this convention one message from our hearts: The American people are united with you to the limit of our resources and manpower, devoted to the single task of victory and the establishment of a firm and lasting peace.","To every member of the axis powers, let us send this message from this Convention: By this political campaign, which you are unable to understand, our will to victory will be strengthened, and with every day you further delay surrender the consequences to you will be more severe.","That we shall win this war none of us and few of our enemies can now have any doubt. But how we win this war is of major importance for the years ahead. We won the last war but it didn't stay won. This time we must also win the purposes for which we are fighting. Germany must never again nourish the delusion that she could have won. We must carry to Japan a defeat so crushing and complete that every last man among them knows that he has been beaten. We must not merely defeat the armies and the navies of our enemies. We must defeat, once and for all, their will to make war. In their hearts as well as with their lips, let them be taught to say: \"Never again.\"","The military conduct of the war is outside this campaign. It is and must remain completely out of politics. General Marshall and Admiral King are doing a superb job. Thank God for both of them. Let me make it crystal clear that a change of administration next January cannot and will not involve any change in the military conduct of the war. If there is not now any civilian interference with the military and naval commands, a change in administration will not alter this status. If there is civilian interference, the new administration will put a stop to it forthwith.","But the war is being fought on the home front as well as abroad, while all of us are deeply proud of the military conduct of the war, can we honestly say that the home front could not bear improvement? The present administration in Washington has been in office for more than 11 years. Today, it is at war with Congress, and at war with itself. Squabbles between Cabinet members, feuds between rival bureaucrats and bitterness between the President and his own party members, in and out of Congress, have become the order of the day. In the vital matters of taxation, price control, rationing, labor relations, manpower, we have become familiar with the spectacle of wrangling, bungling and confusion.","Does anyone suggest that the present national administration is giving either efficient or competent government? We have not heard that claim made, even by its most fanatical supporters. No, all they tell us is that in its young days it did some good things. That we freely grant. But now it has grown old in office. It has become tired and quarrelsome. It seems that the great men who founded this nation really did know what they were talking about when they said that three terms were too many.","When we have won the war, we shall still have to win the peace. We are agreed, all of us, that America will participate with other sovereign nations in a cooperative effort to prevent future wars. Let us face up boldly to the magnitude of that task. We shall not make secure the peace of the world by mere words. We can't do it simply by drawing up a fine-sounding treaty. It can not be the work of any one man or of a little group of rulers who meet together in private conferences. The structure of peace must be built. It must be the work of many men. We must have as our representatives in this task the ablest men and women America can pro-duce, and the structure they join in building must rest upon the solid rock of a united American public opinion.","I am not one of those who despair of achieving that end. I am utterly confident we can do it. For years, we have had men in Washington who were notoriously weak in certain branches of arithmetic but they specialized in division. They've been playing up minor differences of opinion among our people until the people of other countries might have thought that America was cleft in two.","But all the while there was a larger, growing area of agreement. Recently the overwhelming majesty of that broad area of agreement has become obvious. The Republican Party can take pride in helping to define it and broaden it. There are only a few, a very few, who really believe that America should try to remain aloof from the world. There are only a relatively few who believe it would be practical for America or her allies to renounce all sovereignty and join a Super-state. I certainly would not deny these two extremes the right to their opinions; but I stand firmly with the overwhelming majority of my fellow citizens in that great wide area of agreement. That agreement was clearly expressed by the Republican Mackinac Declaration and was adopted in the foreign policy plank of this Convention.","No organization for peace will last if it is slipped through by stealth or trickery or the momentary hypnotism of high-sounding phrases. We shall have to work and pray and be patient and make sacrifices to achieve a really lasting peace. That is not too much to ask in the name of those who have died for the future of our country. This is no task for men who specialize in dividing our people. It is no task to be entrusted to stubborn men, grown old and tired and quarrelsome in office. We learned that in 1919.","The building of the peace is more than a matter of international co-operation. God has endowed America with such blessings as to fit her for a great role in the world. We can only play that role if we are strong and healthy and vigorous as nature has equipped us to be. It would be a tragedy if after this war Americans returned from our armed forces and failed to find the freedom and opportunity for which they fought. This must be a land where every man and woman has a fair chance to work and get ahead. Never again must free Americans face the spectre of long-continued, mass unemployment. We Republicans are agreed that full employment shall be a first objective of national policy. And by full employment I mean a real chance for every man and woman to earn a decent living.","What hope does the present administration offer here? In 1940, the year before this country entered the war, there were still 10,000,000 unemployed. After seven years of unequalled power and unparalleled spending, the New Deal had failed utterly to solve that problem. It never solved that problem. It was left to be solved by war. Do we have to have a war to get jobs?","What are we now offered? Only the dreary prospect of a continued war economy after the war, with interference piled on interference and petty tyrannies rivaling the very regimentation against which we are now at war.","The present administration has never solved this fundamental problem of jobs and opportunity. It can never solve this problem. It has never even understood what makes a job. It has never been for full production. It has lived in chattering fear of abundance. It has specialized in curtailment and restriction. It has been consistently hostile to and abusive of American business and American industry, although it is in business and industry that most of us make our living.","In all the record of the past 11 years is there anything that suggests the present administration can bring about high-level employment after this war? Is there any reason to believe that those who have so signally failed in the past can succeed in the future? The problem of jobs will not be easily solved; but it will never be solved at all unless we get a new, progressive administration in Washington—and that means a Republican administration.","For one hundred and fifty years America was the hope of the world. Here on this great broad continent we had brought into being something for which men had longed throughout all history. Here, all men were held to be free and equal. Here, government derived its just powers from the consent of the governed. Here men believed passionately in freedom, independence—the God-given right of the individual to be his own master. Yet, with all of this freedom—I insist—because of this freedom—ours was a land of plenty. In a fashion unequalled anywhere else in the world, America grew and strengthened; our standard of living became the envy of the world. In all lands, men and women looked toward America as the pattern of what they, themselves, desired. And because we were what we were, good will flowed toward us from all corners of the earth. An American was welcomed everywhere and looked upon with admiration and regard.","At times, we had our troubles; made our share of mistakes; but we faltered only to go forward with renewed vigor. It remained for the past eleven years, under the present national administration, for continuing unemployment to be accepted with resignation as the inevitable condition of a nation past its prime.","It is the New Deal which tells us that America has lost its capacity to grow. We shall never build a better world by listening to those counsels of defeat. Is America old and worn out as the New Dealers tell us? Look to the beaches of Normandy for the answer. Look to the reaches of the wide Pacific—to the corners of the world where American men are fighting. Look to the marvels of production in the war plants in our own cities and towns. I say to you: our country is just fighting its way through to new horizons. The future of America has no limit.","True, we now pass through dark and troubled times, scarcely a home escapes the touch of dread anxiety and grief; yet in this hour the American spirit rises, faith returns—faith in our God, faith in our fellowman, faith in the land our fathers died to win, faith in the future, limitless and bright, of this, our country.","In the name of that faith we shall carry our cause in the coming months to the American people."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresscoeurdaleneidaho","text":["Your excellency, my fellow citizens, it is with the greatest pleasure that I find myself facing an audience in this great State. I echo the wish of the governor that it might be our privilege to stay a long time in Idaho and know something more than her fame, know her people, come in contact with her industries, and see the things that we have all so long read about and admired from a distance; but, unfortunately, it is necessary for us to go back to Washington as soon as we can, though it was a great pleasure to escape from Washington. Washington is a very interesting place, but it is a very lonely place. The people of the United States do not live there, and in order to know what the people of the United States are thinking about and talking about it is necessary to come and find out for yourself. That really is my errand.","I have taken pains since I was a boy so to saturate myself in the traditions of America that I generally feel a good deal of confidence that the impulses which I find in myself are American impulses; but no matter how thoroughly American a man may be, he needs constantly to renew his touch with all parts of America and to be sure that his mind is guided, if he be in public station, by the thoughts and purposes of his fellow countrymen. It was, therefore, with the most earnest desire to get in touch with you and the rest of my fellow countrymen that I undertook this trip, for, my fellow countrymen, we are facing a decision now in which we can not afford to make a mistake. We must not let ourselves be deceived as to the gravity of that decision or as to the implications of that decision. It will mean a great deal now, but it will mean infinitely more in the future. America has to do at this moment nothing less than prove to the world whether she has meant what she said in the past.","I must confess that I have been amazed that there are some men in responsible positions who are opposed to the ratification of the treaty of peace altogether. It is natural that so great a document, full of so many particular provisions, should draw criticism upon itself for this, that, or the other provision. It is natural that a world settlement, for it is nothing less, should give occasion for a great many differences of opinion with regard to particular settlements of it, but I must admit that it amazes me that there should be any who should propose that the arrangement be rejected altogether, because, my fellow citizens, this is the issue: We went into this Great War from which we have just issued with certain assurances given ourselves and given the world, and these assurances can not be fulfilled unless this treaty is adopted. We told the world and we assured ourselves that we went into this war in order to see to it that the kind of purpose represented by Germany in this war should never be permitted to be accomplished by Germany or anybody else. Do not let your thoughts dwell too constantly upon Germany. Germany attempted this outrageous thing, but Germany was not the only country that had ever entertained the purpose of subjecting the peoples of the world to its will, and when we went into this war we said that we sent our soldiers across the seas not because we thought this was an American fight in particular, but because we knew that the purpose of Germany was against liberty, and that where anybody was fighting liberty it was our duty to go into the contest. We set this Nation up with the profession that we wanted to set an example of liberty not only, but to lead the world in the paths of liberty and justice and of right; and at last, after long reflection, after long hesitation, after trying to persuade ourselves that this was a European war and nothing more, we suddenly looked our own consciences in the face and said, \"This is not merely a European war. This is a war which imperils the very principles for which this Government was set up, and it is our duty to lend all the force that we have, whether of men or of resources, to the resistance of these designs.\" And it was America never let anybody forget this it was America that saved the world, and those who propose the rejection of the treaty propose that, after having redeemed the world, we should desert the world. It would be nothing less.","The settlements of this treaty can not be maintained without the concerted action of all the great Governments of the world. I asked you just now not to think exclusively about Germany, but turn your thoughts back to what it was that Germany proposed. Germany did direct her first force against France and against Belgium, but you know that it was not her purpose to remain in France, though it was part of her purpose to remain in Belgium. She was using her arms against these people so that they could not prevent what she intended elsewhere, and what she intended elsewhere was to make an open line of dominion between her and the Far East. The formula that she adopted was Bremen to Bagdad, the North Sea to Persia to crush not only little Serbia, whom she first started to crush, but all the Balkan States, get Turkey in her grasp, take all the Turkish and Arabian lands beyond, penetrate the wealthy realms of Persia, open the gates of India, and, by dominating the central trade routes of the world, dominate the world itself. That was her plan; and what does the treaty of peace do? For I want you to remember, my fellow countrymen, that this treaty is not going to stand by itself. The treaty with Austria has now been signed; it will presently be sent over, and I shall lay that before the Senate of the United States. It will be laid down along exactly the same lines as the treaty with Germany; and the lines of the treaty with Germany suggest this, that we are setting up the very States which Germany and Austria intended to dominate as independent, self-governing units. We are giving them what they never could have got with their own strength, what they could have got only by the united strength of the armies of the world. But we have not made them strong by making them independent. We have given them what I have called their land titles. We have said, \"These lands that others have tried to dominate and exploit for their own uses belong to you, and we assign them to you in fee simple. They never did belong to anybody else. They were loot. It was brigandage to take them. We give them to you in fee simple.\" But what is the use of setting up the titles if we do not guarantee them? And that guaranty is the only guaranty against the repetition of the war we have gone through just so soon as the German nation, 60,000,000 strong, can again recover its strength and its spirit, for east of Germany lies the fertile field of intrigue and power. At this moment the only people who are dealing with the Bolshevist government in Russia are the Germans. They are fraternizing with the few who exercise control in that distracted country. They are making all their plans that the financing of Russia and the commerce of Russia and the development of Russia shall be as soon as possible in the hands of Germans; and just so soon as she can swing that great power, that is also her road to the East and to the domination of the world. If you do not guarantee the titles that you are getting up in these treaties, you leave the whole ground fallow in which again to sow the dragon's teeth with the harvest of armed men.","That, my fellow citizens, is what article 10, that you hear so much talked about in the covenant of the league of nations, does. It guarantees the land titles of the world; and if you do not guarantee the land titles of the world, there can not be the ordered society in which men can live. Off here in this beloved continent, with its great free stretches and its great free people, we have not realized the cloud of dread and terror under which the people of Europe have lived. I have heard men over there say, \"It is intolerable. We would rather die now than live another 50 years under the cloud that has hung over us ever since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, because we have known that this force was gathering, we have known what the purpose was ultimately to be, we have known that blood and terror lay ahead of us, and we can not and will not live under that cloud any more.\" America, my fellow citizens, is necessary to the peace of the world. America is absolutely necessary to the peace of the world. Germany realizes that; and I want to tell you now and here I wish I could proclaim it in tones so loud that they would reach the world Germany wants us to stay out of this treaty. Not under any deception. Not under the deception that we will turn in sympathy toward her. Not under the. delusion that we would seek in any direct or conscious way to serve Germany, but with the knowledge that the guaranties will not be sufficient without America, and that, inasmuch as Germany is out of the arrangement, it will be very useful to Germany to have America out of the arrangement. Germany knows that if America is out of the arrangement America will lose the confidence and cooperation of all the other nations in the world, and, fearing America's strength, she wants to see America alienated from the peoples from whom she has been alienated. It is a perfectly reasonable program. She wants to see America isolated. She is isolated. She wants to see one great nation left out of this combination which she never would again dare face. Evidences are not lacking nay, evidences are abounding that the pro-German propaganda has started up in this country coincidently with the opposition to the adoption of this treaty. I want those who have any kind of sympathy with the purposes with which we went into the war now to reflect upon this proposition: Are we going to prove the enemy of the rest of the world just when we have proved their savior? The thing is intolerable. The thing is impossible. America has never been unfaithful and she never will be unfaithful.","Do not let anybody delude you, my fellow citizens, with the pose of being an American. If I am an American I want at least to be an intelligent America. If I am a true American I will study the true interests of America. If I am a true American I will have the world vision that America has always had, drawing her blood, drawing her genius, as she has drawn her people, out of all the great constructive peoples of the world. A true American conceives America in the atmosphere and whole setting of her fortune and her destiny. And America needs the confidence of the rest of the world just as much as other nations do. America needs the cooperation of the rest of the world to release her resources, to make her markets, above all things else to link together the spirits of men who mean to redeem the race from the wrongs that it has suffered. This western country is par excellence the country of progressivism. I am not now using it with a big P.\" It does not make any difference whether you belong to the Progressive Party or not; you belong to the progressive thought, and I hope every intelligent man belongs to the progressive thought. It is the only thought that the world is going to tolerate. If you believe in progress, if you believe in progressive reform, if you believe in making the lot of men better, if you believe in purifying politics and enlarging the purposes of public policy, then you have got to have a world in which that will be possible; and if America does not enter with all her soul into this new world arrangement, progressives might as well go out of business, because there is going to be universal disorder, as there is now universal unrest.","Do not mistake the signs of the times, my fellow countrymen, and do not think that America is immune. The poison that has spread all through that pitiful nation of Russia is spreading all through Europe. There is not a statesman in Europe who does not dread the infection of it, and just so certainly as those people are disconcerted, thrown back upon their own resources, disheartened, rendered cynical by the withdrawal of the only people in the world they trust, just so certainly there will be universal upsetting of order in Europe. And if the order of Europe is upset, do you think America is going to be quiet? Have you not been reading in the papers of the intolerable thing that has just happened in Boston? When the police of a great city walk out and leave that city to be looted they have committed an intolerable crime against civilization; and if that spirit is going to prevail, where are your programs? How can you carry a program out when every man is taking what he can get? How can you carry a program out when there is no authority upon which to base it? How can you carry a program out when every man is looking out for his own selfish interests and refuses to be bound by any law that regards the interests of the others? There will be no reform in this world for a generation if the conditions of the world are not now brought to settled order, and they can not be brought to settled order without the cooperation of America.","I am not speaking with conjecture, my fellow citizens. I would be ashamed of myself if upon a theme so great as this I should seek to mislead you by overstatement of any kind. I know what I am talking about. I have spent six months amidst those disturbed peoples on the other side of the water, and I can tell you, now and here, that the only people they depend upon to bring the world to settled conditions are the people of America. A chill will go to their heart, a discouragement will come down upon them, a cynicism will take possession of them, which will make progress impossible, if we do not take part not only, but do not take part with all our might and with all our genius. Everybody who loves justice and who hopes for programs of reform must support the unqualified adoption of this treaty. I send this challenge out to the conscience of every man in America, that if he knows anything of the conditions of the world, if he knows anything of the present state of society throughout the world and really loves justice and purposes just reform, he must support the treaty with Germany. I do not want to say that and have it proved by tragedy, for if this treaty should be refused, if it should be impaired, then amidst the tragedy of the things that would follow every man would be converted to the opinion that I am now uttering, but I do not want to see that sort of conversion. I do not want to see an era of blood and of chaos to convert men to the only practical methods of justice.","My fellow citizens, there are a great many things needing to be reformed in America. We are not exempt from those very subtle influences which lead to all sorts of incidental injustice. We ourselves are in danger at this present moment of minorities trying to control our affairs, and whenever a minority tries to control the affairs of the country it is fighting against the interest of the country just as much as if it were trying to upset the Government. If you think that you can afford to live in a chaotic world, then speak words of encouragement to the men who are opposing this treaty, but if you want to have your own fortunes held steady, realize that the fortunes of the world must be held steady; that if you want to keep your own boys at home after this terrible experience, you will see that boys elsewhere are kept at home. Because America is not going to refuse, when the other catastrophe comes, again to attempt to save the world, and, having given this proof once, I pray God that we may not be given occasion to prove it again! We went into this war promising every loving heart in this country who had parted with a beloved youngster that we were going to fight a war which would make that sacrifice unnecessary again, and we must redeem that promise or be of all men the most unfaithful. If I did not go on this errand through the United States, if I did not do everything that was within my power that is honorable to get this treaty adopted, and adopted without qualification, I never could look another mother in the face upon whose cheeks there were the tears of sorrowful memory with regard to the boy buried across the sea. The moral compulsion laid upon America now is a compelling compulsion, and can not be escaped. My fellow countrymen, because it is a moral issue, because it is an issue in which is mixed up every sort of interest in America, I am not in the least uneasy about the result.","If you put it on the lowest levels, you can not trade with a world disordered, and if you do not trade you draw your own industries within a narrower and narrower limit. This great State, with its untold natural resources, with its great undeveloped resources, will have to stand for a long generation stagnant because there are no distant markets calling for these things. All America will have to wait a long, anxious generation through to see the normal courses of her life restored. So, if I were putting it upon the lowest conceivable basis of the amount of money we could make, I would say, \"We have got to assist in the restoration of order and the maintenance of order throughout the world by the maintenance of the morale of the world.\" You will say, \"How? By arms?\" That, I suspect, is what most of the opponents of the league of nations, at any rate, try to lead you to believe, that this is a league of arms. Why, my fellow citizens, it is a league to bring about the thing that America has been advocating ever since I was born. It is a league to bring it about that there shall not be war, but that there shall be substituted for it arbitration and the calm settlement of discussion. That is the heart of the league. The heart of the league is this: Every member of the league, and that will mean every fighting nation in the world except Germany, agrees that it will never go to war without first having done one or the other of two things either having submitted the matter in dispute to arbitration, in which case it agrees absolutely to abide by the result, or having submitted it to consideration by the council of the league of nations, in which case it promises to lay all the documents, all the facts, in its possession before the council and to give the council six months in which to consider the matter, and, if it does not like the opinion of the council at the end of the six months, still to wait three months more before it resorts to arms. That is what America has been striving for. That is what the Congress of the United States directed me to bring about. Perhaps you do not know where; it was in an unexpected place, in the naval appropriations bill. Congress, authorizing a great building program of ships and the expenditure of vast sums of money to make our Navy one of the strongest in the world, paused a moment and declared in the midst of the appropriation bill that it was the policy of the United States to bring about disarmament and that for that purpose it was the policy of the United States to cooperate in the creation of a great international tribunal to which should be submitted questions of international difference and controversy, and it directed the [speaker] of the United States, not later than the close of this war, to call together an international conference for that purpose. It even went so far as to make an appropriation to pay the expenses for the conduct of such a conference in the city of Washington. And that is a continuing provision of the naval appropriations bill. When I came back with this covenant of the league of nations, I had fulfilled the mandate of the Congress of the United States; and now they do not like it.","There is only one conceivable reason for not liking it, my fellow citizens, and to me as an American it is not a conceivable reason; that is that we should wish to do some nation some great wrong. If there is any nation in the world that can afford to submit its purposes to discussion, it is the American Nation. If I belonged to some other nations, there are some things that I know that I would not like to see submitted to the discussion of mankind, but I do not know anything in the present purposes of the United States that I would not be perfectly willing to lay upon any table of counsel in the world. In carrying out the mandate of the Congress, I was serving the age-long purpose of this great people, which purpose centers in justice and in peace.","You will say, \"Well, why not go in with reservations?\" I wonder if you know what that means. If the Senate of the United States passes a resolution of ratification and says that it ratifies on condition that so and so is understood, that will have to be resubmitted to every signatory of the treaty; and what gravels me is that it will have to be submitted to the German Assembly at Weimar. That goes against my digestion. We can not honorably put anything in that treaty, which Germany has signed and ratified, with Germany's consent; whereas it is perfectly feasible, my fellow countrymen, if we put interpretations upon that treaty which its language clearly warrants, to notify the other Governments of the world that we do understand the treaty in that sense. It is perfectly feasible to do that, and perfectly honorable to do that, because, mark you, nothing can be done under this treaty through the instrumentality of the council of the league of nations except by a unanimous vote. The vote of the United States will always be necessary, and it is perfectly legitimate for the United States to notify the other Governments beforehand that its vote in the council of the league of nations will be based upon such and such an understanding of the provisions of the treaty.","The treaty is not susceptible of misunderstanding. I do not object to painting the rose or refining fine gold; there is not any phrase in the covenant of the league of nations that can legitimately be said to be of doubtful meaning, but if the Congress of the United States wants to state the meaning over again in other words and say to the other nations of the world, \"We understand the treaty to mean what it says,\" I think that is a work of supererogation, but I do not see any moral objection to it. But anything that qualifies the treaty, anything that is a condition to our ratification of it, must be submitted to all the others, and we must go over this process again; this process which took six months of intensive labor, which took six months of very difficult adjustment and arrangement, which quieted jealousies, which allayed suspicions, which set aside controversies, which brought about the most extraordinary union of minds that, was ever brought about in so miscellaneous an assembly, divided by so many interests. All that must be gone over again, and in the meantime the world must wait and its unrest grow deeper, and all the pulses of life go slower, waiting to see what is going to happen, all because the United States asks the other governments of the world to accept what they have already accepted in different language. That is all that it amounts to; I means, all that the reasonable reservations amount to. Some of them amount to staying out altogether, some of them amount to a radical change of the spirit of the instrument, but I am speaking now of those which some men of high conscience and of high public purpose are seriously pressing in order that there may be no misunderstanding. You can avoid a misunderstanding without changing the document. You can avoid a misunderstanding without qualifying the terms of the document, because, as I have said and shall say again and again, America is at liberty as one of the voting members of the partnership to state how she understands the articles of copartnership.","I beg that these things may sink in your thoughts, my fellow countrymen, because we are at a turning point in the fortunes of the world. Out upon these quiet hills and in these great valleys it is difficult sometimes for me to remember the turmoil of the world in which I have been mixing on the other side of the sea; it is difficult for me to remember the surging passions which moved upon the face of the other continents of the world; it is difficult for me to remember the infinite suffering that happened even in this beloved country; it is difficult for me to remember the delegations from weak peoples that came to me in Paris, figuratively speaking, with outstretched hands, pleading that America should lead the way out of the darkness into the light; it is difficult out here in this great peace for anybody, even, I dare say, for these fine fellows in khaki who were over there and saw something of it, to remember the whole strain and terror of the thing, but we must remember it, my fellow citizens, and we must see to it that that strain and terror never come upon the world again. It is with this solemn thought, that we are at a turning point in the destinies of mankind and that America is the makeweight of mankind, that I, with perfect confidence, leave this great question to your unbiased judgment."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddresstheannualluncheontheassociatedpressnewyorkcity0","text":["The gathering and publication of news has a deeper significance than is sometimes realized. No large enterprise can exist for itself alone. It ministers to some great need, it performs some great service, not for itself, but for others; or, failing therein, it ceases to be profitable and ceases to exist. This is the case with the Associated Press. It is one of the eyes of mankind which never slumbers. Without ceasing, it assembles each day the events of each part of the world, and transmits them to every other part. The fundamental reason for this lies in the fact that it is felt to be of vital importance to each man, and each community, to know what other men and other communities are doing. The news is printed and read, not for the mere purpose of entertainment, amusement and recreation, but almost entirely for the practical purpose of information, \"in order that by means of accurate knowledge of what others are doing a course may be laid out of accurate and successful action.","Faith in the American people means a faith in their ability to form sound judgments, when once the facts have been presented to them clearly and without prejudice. It is this educational work, national in its scope, that the Associated Press performs, and upon its integrity and fairness depends in large measure the course of public opinion in the United States. This work is done without any tinge of personal or political opinion. A very practical need exists, and it is met by a very practical service. It is individual in its nature. It is a personal service for each one of us, making its appeal entirely to the intelligence of the individual and recognizing fully the American ideal of intellectual independence.","This conception is not exactly at variance with, but certainly supplementary to, the long cherished American ideal of the independence of the individual and the independence of the nation. Granted that the largest possible independence is a desirable goal, the consideration at once arises as to how such independence can best be secured. The work of the Associated Press, both necessary and logical, indicates that the true method would appear to lie in recognizing the broad principle of our individual and national dependence, calculating the requirements which flow from that condition, and governing ourselves accordingly. Complete independence means complete coordination and cooperation. From this principle arises the oft-repeated law of service—we can help ourselves only as we help others. A knowledge and an understanding of others become absolutely necessary, in order to make our ideals practical. One of the preeminent requirements of our country at the present time is to reestablish and emphasize in the public mind this law of service. The danger to America is not in the direction of the failure to maintain its economic position, but in the direction of the failure to maintain its ideals.","The principle of service is not to be confounded with a weak and impractical sentimentalism. It does not mean that either the individual or the nation is to assume the burdens which ought to be borne by others. It is warranted in considering self to the extent of recognizing that it is justifiable to accumulate and hold the resources which must necessarily be used to serve ourselves, our own household, and our own nation. But it does not stop there. It recognizes also the necessity of serving others, and when the need arises for meeting a moral requirement, of making individual and national sacrifices sufficient to maintain the cause of righteousness.","Some of the recent developments in Washington have revealed the dangers to which I refer in a very dramatic way. Beginning nearly 10 years ago our country entered a period when conditions were altogether artificial and abnormal, culminating in the strained and lurid events of our participation in the war. The old standards of action were either suspended or entirely cast aside. Altogether too many of those in a position to do so began to take advantage of the necessities of the situation for their own profit. Finally nearly all of those in responsible positions throughout the entire civilized world had but one main object in view, which was the winning of the war. They began to make almost every consideration and motive subsidiary to that great effort. Totally inconceivable amounts of money were raised and expended with a lavishness which a few months before would have been believed impossible, and which now seems like some wild nightmare. Notwithstanding the great wave of patriotic fervor which swept over the land; notwithstanding the tremendous sacrifices which the people in every walk of life made, and stood ready to make; almost unconsciously these conditions developed, which I mention not for any purpose now to criticize, where the least scrupulous became the greatest gainers and a considerable part of our population was thrown into a morbid financial state of mind, which even the best intentioned did not wholly escape. The desire for profits and more profits kept on increasing, and the quest for easy money became well-nigh universal. All of this meant an attempt to appropriate the belongings of others without rendering a corresponding service.","This condition began to subside nearly four years ago, but it left along its course a trail of vicious and criminal selfishness which in diminishing degree has ever since been attempting to gratify an appetite grown all the sharper through indulgence, and a general credulity to rumors of large sums of money demanded and paid on account of every conceivable motive and action.","From all of this sordidness the affairs of government, of course, suffered. In some of it a few public officers were guilty participants. But the wonder is not that this was so much or so many, rather that it has been so little and so few. The encouraging thing at present is the evidence of a well-nigh complete return to normal methods of action, and a sane public opinion. The gravity of guilt of this kind is fully realized and publicly reprehended. There is an exceedingly healthy disposition to uproot it altogether, and administer punishment wherever competent evidence of guilt can be produced. That I am doing and propose to continue.","Another phase of lingering extravagance, from which the country has not yet fully recovered, is revealed by a consideration of the bills which are pending before the Congress, calling for an expenditure of public money. Exceedingly great efforts have been put forth to reduce the cost of government. Hundreds of thousands of public employees have been released, and every department has been thoroughly deflated and placed under most competent financial supervision. The country as a whole is demanding with great vigor every possible relief from the burden of every unnecessary public expenditure. Yet notwithstanding this, minority groups of one kind or another, and organizations, sometimes almost nation-wide in their ramifications, are making the most determined assaults upon the public treasury. I am advised by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget that careful computation discloses that there are bills pending that are seriously pressed for passage, not including the bonus, which would increase the expenditures of the Federal Government for next year by about $3,600,000,000. This would mean that outside of the Post Office Department, which is practically self-sustaining, the present rate of expenditure would be more than doubled. Each one of these items taken by itself is not large, and its supporters argue that certainly the Government can afford to make this small additional payment. But taken in the aggregate they make the stupendous sum I have mentioned, and their assumption by the Government would mean nothing less than financial disaster to the nation. The law of service must be applied to this situation. Our country is very rich, but were its possessions increased many-fold, it would not be warranted in paying out money except for value received. Value received on the part of the Government is estimated by a general consideration of all the attending conditions. At present our country does not need a greater outlay of expense, but a greater application of constructive economy.","The same state of mind is revealed again in the determined resistance which is made to the adoption of a sound method of taxation.","The main argument of the opposition can all be reduced to the supposition that the general public can be relieved of taxation and a greater proportion of taxes laid oil the rich. I shall not examine the soundness of this proposal, the economic injury which it would inflict, or its impossibility as a working principle. I mention it as another example of an attempt to minister to a supposed desire to evade the law of service. It seems as though the public is assumed to desire to have the advantages of a government without paying its part of the cost of maintaining it. Besides being convinced that such a result is utterly impossible of accomplishment, I am even more firmly of the belief that it misrepresents the general attitude of the public mind. Moreover, the success of the Government does riot lie in wringing all the revenue it can from the people, but in making their burden as light and fairly distributed as possible, consistent with the proper maintenance of the necessary public functions. The Government itself, in order to be successful, and all of those connected with it, must put all of their energy upon what they can do for the people, not upon what they can get out of them.","These are some of the reasons which reveal to us why, in our domestic affairs, we must be possessed of accurate information of the doings and needs of others, in order that we may best serve ourselves by serving them through appropriate action. We are all a part of one common country. To be in a healthy and successful condition economically, means a free interplay of competition in service, based upon that mutual faith in each other which we term public confidence. Notwithstanding the disturbing character of recent revelations, notwithstanding the enormous pressure for the passage of legislation which would greatly increase the cost of maintaining the Government of the United States, notwithstanding the failure of a majority of the Congress up to the present time accurately to comprehend and expeditiously to minister to the need of taxation reform, I believe that the requirements of economy and reduced taxes will be met in a way not inconsistent with the great resources of our country.","While I have thought it desirable to point out dangerous tendencies, I know that with few exceptions the management of our Government has been and is in honest and competent hands, that its finances are sound and well managed, and that the business interests of the nation, including the owners, managers and employees, are representative of honorable and patriotic motives, and that the present economic condition warrants a continuation of confidence and prosperity. Fundamentally, America is sound. It has both the power and disposition to maintain itself in a healthy economic and moral condition. But it can not do this by turning all its thoughts in on itself, or by making its material prosperity its supreme choice. Selfishness is only another name for suicide. A nation that is morally dead will soon be financially dead. The progress of the world rests on courage, honor and faith. If America wishes to maintain its prosperity, it must maintain its ideals.","When we turn to our foreign relations, we see the working out of the same laws. If there is one ideal of national existence to which America has adhered more consistently than to any other, it has been that of peace. Whatever other faults may be charged to our country, it has never been quarrelsome, belligerent, or bent on military aggrandisement. After all, the main support of peace is understanding. It is a matter of accurate information by one government and one people about other governments and other peoples. There is likewise involved the same law of service.","If our country is to stand for anything in the world, if it is to represent any forward movement in human progress, these achievements will be measured in no small degree by what it is able to do for others. Up to a little more than twenty-five years ago, America gave almost its entire attention to self-development. In that it achieved an unequaled success. The service which it rendered to others was to a considerable degree one of example. It revealed the ability of the people to take charge of their own affairs. It demonstrated the soundness and strength of self-government under free institutions, while affording a refuge for the oppressed of other lands. The great influence which the mere existence of American institutions exercised upon the rest of the world would be difficult to overestimate. At the end of a long period of steady accomplishments of this nature came the war with Spain, which left our country a world power with world responsibilities. It is not too much to say that in meeting and bringing to a successful conclusion that conflict our country performed a world service.","This was followed by a period of most remarkable industrial development. There were great consolidations of properties, enormous investments of capital, and a stupendous increase of production, all accompanied by a growth of population reaching many millions. This was our condition at the outbreak of the World War. For a long time we sought to avoid this conflict, on the assumption that it did not concern us. On that subject we were lacking in accurate information. We found, at last, that while it was also the grave concern of others, it did concern us intimately and perilously. We took our part in the war at length, in the defense of free institutions. We believe, while acknowledging that we were only one of the contributing elements, that our participation was a decisive factor. The result was a demonstration of the strength of self-governing peoples, and a victory for free institutions. Our action at this time was distinctly a world service. America made its sacrifice for what it believed was the cause of righteousness.","The sacrifices made on these occasions, which resulted in a benefit to others, resulted likewise in a benefit to ourselves. Even the evil effects which always arise from war and its aftermath have only tempered, not obliterated, these results. A flow of material resources set in toward our country, which is still going on. The general standards of living were raised. In the resulting plenty many of the did hardships of existence were removed. Our country came into a position where it had a greatly increased opportunity for world leadership. In moral power it took a higher rank.","There can be little doubt that our presence at the treaty table softened the terms and diminished the exactions of the victorious nations, where joint covenants of defensive alliance were in part substituted for the usual territorial transfers. Our country refused to adhere to the covenant of the League of Nations with a decisive rejection which I regard as final. Following this came a continuing effort to collect reparations, which the economic chaos of Germany after a time caused to be suspended. This resulted in the French seizure of the Ruhr, with Allied conferences, plans and discussions for renewing payment of reparations under some settled method of permanent adjustment. Although indirectly interested by reason of our commerce, and more especially because of the debts due to us, in having a European settlement, our Government felt that the fundamental questions involved in all these discussions were the direct political concern of Europe. Our policy relative to the debts due to us from European countries was well known, and we refused to submit them to these discussions. This never meant that America was not willing to lend its assistance to the solution of the European problem in any way that did not involve us in their purely political controversies, whenever opportunity presented a plan that promised to be just and effective. But we realized that all effort was useless until all parties came to a state of mind where they saw the need to make concessions and accept friendly counsel.","In December of the year of 1922 our Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, set out the American proposal in an address which he delivered at New Haven. That proposal has now become historic. He recognized that settlement of the reparations question was probably impossible if approached after the method of a political problem. It was not so much a question to be dealt with by public officers or diplomatic agencies, which must necessarily reflect to a very marked degree the political state of mind of the various countries, but was represented as me which could be solved by the application of pure business talent and experienced private enterprise. ,To such an effort of business men, unhampered by every unnecessary political consideration, Mr. Hughes expressed the belief that competent American citizens in private life would be ready to lend their assistance. This position was consistently maintained. Its correctness was finally demonstrated when Mr. Dawes, Mr. Young and Mr. Robinson were invited by the Reparations Commission for that purpose, and consented to serve.","The finding of the experts, which is known as the Dawes Report, has recently been made and published. It shows a great deal of research and investigation, and a broad comprehension of the requirements of the situation. It has been favorably received by the Reparations Commission. It is gratifying to understand that the Allies are looking upon it with full sympathy, and Germany has expressed a willingness to cooperate in the execution of the plan. There appears to be every reason to hope that the report offers a basis for a practical solution of the reparations problem. I trust that it may commend itself to all the European Governments interested as a method by which, through mutual concessions, they can arrive at a stable adjustment of the intricate and vexatious problem of reparations, and that such an outcome will provide for the restoration of Germany and the largest possible payments to the other countries.","If this result is secured, the credit which will be due to the Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes, to [SPEAKER] Harding for adopting it and supporting it, and to the three Americans and their assistants, by whose wisdom and discretion it was formulated and rendered so acceptable, will be sufficient to warrant the lasting approbation of two continents. A situation at once both intricate and difficult has been met in a most masterful way. Our countrymen are justified in looking at the result with great pride. Nothing of more importance to Europe has occurred since the Armistice.","Part of the plan contemplates that a considerable loan should at once be made to Germany for immediate pressing needs, including the financing of a bank. I trust that private American capital will be willing to participate in advancing this loan. Sound business reasons exist why we should participate in the financing of works of peace in Europe, though we have repeatedly asserted that we were not in favor of advancing funds for any military purpose. It would benefit our trade and commerce, and we especially hope that it will provide a larger market for our agricultural production. It is notorious that foreign gold has been flowing into our country in great abundance. It is altogether probable that some of it can be used more to our financial advantage in Europe than it can be in the United States. Besides this, there is the humanitarian requirement, which carries such a strong appeal, and the knowledge that out of our abundance it is our duty to help where help will be used for meeting just requirements and the promotion of a peaceful purpose. We have determined to maintain, and can maintain, our own political independence, but our economic independence will be strengthened and increased when the economic stability of Europe is restored.","We hope further that such a condition will be the beginning of a secure and enduring peace. Certainly it would remove many of the present sources of disagreement and misunderstanding among the European nations. When this adjustment is finally made, and has had sufficient time of operation to become a settled European policy, it would lay the foundation for a further effort at disarmament in accordance with the theory of the Washington Conference. Although that gathering was able to limit capital battleships, it had to leave the question of submarines, air craft, and land forces unsolved. The main reason for this was the unsettled and almost threatening condition that still existed in Europe. A final adjustment for the liquidation of reparations ought to be the beginning of a new era of peace and good will.","In the event that such a condition develops, it becomes pertinent to examine what can be done by our own country, in cooperation with others, further to rid ourselves and the rest of the world of the menace and burden of competitive armaments and more effectively insure the settlement of differences between nations, not by a recourse to arms, but by a recourse to reason; not by action leading to war, but by action leading to justice. Our past experience should warn us not to be overconfident in the face of so many failures, but it also justifies the hope that something may be done where already there has been some success, and at least we can demonstrate that we have done all that we can.","As a result of American initiative there is already in existence the Hague Tribunal which is equipped to function wherever arbitration seems desirable, and based in part on that, and in part on the League, there is the International Court of Justice, which is already functioning. A proposal was sent to the last Senate by [SPEAKER] Harding for our adherence to the covenant establishing this court, which I submitted to the favorable consideration of the present Senate in my annual message. Other plans for a World Court have been broached, but up to the present time this has seemed to me the most practical one. But these proposals for arbitration and courts are not put forward by those who are well informed with the idea that they could be relied upon as an adequate means for entirely preventing war. They are rather a method of securing adjustment of claims and differences, and for the enforcement of treaties, when the usual channels of diplomatic negotiation fail to resolve the difficulty.","Proposals have also been made for the codification of international law. Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction, although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals. One of the difficulties to be encountered would be the necessity of securing the consent of all the nations, but no doubt the agreement of the major Powers would go very far in producing that result.","I do not claim to be able to announce any formula that will guarantee the peace of the world. There are certain definite things, however, that I believe can be done, which certainly ought to be tried, that might relieve the people of the earth of much of the burden of military armaments and diminish the probability of military operations. I believe that among these are frequent international conferences suited to particular needs. The Washington Conference did a great deal to restore harmony and good will among the nations. Another purpose of a conference is the further limitation of competitive armaments. Much remains to be accomplished in that direction. It would appear to be impractical to attempt action under present conditions, but with a certain and definite settlement of German reparations firmly established, I should favor the calling of a similar conference to achieve such limitations of armaments and initiate plans for a codification of international law, should preliminary inquiries disclose that such a proposal would meet with a sympathetic response. But the main hope of success lies in first securing a composed state of the public mind in Europe.","It is my firm belief that America is in a position to take the lead in this direction. It is undoubtedly too much to suppose that we hold very much of the affectionate regard of other nations. At the same time we do hold their respect. Our position is such that we are trusted and our business institutions and Government considered to be worthy of confidence. If there is disappointment in some directions that we do not enter alliances with them, it is more than overbalanced by the knowledge that there is no danger that we shall enter alliances against them. It must be known to every people that we are seeking no acquisition of territory, and maintaining no military establishment with unfriendly and hostile intent. Like our political institutions, all of this is a powerful example throughout the world. Very many of the nations have been the recipients of our favor, and have had the advantage of our help in some time of extremity. We have no traditional enemies. We have come to a position of great power and great responsibility.","Our first duty is to ourselves. American standards must be maintained, American institutions must be preserved. The freedom of the people politically, economically, intellectually, morally and spiritually, must continue to be advanced. This is not a matter of a day or a year. It may be of generations, it may be of an era. It is for us here and now to keep in the right direction, to remain constant to the right ideals. We need a faith that is broad enough to let the people make their own mistakes. Let them come unto knowledge and understanding by their own experience. Little progress can be made by merely attempting to repress what is evil, our great hope lies in developing what is good.","One newspaper is .better than many criminal laws. One schoolmaster is better than a legion of bailiffs. One clergyman is better than an army with banners. These are our guarantees of internal peace and progress.","On what nations are at home depends what they will be abroad. If the spirit of freedom rules in their domestic affairs, it will rule in their foreign affairs. The world knows that we do not seek to rule by force of arms, our strength is in our moral power. We increase the desire for peace everywhere by being peaceful. We maintain a military force for our defense, but our offensive lies in the justice of our cause. We are against war because it is destructive. We are for peace because it is constructive. We seek concord with all nations through mutual understanding. We believe in treaties and covenants and international law as a permanent record for a reliable determination of action. All these are evidences of a right intention. But something more than these is required to maintain the peace of the world. In its final determination it must come from the heart of the people. Unless it abide there, we can not build for it any artificial lodging place. If the will of the world be evil, there is no artifice by which we can protect the nations from evil results. Governments can do much for the betterment of the world. They are the instruments through which humanity acts in international relations. Because they can not do everything, they must not neglect to do what they can. But the final establishment of peace, the complete maintenance of good will toward men, will be found only in the righteousness of the people of the earth. Wars will cease when they will that they shall cease. Peace will reign when they will that it shall reign."," "]}

It was a privilege, sir, to be greeted by you as you have greeted me tonight. No one can too strongly insist upon the elementary fact that you cannot build the superstructure of public virtue save on private virtue. The sum of the parts is the whole, and if we wish to make that whole, the State, decent, the representative and exponent and symbol of decency, it must be so made through the decency, public and private, of the average citizen. Mr. Davis was quite safe in saying he hoped I had enjoyed my stay in San Francisco. I should indeed be ungrateful, unappreciative, if I were not deeply touched and moved by the way in which the people of San Francisco have received me; and I have enjoyed to the full the two days and a half I have spent here. I have enjoyed it all and I have enjoyed no part more, General MacArthur, than my ride down the line, reviewing the troops with you.","Californians are good Americans, and therefore it is not necessary to appeal to them on behalf of the army and the navy. I shall not detain you long this evening. I am promised by Colonel Pippy the chance, after my speech, of meeting and shaking hands with each of you, in the rooms of the Club. I have just got two thoughts, not connected together, to which I want to give utterance tonight; one suggested by something that Mr. Davis said.","It is absolutely essential, if we are to have the proper standard of public life, that promise shall be square with performance. A lie is no more to be excused in politics than out of politics.","A promise is as binding on the stump as off the stump, and there are two facets to that crystal. In the first place, the man who makes a promise which he does not intend to keep and does not try to keep should rightly be adjudged to have forfeited in some degree what should be every man's most precious possession—his honor. On the other hand, the public that exacts a promise which ought not to be kept, or which cannot be kept, is by just so much forfeiting its right to self-government. There is no surer way of destroying the capacity for self-government in a people than to accustom that people to demanding the impossible or the improper from its public men. No man fit to be a public man will promise either the impossible or the improper; and if the demand is made that he shall do so it means putting a premium upon the unfit in public life. ","There is the same sound reason for distrusting the man who promises too much in public that there is for distrusting the man who promises too much in private business. If you meet a doctor who asserts that he as a specific remedy that will cure all the ills to which human flesh is heir, distrust him, He hasn?t got it. If you meet the business man who vociferates that he is always selling everything to you at a loss, and you continue to deal with him I am glad if you suffer for it. Any man who promises as a result of legislation or administration the millennium is making a promise which he will find difficulty in keeping. Any man who asserts that by any law it will be possible, out of hand, to make all humanity good and wise, is again promising what he cannot perform. It is indispensable that we should have good laws and upright and honest and fearless administration of the laws; and we are not to be excused if we fail to hold our public men to a rigid accountability if they fail, in their turn, to see that we have proper legislation and proper administration. No public man worth his salt will be other than glad to be held accountable in that fashion.","But important though the law is, though the administration of the law is, we can never escape having to face the fundamental truth that neither begins to be of the decisive importance that the average individual's character is. In the last analysis it is the man's own character which is and must ever be the determining factor in his success or failure in life , and therefore in the last analysis it is the average character of the average citizenship of a nation which will in the long run determine whether that nation is to go up or down.","The one indispensable thing for us to keep is a high standard of character for the average American citizen.","Now for my unrelated second thought, and that is to reiterate something that I said this morning. I had the very great pleasure of dedicating the monument to Dewey's fleet for its victory at Manila. We today were enjoying the aftermath of the triumph, due in part to what Dewey and his officers and men did on the first day of May, five years ago, and in even greater part to what those men did who in the past fifteen years had prepared for the winning of that triumph. I have very great confidence in the capacity of our average soldier or sailor to turn out well, to do admirably when put to the supreme test. But the best man alive, if untrained, if unfitly armed, may be beaten by a poorer man who has had the training and the arms. There is nothing more foolish, nothing less dignified than to indulge in boastfulness, in self-glorification as to the capacity of our soldiers and sailors while denying them the material which we are in honor bound to give them in order that their splendid natural qualities shall be fitly supplemented. [Cheers and applause] I have seen our people send American volunteers against a European soldiery, that , European soldiery armed with the finest type of modern rifle and ours with an old black-powder weapon, which was about as effective as a medieval cross bow; and those who failed to prepare the proper weapons for our people are not to be thanked, because by making drafts of an extraordinary kind upon the other good qualities of the American soldier, we escaped disaster.","And who were those who failed to prepare? It is very easy and worse than foolish, it is wicked, to hold the people who at the moment are obliged to use those weapons responsible when the real responsibility lay with the representatives of our people and our people themselves for failing to make the preparation in advance.","The business of finding a scapegoat to send loose into the wilderness is neither honorable nor dignified for a self-respecting people to be engaged in. We commemorated today by a monument a great naval victory. We commemorated thereby the foresight, the prudence of the public men, of the great business men, of the shipwrights, the men who worked physically at the armor, the guns, the engines, the hulls, in getting the fleet ready; and, more than that, we commemorated the men who trained that fleet in readiness. Many an officer who was retired before the Spanish War came is entitled to his full share of the credit for what was done in that war, although he never saw it, because he had done his part in actual sea service in training the men to handle the mighty and delicate weapons of war intrusted to their care.","Every public man who by his vote helped to make efficient that navy, every business man, every wage-worker, who did honest work on the ships, and every representative of the navy, officer or enlisted man, who in the years before the war faithfully did his duty aboard the ships in fitting crew and ship for the test of war, is entitled to a portion of the credit of the victory in Manila Bay.","So it is with the army. I believe—no, I am not going to boast, and so I am going to say a little less than I think—I shall shift the form of my sentence and say that I have entire confidence in the average officer and average enlisted man in the army of the United States (cheers and applause) if only he is given any kind of a fair chance, but give him good weapons, and give him a chance to handle them and to handle himself so as to be prepared for war. The best man alive, if he is given no chance to practice, cannot be expected when first put to a test to show his abilities at their best. Give us a chance to handle our men in masses in time of peace. Remember that if you scatter the army in fifties or hundreds all over the country, you must expect as inevitable, and as not in the least blameworthy on the part of the army, trouble, when you come to gather them together as an army and to send them into a foreign country.","Give our army a chance, or even half a chance, to practice in time of peace the performance of its proper function in time of war, and I can guarantee that the American people will ever in the future have the same cause that they have had in the past to be proud of the army and navy of the United States. "]}

As the recipient of an honorary degree in 1956 from Boston College, and therefore an instant alumnus, I am particularly pleased to be with all of you on this most felicitous occasion.","This university, or college, as Father Walsh has described, was founded in the darkest days of the Civil War, when this Nation was engaged in a climactic struggle to determine whether it would be half slave and half free or all free. And now, 100 years later, after the most intense century perhaps in human history, we are faced with the great question of whether this world will be half slave and half free, or whether it will be all one or the other. And on this occasion, as in 1863, the services of Boston College are still greatly needed.","It is good also to participate in this ceremony which has honored three distinguished citizens of the free world--President Pusey, Father Bunn, and our friend from the world of freedom, Lady Jackson.","Boston College is a hundred years old-old by the life span of men, but young by that of universities. In this week of observance, you have rightly celebrated the achievements of the past, and equally rightly you have turned in a series of discussions by outstanding scholars to the problems of the present and the future. Learned men have been talking here of the knowledge explosion, and in all that they have said I am sure they have implied the heavy present responsibility of institutions like this one. Yet today I want to say a word on the same theme, to impress upon you as urgently as I can the growing and insistent importance of universities in our national life.","I speak of universities because that is what Boston College has long since become. But most of what I say applies to liberal arts colleges as well. My theme is not limited to any one class of universities, public or private, religious or secular. Our national tradition of variety in higher education shows no sign of weakening, and it remains the task of each of our institutions to shape its own role among its differing sisters.","In this hope I am much encouraged by a reading in this last week of the remarkable encyclical, \"Pacem in Terris.\" In its penetrating analysis of today's great problems, of social welfare and human rights, of disarmament and international order and peace, that document surely shows that on the basis of one great faith and its traditions there can be developed counsel on public affairs that is of value to all men and women of good will. As a Catholic I am proud of it; and as an American I have learned from it. It only adds to the impact of this message that it closely matches notable expressions of conviction and aspiration from churchmen of other faiths, as in recent documents of the World Council of Churches, and from outstanding world citizens with no ecclesiastical standing. We are learning to talk the language of progress and peace across the barriers of sect and creed. It seems reasonable to hope that a similar process may be taking place across the quite different barriers of higher learning.","From the office that I hold, in any case, there can be no doubt today of the growing meaning of universities in America. That, of course, is one basic reason for the increasing urgency with which those who care most for the progress of our society are pressing for more adequate programs in higher education and in education generally. It is for this reason that I urge upon everyone here and in this country the pressing need for national attention and a national decision in the national interest upon the national question of education. In at least four ways, the new realities of our day have combined to intensify the focal role of the university in our Nation's life.","First, and perhaps most obvious, the whole world has come to our doorstep and the universities must be its student. In the strange geometry of modern politics, the distant Congo can be as close to us as Canada, and Canada, itself, is worth more attention than we have sometimes given. Cultures not our own press for understanding. Crises we did not create require our participation. Accelerating change is the one universal human prospect. The universities must help.","Second, there is indeed an explosion of knowledge and its outward limits are not yet in sight. In some fields, progress seems very fast; in others, distressingly slow. It is no tribute to modern science to jump lightly to the conclusion that all its secrets of particle physics, of molecular life, of heredity, of outer space, are now within easy reach. The truth is more massive and less magical. It is that wherever we turn, in defense, in space, in medicine, in industry, in agriculture, and most of all in basic science, itself, the requirement is for better work, deeper understanding, higher education. And while I have framed this comment in the terms of the natural sciences, I insist, as do all those who live in this field, that at every level of learning there must be an equal concern for history, for letters and the arts, and for man as a social being in the widest meaning of Aristotle's phrase. This also is the work of the university.","And third, as the world presses in and knowledge presses out, the role of the interpreter grows. Men can no longer know everything themselves; the 20th century has no universal man. All men today must learn to know through one another--to judge across their own ignorance--to comprehend at second hand. These arts are not easily learned. Those who would practice them must develop intensity of perception, variety of mental activity, and the habit of open concern for truth in all its forms. Where can we expect to find a training ground for this modern maturity, if not in our universities?","Fourth and finally, these new requirements strengthen still further what has always been a fundamental element in the life of American colleges and universities--that they should be dedicated to \"the Nation's service.\" The phrase is Woodrow Wilson's, and no one has discussed its meaning better. What he said in 1896 is more relevant today than ever before, and I close with a quotation from him.","I offer it to you with renewed congratulations, and in the confident hope that as the second century opens, Boston College will continue to respond--as she did in her beginnings-to the new needs of the age.","\"It is not learning,\" said President Wilson, \"but the spirit of service that will give a college place in the public annals of the Nation.\" \"It is indispensable,\" he said, \"if it is to do its right service, that the air of affairs should be admitted to all its classrooms... the air of the world's transactions, the consciousness of the solidarity of the race, the sense of the duty of man toward man the promise and the hope that shine in the face of all knowledge .... The days of glad expansion are gone, our life grows tense and difficult; our resource for the future lies in careful thought, providence, and a wise economy; and the school must be of the Nation.\"","Boston College for too years has been of the Nation and so it will be for the next hundred.","Thank you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthededicationmcnarydamwallawallawashington","text":["y address, I wonder if you would mind if I would communicate to you an odd thought that occurred to me, as I sat here. There was brought to me in emphatic form once, by an old soldier of mine, who reminded me that you could never tell what was around the corner in the world. When I first came back from Europe 2 years ago, and before my friends found that it was utterly futile and useless to try to make me appear better on the TV by the use of paints and stains, they had me in a little room one night, and the man was working very seriously on my face in an effort to do something about it. Finally, in this very preoccupied sort of job and atmosphere that was prevailing, he suddenly began to laugh. And he said to me, \"General, we have got ourselves in a funny fix.\" He said, \"Here you are, an old General, trying to turn politician.\" And he said, \"I am a beautician. Do you know what I was in the war?\" said, \"No.\" He said, \"I was one of your paratroopers.\"","What made me think of that this morning was the fact that when I first met Sam Sturgis, I was detailed as a young officer to coach a football team and I made him an end, and he worked pretty hard under me for some weeks and months.","Today, I think that all of you would like for me to speak for you in commending him as a brilliant head of a great organization which not only here but throughout our land has built up these great works in flood control, in drainage, in water conservation, and power development-an organization of which not only the United States Army but which America is proud.","My friends, to join you in so important a ceremony--here in the heart of the Pacific Northwest--is indeed a privilege. I am delighted to be here with you on this historic spot.","Our Nation was only 16 years old when, from a point near here, two Americans of great courage--Lewis and Clark--pushed off and floated to the mouth of this great river.","A little over a century ago, a man named McKay struggled over primitive paths in this area. A hundred and nine years ago., a frontiersman named McNary, with his family, reached this almost virgin land to establish his home.","Both of these men had famous descendants--men who have contributed much to the extraordinary growth of the Northwest.","From the McKay family came an able Governor and a dedicated Secretary of the Interior--Douglas McKay.","From the McNarys came the great American whose name forevermore will distinguish this monumental work.","Senator McNary believed deeply in the future of this country. He had the grit and determination to help build that future. In this endeavor he worked side by side with those men of vision of this region who, before the turn of the century, sought to open to navigation the upper reaches of the Columbia River. With that drive for an open river for water traffic came the natural development of hydro-electric power.","Ten years ago, death denied Senator McNary the privilege of seeing his dream come true. But the will to build this dam lived after him.","And may I pause to pay my personal tribute to Mrs. McNary, here with us today on the platform. That the will to build this dam survived-and that today this dam is built--are due to the spirit of distinguished citizens of this region. Especially are they due to an Oregonian who carried on Senator McNary's work and for the past 10 years has labored tirelessly to complete this project--my good friend, Senator Guy Cordon.","I am mindful as well of the sustained effort of many Congressmen from this region, including particularly Congressman Hal Holmes, who have worked in behalf of this and other great projects here in the Northwest.","Now, this massive dam, my friends, means much more than the steel and concrete, more than the genius and the effort that went into its building. It means more than the benefits and the progress--however great--that it will bring to this fortunate region.","This structure symbolizes the purpose of using, for the benefit of all our people, the tremendous natural legacy with which the Almighty so abundantly endowed our land. Wisely and providently we must use and develop these resources, so that each succeeding generation of Americans may share in their benefits. It is for us to see that they shall not be wasted or neglected or denied to generations yet to come.","Now, among these treasures of our land is water fast becoming our most valuable, most prized, most critical resource. A blessing when properly used--it can bring devastation and ruin when left uncontrolled.","It is essential that every drop of water, from the moment that it falls upon our land, be turned to the service of our people. Thus we will save our soil and make it more productive: thus we will develop power, prevent floods, improve navigation, and supply our tremendous and growing domestic and industrial needs for water. So crucial to our future has water become, that I have assigned appropriate surveys and plans concerning it to a special committee of the Cabinet, and to the Hoover Commission as well. These studies, when subjected to Congressional action, will undoubtedly result in the comprehensive water policy that this country has needed since its very beginning.","The wise control of our water resources obviously requires the most skillful and comprehensive planning. This dam, for example, is designed to operate in coordination with similar structures, upstream and down. It is part of a plan to assure the full use of the water resources of this entire river system. McNary Dam is, therefore, representative of the coordination that must mark the development of all of our river systems. It is, moreover, an example of national responsibility properly assumed by the Federal Government.","Just a mile and a half down river is another structure--the bridge at Umatilla. I am sure that you who live here are just as proud of that bridge as you are of this tremendous dam. You have every right to be. That bridge at Umatilla is an example of local responsibility properly assumed.","A major difference between the two undertakings is in size. All of you know that when construction was started on McNary Dam, no local enterprise--public or private--could have financed it, so, realizing that the dam was necessary, the Federal Government gave its support.","The bridge at Umatilla was a much smaller effort. Local enterprise-in this case the county government--was able to shoulder the $5 million loan that made that construction possible. And so, local enterprise did that job.","These two structures illustrate an idea we have been applying in Washington for some 19 months. It is not a new concept. A century ago Abraham Lincoln put it better than anyone else has done. He said, \"The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves--in their separate and individual capacities.\"","Now, in keeping with Lincoln's standard, the Federal Government has certain vital responsibilities in such fields relating to the control and use of water as flood control, improvement of navigation, and reclamation and development of land. When in the course of assuming these responsibilities, dams are built, then hydro-electric power is often developed, of great value to the surrounding regions and to the Nation.","I hope that we shall soon have another example of Federal responsibility in the generation of power. I refer to the Libby Dam, which-like this great McNary Dam--is a project requiring the resources of the Federal Government. From its location on the Canadian border, on a tributary of this mighty Columbia River, it will powerfully aid the control of floods, and produce a new means of generating power, all the way to the sea.","I have recently acted to remove obstacles to the construction of that dam. A new site has been selected. A distinguished northwesterner, Governor Jordan of Idaho, has been named Chairman of the International Joint Commission. His intimate knowledge of this area and sound judgment will surely go far to speed fulfillment of our aims, and those of our Canadian neighbors. This project will be brought into existence.","I shall continue to recommend Federal construction of such beneficial projects. New ones will be started.","Such activities as these, my friends, are obviously, as Lincoln said, \"the legitimate object of government.\" But here let us draw our line as he himself did, when he went on to say this: \"In all that the people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere.\"","It is not properly a Federal responsibility to try to supply all the power needs of our people. The Federal Government should no more attempt to do so than it should assume responsibility for supplying all their drinking water, their food, their housing, and their transportation.","To attempt such a centralization of authority and responsibility always starts a deadly cycle.","Parenthetically, may I remark that a region which lets itself become completely dependent upon national funds provided by a Congress-which Congress represents not that region alone but the whole Nation-would frequently find that the funds fail to keep pace with local needs. But the important thing is that as Federal power expands in a region-and I mean Federal authority and responsibility--local enterprise comes increasingly intimidated and discouraged, even though the needs for energy continue to grow. Thus still more Federal intervention becomes necessary. Such a conversion of local regions into Federal satellites poses a threat deadly to our liberties. The Administration in Washington--and the present leadership in Congress--are unalterably opposed to such malignant growth of bureaucracy.","In our devotion to conservation, let us not forget that there are spiritual as well as physical values to protect. Above all else, we must protect the freedom and the spirit of independence of our people in our States and counties, in our cities and towns. Determination to have this kind of freedom gave us this Nation. It brought your ancestors to this Western country. That determination is not only the surest protector of our liberties, it is the principal ingredient in our national prosperity.","Yet, there are some who contend that the development and distribution of hydro-electric power is exclusively the responsibility of the Federal Government. They argue that to permit any State or local government or any private company under governmental regulation to develop such power capacity is to give to a special group an asset belonging to all the Nation. Indeed, in some instances, these disciples of centralized responsibility and authority insist that since the Federal Government should provide all hydro-electric power, it should likewise eliminate competition by providing steam-electric power as well.","Only thus, these zealots would have us believe, can we poor citizens be protected against exploitation against what they call the \"predatory\" exponents of capitalism--that is, free enterprise.","Now, let's have a quick look at this matter.","In the first place it is, of course, not difficult to be generous with someone else's money. So the individual who wants to build power dams only with Federal money is not directly or particularly concerned with the economic necessity of the project or with the suitability of its location. Secondly, these advocates of centralized government shut their eyes to the remarkable development of this Nation during past decades. They must wonder how such prosperity came about when communities and citizens were free to look after themselves--including their own protection against the so-called local \"interests.\"","These believers in centralization fail to warn us that monopoly is always potentially dangerous to freedom--even when monopoly is exercised by the Government. Curiously enough, they proclaim their fear of a private power monopoly in a county, city or State, but they urge upon us all a gigantic, overwhelming, nationwide power monopoly. But, of course, they also see themselves as the all-wise directors of that monopoly-so all would be well. monopoly, nor do they want a system leading toward it. They know","The American people do not want and do not need to have any such they can have all the power capacity of our streams developed, as needed, without forfeiting the advantages of local responsibility and participation.","Throughout our country are many public enterprises--organized years ago by States, municipalities, and other public agencies--which have long been in successful operation. In hundreds of other instances, power has been and is being provided by private enterprise under the regulatory processes in the particular governmental agency involved. In each instance the people directly concerned by such operations have themselves decided whether they are best served by public or by private agencies.","The issue is not, therefore, public power versus unregulated private power. The issue posed to us is Federal monopoly of power, as against public or regulated power, freely chosen in each instance by the citizens of each area, with the Federal Government coming in as a cooperating partner where this seems necessary or desirable.","Last year, for example, State and local governments were invited to cooperate in power generation without the threat of Federal power control. During this brief period numerous local public agencies and private investors have applied for licenses to build hydro-electric plants. These applications in this Northwest region amount to nearly six million kilowatts. This represents a prospective investment of not less than one and one-half billion dollars. Well over half of this would be invested by public power--not private power--interests.","But the seekers after Federal control of energy are not silenced even by this array of facts. They say that construction of power projects by local enterprise will impede the comprehensive development of this or other river basins.","Now again--let's take a look at the facts.","What they say just is not true. All power projects must be licensed by the Federal Power Commission. Before the Commission grants a license, it must see evidence that the project makes maximum use of the developed resources. It makes no difference who builds the projects-Federal, State, municipal, or private agencies. These requirements apply--regardless.","We should also get this straight: when a project is licensed before a non-Federal authority, it is not removed from public control. Rates and services remain under regulation. And when the licensing period ends, the site can be assumed by the Federal Government.","I happen to hold this conviction: that, here in the Northwest, your own public agencies and your own private companies--operating under both Federal regulation and your own eagle eyes out here--can work in the public interest at least as well as some far-off Federal agency. They ought to do better.","At this moment there are glowing reports on your regional efforts to work out your own problems. Through the Governors' Power Policy Committee, Governors Langlie, Patterson, Jordan, and Aronson are doing great work in assuring this area of adequate supplies of water. More benefits will flow from efforts to further inter-State cooperation on problems that cross the borders of the Northwestern States.","I am especially happy that the power produced by this great new dam will contribute to the finest type of cooperative effort--your own Northwest Power Pool. This arrangement is an admirable modal of voluntary pooling of public and private generating and transmission facilities. Because of it, you citizens of the Northwest have hundreds of thousands of kilowatts of additional prime power that would not exist through independent operation of your various utilities. And in addition--and very important--you have it under your own control--not under the permission of a far-off Washington office holder. This is a splendid partnership--the kind that the Administration will continue to encourage. I might add that this partnership concept has been most ably advanced by your Republican delegation in the Congress, led by Senator Cordon.","My friends, in all of these things that I have mentioned, your goal and the goal of your Government are exactly the same: to assure each citizen of enough kilowatts, when he wants them, where he wants them, at the lowest competitive cost--with the least likelihood of bureaucratic domination from Washington, D.C.","In this effort, we shall avoid extremes. We shall neither withdraw from the power field nor will we federalize all electric power generators in the United States. Instead, we shall continue to advance in a spirit of helpfulness to localities, and in a spirit of cooperation with local citizens.","Where local enterprise can shoulder the burden, it will be encouraged and supported in doing so.","And where local action cannot or should not fully meet the need, we shall have Federal action.","In this way, our people, in their communities and homes throughout America, shall reserve to themselves as many of the basic decisions affecting their lives as possible. In this way, our people will remain free to carve out their destinies as their predecessors did. It was in this spirit that those who preceded you in the great Northwest, in only a century and a half, turned an unsettled wilderness into an inland empire--an empire vastly enriched by this gigantic structure which today we so proudly name the McNary Dam.","Now, my friends, I know that the policy I have outlined for you will satisfy neither group that exists at the extreme ends of this argument. It is not intended to please them. This program, as all other programs in which your Government engages, is designed to benefit the United States of America--160 million people. It is guided and formulated on the advice, the commonsense counsel of the vast majority of Americans. Extremes do not interest me, or the Administration, in the slightest.","Fellow citizens, we have talked today especially of power and water and this great new dam. But it is well that we remind ourselves that these are but part of a commonly-held objective which transcends all partisan and sectional considerations. The objective is that this Republic shall in every way grow ever stronger and more secure--that it may remain at peace in a world freed of the threat of atomic war. We want our America to have an ever growing, vigorous economy. We want every citizen to prosper and advance--with freedoms which daily shine brighter in each community of our land. We shall continue to build the material, moral, and intellectual strength to assure ourselves and our children of an always finer tomorrow.","Toward that stronger and better America, my friends, I know that you will continue to go forward, as self-reliant, courageous descendants of God-fearing pioneers, fortified by your faith in yourselves and in your country.","As you travel that wonderful road, I trust that you will have full confidence, every step of the way, that your Federal Government strides beside you as your true partner. May you always be sure that this Administration is ready to help where necessary, eager as your servant to make the way easier for you and for all. But it will never be willing to assume over you a domination that will rob you of your greatest heritage--your individual liberty and your maximum control over your personal, family and local concerns.","That, my friends, is the kind of government, the kind of America, of which your children and mine will be as proud as we are of our country today.","And now, of course, without a pushbutton, no dedication is possible. General Sturgis has explained to you the workings of this instrument-what will happen about the lights and the sounds--about what will happen in sending an electric current to some machinery--about the lights going on--and then this great and inspiring marvel, the McNary Dam--another portion of it, will be furnishing power to the Northwest Power Pool.","It is with the greatest sense of distinction and pride in the Federal Government's part of what was done in this project that I now, by this act, officially dedicate this McNary Dam.","Thank you very much, my friends--thank you."]}

This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America.","Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam. Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just must be the center of our concerns.","But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people. This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home.","And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight.","I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year.","I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty.","I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth.","I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.","I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America.","I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins.","I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system from prevention to probation.","I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing.","I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the Federal Government by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies. In turn, I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both required as well as rewarded.","I will ask you to make it possible for Members of the House of Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the Nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to 4 years, concurrent with that of the [SPEAKER].","II.","Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it.","We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society.","Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion.","Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years. It will be only $1.8 billion next year. Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion. Revenues next year will be $111 billion.","On a cash basis which is the way that you and I keep our family budget the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967.","I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures. I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans.","There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask them: Who will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?","Time may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make them.","But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty.","I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam. But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need.","And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber.","III.","The Great Society leads us along three roads growth and justice and liberation.","[1.] First is growth the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress.","I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already in every city and countryside. This Nation is flourishing.","Workers are making more money than ever with after-tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.","More people are working than ever before in our history an increase last year of 2 1/2 million jobs.","Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent.","Average farm income is higher than ever. Over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone.","I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3 billion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government.","We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year.","And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight.","I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago. Without raising taxes or even increasing the total tax bill paid we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date.","I hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.","[2.] The second road is justice. Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin.","I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements.","I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime.","Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the Federal Government, to 'prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.","For that other nation within a Nation the poor whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience.","To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources.","For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures.","And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest.","[3.] The third path is the path of liberation. It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives. A great nation is one which breeds a great people. A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius. That alone is a Great Society.","Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome.","We can subdue and we can master these forces bring increased meaning to our lives if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people.","This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.","Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces.","I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia.","In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people. Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life.","I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas.","Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air.","We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people.","To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces.","Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets and that right just must be secured.","Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways.","I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy.","We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.","It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention. We must change to master change.","I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch, to modernize the relations between city and State and Nation.","A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities. The present structure 35 Government agencies, spending $5 billion yearly makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great Nation or the needs of the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality.","I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound in excess of 2,000 miles per hour.","I propose to examine our Federal system-the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people.","As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors.","Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and State committees under the act to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions-and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice.","To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives-which should not begin before 1972.","The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom. Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life. The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the House. And I urge your swift action.","IV.","Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam. That conflict is not an isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War II.","The touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States the welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States. But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass.","In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster.","An America that is mighty beyond description-yet living in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man.","In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin.","In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world.","And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice.","In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression in Korea under President Truman in the Formosa Straits under President  Eisenhower in Cuba under President Kennedy and again in Vietnam.","Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents.","[1.] The first principle is strength. Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments. We will need expenditures of $58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might.","While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by only $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of Government.","[2.] A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction.","We will vigorously pursue existing proposals-and seek new ones to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.","[3.] A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world.","By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world.","We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for Progress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme association the United Nations.","We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to trade, and to improve international finance.","[4.] A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man.","From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.","This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves.","We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance.","We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture.","We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966.","I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research and we will earmark funds to help their efforts.","In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world.","[5.] The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institutions.","For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself.","We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule.","We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another.","We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe. And I will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West.","The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today's world in which we live.","In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will.","It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire.","In recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China.","History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system or belief unless force is used to make it so.","That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba-and tonight in Vietnam.","For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young Americans die in a distant land.","Tonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom.","How many times in my lifetime and in yours have the American people gathered, as they do now, to hear their [SPEAKER] tell them of conflict and tell them of danger?","Each time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this Nation required.","And they do again tonight in Vietnam. Not too many years ago Vietnam was a peaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist government. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States.","There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people. But their progress was slight. Their hope of success was dim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest. And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression.","As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We stayed.","And we will stay until aggression has stopped.","We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American [SPEAKER]s.","We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection. To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in one land, and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists.","And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest.","Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again. Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South. Attack and terror increased, spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near.","Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to make our firmness clear to the North. Thus. we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam. We increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men.","These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success. The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of Americans and their allies and by the enduring courage of the South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men last year for every one of ours.","The enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side. There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.","Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace.","In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with friends and adversaries throughout the world.","Since Christmas your Government has labored again, with imagination and endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement. For 20 days now we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam.","Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more than 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all 113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't. We have talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.","In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to friends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and throughout this hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly clear.","We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self-determination that the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear.","The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification.","This is all we want for South Vietnam. It is all the people of South Vietnam want. And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard.","We have also made it clear from Hanoi to New York that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any proposals four points or fourteen or forty and we will consider the views of any group. We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have begun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future.","We have said all this, and we have asked-and hoped and we have waited for a response.","So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure.","We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes.","We have found understanding and support. And we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace.","I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future may require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once.","Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.","But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every dollar, and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge.","And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war.","And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle.","There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will. But for others it must now be clear the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose.","The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny. For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.","It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death.","To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight: Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the servant of life.","In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve.","V.","This is the State of the Union.","But over it all wealth, and promise, and expectation lies our troubling awareness of American men at war tonight.","How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other wars? How very many are not here to listen?","The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars. Yet, finally, war is always the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise. It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate.","Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world.","Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me. But there is a difference. For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire. For we have children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed. There are poor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a world to be helped.","Yet we do what we must.","I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires.","Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble. I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk. And from that belief your [SPEAKER] summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come.","The work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth. Thank you, and goodnight. "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentscharlestonsouthcarolinaremarksthe31stannualmeetingthesouthernlegislative","text":["Senator Hollings and Senator Eastland, Senator Stennis, Governor Edwards, Chairman Bragg, distinguished Members of Congress, those representatives from State government, who share the leadership of America, and my friends in a personal way who come out to welcome me back to the South:","It's not often that a President comes as a substitute speaker. I realize that my brother, Billy, was the first choice. [Laughter] I understand that the Southern Legislative Conference--[laughter]couldn't afford Billy here.","I was going to go by Plains on this trip, but I couldn't get a room there. [Laughter] I'm going to go to Yazoo City tonight and then to New Orleans later on.","I'm very grateful to be here as President of our country. I've learned a lot in this first 6 months. When I got to Washington and sought advice, someone said, \"Just act like you're a President and treat Congress like the Georgia Legislature.\" It didn't work at first. [Laughter]","Very quickly I realized that the Congress was treating me like I was still Governor of Georgia, but now, with the help of a great number of friends in the Congress, we've formed a kind of relationship that ought to exist between the White House and our Nation's Capitol. I think there's a genuine sense of sharing of responsibility and the burden of government, and you are a part of that circle of leaders in the State legislature and the Governors' offices, who join in with the President, the Congress, and others in making sure that our government works.","I've become even more proud of being an American. And I have become even more proud of being a southerner, too. I'm also proud to be with you today where two great rivers come together, as they say in Charleston, to form the Atlantic Ocean. This is one of our Nation's most gracious cities.","And I want to talk to you today about the hopes and problems that we as southerners and as Americans share together. I feel a special kinship with your State legislators. For 4 years I was a member of the Georgia Senate, and I still prize State government not only for the talents of those who work in it but, as Fritz Hollings says, for the closeness to the people it represents.","Our Southern States have a proud tradition of local, independent government, and now you're the heirs of that tradition. But we in the South have also felt, perhaps more directly than many others, some of the rapid changes that have taken place in this modern age. More and more our own lives are shaped by events in other cities, decisions in other States, tensions in other parts of the world.","And as Americans we cannot overlook the way that our fate is bound to that of other nations. This interdependence stretches from the health of our economy, through war and peace, to the security of our own energy supplies. It's a new world in which we cannot afford to be narrow in our vision, limited in our foresight, or selfish in our purpose.","When I took office almost exactly 6 months ago, our Nation was faced with a series of problems around the world--in southern Africa, the Middle East, in our relationships with our NATO allies, and on such tough questions as nuclear proliferation, negotiations with our former adversaries, a Panama Canal treaty, human rights, world poverty.","We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and controversial issues--some of which had been either skirted or postponed in the past.","As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate, disagreement, probing was inevitable. Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and lasting.","Now, a President has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure as President making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you and understood and debated by the Congress.","In the past I think our Nation's leaders have been guilty of making decisions in secret. And even when the decision turns out to be the fight one, it makes the President, the Secretary of State speak with a weak voice when they speak alone.","Today, I want to discuss a vitally important aspect of our foreign relations, the one that may most directly shape the chances for peace for us and for our children. I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and where we are going in our relations with the Soviet Union and to reaffirm the basic principles of our national policy.","I don't have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the American people.","For decades, the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the other headed by the Soviet Union.","Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern us both.","Even if we succeed in relaxing tensions with the U.S.S.R., we could still awake one day to find that nuclear weapons have been spread to dozens of other nations who may not be as responsible as are we. Or we could struggle to limit the conventional arsenals of our two nations, to reduce the danger of war, only to undo our efforts by continuing without constraint to export armaments around the world.","As two industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises. Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas.","Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of international relations.","Europe and Japan rose from the rubble of war to become great economic powers. Communist parties and governments have become more widespread and more varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant.","Both the United States and the Soviet Union have learned that our countries and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We've learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either one or two super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity.","I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think that to understand today's Soviet-American relationship, we must place it in perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene.","The whole history of Soviet-American relations teaches us that we will be misled if we base our long-range policies on the mood of the moment, whether that mood be euphoric or grim. All of us can remember times when relations seemed especially dangerous and other times when they seemed especially bright.","We've crossed those peaks and valleys before. And we can see that, on balance, the trend in the last third of a century has been positive.","The profound differences in what our two governments believe about freedom and power and the inner lives of human beings, those differences are likely to remain; and so are other elements of competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. That competition is real and deeply rooted in the history and the values of our respective societies. But it's also true that our two countries share many important overlapping interests. Our job---my job, your job--is to explore those shared interests and use them to enlarge the areas of cooperation between us on a basis of equality and mutual respect.","As we negotiate with the Soviet Union, we will be guided by a vision of a gentler, freer, and more bountiful world. But we will have no illusions about the nature of the world as it really is. The basis for complete mutual trust between us does not yet exist. Therefore, the agreements that we reach must be anchored on each side in enlightened self-interest-what's best for us, what's best for the Soviet Union. That's why we search for areas of agreement where our real interests and those of the Soviets coincide.","We want to see the Soviets further engaged in the growing pattern of international activities designed to deal with human problems--not only because they can be of real help but because we both should be seeking for a greater stake in the creation of a constructive and peaceful world order.","When I took office, many Americans were growing disillusioned with detente---President Ford had even quit using the word, and by extension, people were concerned with the whole course of our relations with the Soviet Union. Also, and perhaps more seriously, world respect for the essential rightness of American foreign policy had been shaken by the events of a decade---Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate. At the same time, we were beginning to regain our sense of confidence and our purpose and unity as a nation.","In this situation, I decided that it was time for honest discussions about international issues with the American people. I felt that it was urgent to restore the moral bearings of American foreign policy. And I felt that it was important to put the U.S. and Soviet relationship, in particular, on a more reciprocal, realistic, and, ultimately, more productive basis for both nations.","It's not a question of a \"hard\" policy or of a \"soft\" policy, but of a clear-eyed recognition of how most effectively to protect our own security and to create the kind of international order that I've just described. This is our goal.","We've looked at the problems in Soviet-American relations in a fresh way, and we've sought to deal with them boldly and constructively with proposals intended to produce concrete results. I'd like to point out just a few of them.","In the talks on strategic arms limitations, the SALT talks, we advanced a comprehensive proposal for genuine reductions, limitations, and a freeze on new technology which would maintain balanced strategic strength.","We have urged a complete end to all nuclear tests, and these negotiations are now underway. Agreement here could be a milestone in U.S.-Soviet relations.","We're working together toward a ban on chemical and biological warfare and the elimination of inventories of these destructive materials. We have proposed to curb the sales and transfers of conventional weapons to other countries, and we've asked France, Britain, and other countries to join with us in this effort.","We are attempting to halt the threatening proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which don't yet have the ability to set off nuclear explosives.","We've undertaken serious negotiations on arms limitations in the Indian Ocean. We've encouraged the Soviets to sign, along with us, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which would ban the introduction of nuclear weapons into the southern part of the Western Hemisphere.","We have begun regular consultations with the Soviet leaders as cochairmen of the prospective Geneva conference to promote peace in the Middle East.","We and our allies are negotiating together with the Soviet Union and their allies in the Warsaw Pact nations to reduce the level of military forces in Europe.","We've renewed the 1972 agreement for cooperation in science and technology, and a similar agreement for cooperation in outer space.","We're seeking ways to cooperate in improving world health and in relieving world hunger.","In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the basic strategic balance.","We've outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now exists.","The Vladivostok negotiations of 1974 left some issues unresolved and subject to honest differences of interpretation. Meanwhile, new developments in technology have created new concerns--the cruise missile, the very large intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Soviets.","The Soviets are worried about our cruise missiles, and we are concerned about the security of our own deterrent capability. Our cruise missiles are aimed at compensating for the growing threat to our deterrent, represented by the buildup of strategic Soviet offensive weapons forces. If these threats can be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be no doubt that the United States can and will do what it must to protect our security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture.","Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements that will not be overturned by the next technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word, for genuine accommodation.","But none of these proposals that I've outlined to you involves a sacrifice of security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our view is that a SALT agreement which just reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in SALT will not merely stabilize competition in weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations as well.","When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I'm not speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own individual citizens, Soviet and American, that comes from the knowledge which all of you have that the leaders of our two countries have the capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we make the world a safer place but we'll also free ourselves to concentrate on constructive action to give the world a better life.","We've made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some negative comments from the Soviet side about SALT and about our more general relations. If these comments are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our efforts to make our motives clear; but if the Soviets are merely making comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us, let no one doubt that we will persevere.","What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we hope the Soviets will do the same. Together we can give this change a positive direction.","Increased trade between the United States and the Soviet Union would help us both. The American-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission has resumed its meetings after a long interlude. I hope that conditions can be created that will make possible steps toward expanded trade.","In southern Africa we have pressed for Soviet and Cuban restraint. Throughout the nonaligned world, our goal is not to encourage dissension or to redivide the world into opposing ideological camps, but to expand the realm of independent, economically self-reliant nations, and to oppose attempts at new kinds of subjugation.","Part of the Soviet Union leaders' current attitude may be due to their apparent-and incorrect--belief that our concern for human rights is aimed specifically at them or is an attack on their vital interests.","There are no hidden meanings in our commitment to human rights.","We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. Our policy is exactly what it appears to be: the positive and sincere expression of our deepest beliefs as a people. It's addressed not to any particular people or area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own country.","And it's specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the cold war.","On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our own country this last century has proved this over and over again.","We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations of the world. We're going to do that.","In the past 6 months we've made clear our determination--both to give voice to Americans' fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our choice.","We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship will evolve in a more constructive direction.","I cannot forecast whether all our efforts will succeed. But there are things which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very briefly.","This place where I now stand is one of the oldest cities in the United States. It's a beautiful town of whose culture and urban charm all Americans are proud--just as the people of the Soviet Union are justly proud of such ancient cities as Tbilisi or Novgorod, which there they lovingly preserve, as you do in Charleston, and into which they infuse a new life that makes these cities far more than just dead remnants of a glorious historical past.","Although there are deep differences in our values and ideas, we Americans and Russians belong to the same civilization whose origins stretch back hundreds of years.","Beyond all the disagreements between us--and beyond the cool calculations of mutual self-interest that our two countries bring to the negotiating table--is the invisible human reality that must bring us closer together. I mean the yearning for peace, real peace, that is in the very bones of us all.","I'm absolutely certain that the people of the Soviet Union, who have suffered so grievously in war, feel this yearning for peace. And in this they are at one with the people of the United States. It's up to all of us to help make that unspoken passion into something more than just a dream. And that responsibility falls most heavily on those like you, of course, but particularly like President Brezhnev and me, who hold in our hands the terrible power conferred on us by the modern engines of war.","Mr. Brezhnev said something very interesting recently, and I quote from his speech: \"It is our belief, our firm belief,\" he said, \"that realism in politics and the will for detente and progress will ultimately triumph, and mankind will be able to step into the 21st century in conditions of peace, stable as never before.\"","I see no hidden meaning in that. I credit its sincerity. And I express the same hope and belief that Mr. Brezhnev expressed. With all the difficulties, all the conflicts, I believe that our planet must finally obey the Biblical injunction to \"follow after the things which make for peace.\"Thank you very much."]}

Those who go I shall see up there. Those who stay in Washington I shall not of course see, and I wish to take this opportunity to express my amazement at the constant correctness of my views as you report them to the country. It is very seldom that any error creeps in. I don't know how that could be done. I wouldn't be able to report as correctly the views of any one of you. I don't know how you get before the country so clearly and so well my views as you do. And I also want to thank you for the consideration with which you have always treated the Presidential office during the time that I have been President. It has been very helpful to me in the transaction of the public business and I think very helpful to the country in coming to a comprehension of what the Government is trying to do, how it is trying to function, what efforts it is making to benefit the condition of the people. I hope those of you that stay here or go to some other part of the country will have the opportunity to have as pleasant a summer as I expect to have and as those who go with me I know will have.","I would like to say also that I am very much gratified with the work that the Congress did. There was a very large amount of constructive legislation. The principal thing that will affect the country is the reduction of taxation. I wasn't able to do a great lot with the reduc-tion of expenditures, but we did keep expenditures down fairly well. There was no bill of general importance that passed that I did not approve. There were three or four small things. I sent up a couple of veto messages of personal and local significance and there were three or four bills that I decided not to sign. One of them I hadn't been able to make up my mind about it. That is the bill relative to taxation of lands in Oregon and Washington. That didn't come in until just as I was about to leave the office to go to lunch and from lunch to the Capitol, so I didn't have a chance to investigate it. I am investigating it now to see whether I ought to approve it or leave it disapproved. The tax measure I would say was the most important piece of legislation. The approval of the World Court and the manifest desire to place that on a basis where its independence would be made more secure than it is now, leaving the other nations to approve that policy, is a matter of importance in international relations. I think that there wasn't much of anything in the way of treaties. The Lausanne treaty and the treaty relative to the sale of arms and the use of gas didn't come up for final consideration. The Railroad Labor Bill will we hope develop into a very important policy, because of the significance of it of leaving the management of the railroads and the employees to agree among themselves with the very manifest disposition of a new desire on their part to harmonize difficulties that may arise and adjust them without the interference of the Government. And of course there is the building law which really represented a new policy of making a lump sum appropriation and leaving the administration of it and the disposition of it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I also believe the Postmaster General comes in on things that are of interest to the Post Office Department. Then the aviation bill was very important, which also is the adoption of a new policy of administration. With the great amount of discussion that had been going on through the summer months in relation to the aviation situation, the present bill is in a very wonderful way, I think, almost in entire harmony with the recommendations made by the Navy Air Board, a considerable step in advance. There are some things that remain to be done. We passed a bill that had been agreed upon in the fall as a result of conferences between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Cooperative Farm Associations that is of considerable importance for the betterment of the cooperative farm movement in the country. There are some things that have been left undone. Muscle Shoals hasn't been finally determined. I spoke of the two treaties. Coal legislation hasn't been finally passed upon. And legislation for the consolidation of railroads. Another matter of importance which awaits future action is legislation relative to the licensing of radio plants. I think those are the principal features of this Congress. But the fact remains that no legislation of general import was passed that didn't have my approval and in all the main features that I desired to have the Congress act upon I secured favorable action. I don't want to make the personal pronoun there too large. I happened to express it in that way. I think some of the success of the present Congress was due to the fact that they assumed very largely their own responsibility and undertook to function as an independent legislative body without too much interference on the part of the Executive or too much subservience to the wishes of the Executive. That is I mean, trying to determine questions on their merits. As a result of that policy there was very little of partisanship that was shown in the decision of any large questions. There is another item that I left out, which of course is of tremendous importance, and that is the settlement of our foreign debts. I would place that as one of the major accomplishments of the","last Congress. I didn't make any memo, and I presume that after you are away several others will occur to me of important achievements. You have my consent to put those in, if any of you think of them."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsfiresidechat15","text":["Five months have gone by since I last spoke to the people of the Nation about the state of the Nation. I had hoped to be able to defer this talk until next week because, as we all know, this is Holy Week. But what I want to say to you, the people of the country, is of such immediate need and relates so closely to the lives of human beings and the prevention of human suffering that I have felt that there should be no delay. In this decision I have been strengthened by the thought that by speaking tonight there may be greater peace of mind and the hope of Easter may be more real at firesides everywhere, and that it is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are thinking of the Prince of Peace.","Five years ago we faced a very serious problem of economic and social recovery. For four and a half years that recovery proceeded apace. It is only in the past seven months that it has received a visible setback.","And it is only within the past two months, as we have waited patiently to see whether the forces of business itself would counteract it, that it has become apparent that government itself can no longer safely fail to take aggressive government steps to meet it.","This recession has not returned us to the disasters and suffering of the beginning of 1933. Your money in the bank is safe; farmers are no longer in deep distress and have greater purchasing power; dangers of security speculation have been minimized; national income is almost 50 per cent higher than in 1932; and government has an established and accepted responsibility for relief.","But I know that many of you have lost your jobs or have seen your friends or members of your families lose their jobs, and I do not propose that the government shall pretend not to see these things. I know that the effect of our present difficulties has been uneven; that they have affected some groups and some localities seriously, but that they have been scarcely felt in others. But I conceive the first duty of government is to protect the economic welfare of all the people in all sections and in all groups. I said in my message opening the last session of Congress that if private enterprise did not provide jobs this spring, government would take up the slack that I would not let the people down. We have all learned the lesson that government cannot afford to wait until it has lost the power to act.","Therefore, I have sent a message of far-reaching importance to the Congress. I want to read to you tonight certain passages from that message, and to talk with you about them.","In that message I analyzed the causes of the collapse of 1929 in these words: \"overspeculation in and overproduction of practically every article or instrument used by man . . . millions of people had been put to work, but the products of their hands had exceeded the purchasing power of their pocketbooks. . . .Under the inexorable law of supply and demand, supplies so overran demand which would pay that production was compelled to stop. Unemployment and closed factories resulted. Hence the tragic years from 1929 to 1933.\"","I pointed out to the Congress that the national income not the Government's income, but the total of the income of all the individual citizens and families of the United States every farmer, every worker, every banker, every professional man and every person who lived on income derived from investments that national income amounted, in the year 1929, to eighty-one billion dollars. By 1932 this had fallen to thirty-eight billion dollars. Gradually, and up to a few months ago, it had risen to a total of sixty-eight billion dollars a pretty good come-back from the low point.","I then said this to the Congress:","\"But the very vigor of the recovery in both durable goods and consumers' goods brought into the picture early in 1937 certain highly undesirable practices, which were in large part responsible for the economic decline which began in the later months of that year. Again production outran the ability to buy.","\"There were many reasons for this overproduction. One was fear fear of war abroad, fear of inflation, fear of nationwide strikes. None of these fears has been borne out.","\". . . Production in many important lines of goods outran the ability of the public to purchase them. For example, through the winter and spring of 1937 cotton factories in hundreds of cases were running on a three-shift basis, piling up cotton goods in the factory and in the hands of middle men and retailers. For example, also, automobile manufacturers not only turned out a normal increase of finished cars, but encouraged the normal increase to run into abnormal figures, using every known method to push their sales. This meant, of course, that the steel mills of the Nation ran on a twenty-four hour basis, and the tire companies and cotton factories speeded up to meet the same type of abnormally stimulated demand. The buying power of the Nation lagged behind.","\"Thus by the autumn of 1937 the Nation again had stocks on hand which the consuming public could not buy because the purchasing power of the consuming public had not kept pace with the production.","\"During the same period the prices of many vital products had risen faster than was warranted. . . . In the case of many commodities the price to the consumer was raised well above the inflationary boom prices of 1929. In many lines of goods and materials, prices got so high that buyers and builders ceased to buy or to build.","\". . . The economic process of getting out the raw materials, putting them through the manufacturing and finishing processes, selling them to the retailers, selling them to the consumer, and finally using them got completely out of balance.","\"... The laying off of workers came upon us last autumn and has been continuing at such a pace ever since that all of us, Government and banking and business and workers, and those faced with destitution, recognize the need for action.\"","All of this I said to the Congress today and I repeat it to you, the people of the country tonight.","I went on to point out to the Senate and the House of Representatives that all the energies of government and business must be directed to increasing the national income, to putting more people into private jobs, to giving security and a feeling of security to all people in all walks of life.","I am constantly thinking of all our people unemployed and employed alike- of their human problems of food and clothing and homes and education and health and old age. You and I agree that security is our greatest need; the chance to work, the opportunity of making a reasonable profit in our business-whether it be a very small business or a larger one the possibility of selling our farm products for enough money for our families to live on decently. I know these are the things that decide the well-being of all our people.","Therefore, I am determined to do all in my power to help you attain that security, and because I know that the people themselves have a deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind cannot be a lasting one except on a basis of business fair dealing and a basis where all from top to bottom share in prosperity, I repeated to the Congress today that neither it nor the Chief Executive can afford \"to weaken or destroy great reforms which, during the past five years, have been effected on behalf of the American people. In our rehabilitation of the banking structure and of agriculture, in our provisions for adequate and cheaper credit for all types of business, in our acceptance of national responsibility for unemployment relief, in our strengthening of the credit of state and local government, in our encouragement of housing, slum clearance and home ownership, in our supervision of stock exchanges and public utility holding companies and the issuance of new securities, in our provision for social security, the electorate of America wants no backward steps taken.","\"We have recognized the right of labor to free organization, to collective bargaining; and machinery for the handling of labor relations is now in existence. The principles are established even though we can all admit that, through the evolution of time, administration and practices can be improved. Such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts to understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers alike.","\"The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problems which will require new adjustments. Our immediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved.","\"In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any American to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and enterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty.\"","I came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for action both by the Government and by the people, that we suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buying power. It is up to us to create an economic upturn.","\"How and where can and should the Government help to start an upward spiral?\"","I went on to propose three groups of measures and I will summarize the recommendations.","First, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to keep the Government expenditures for work relief and similar purposes during the coming fiscal year at the same rate of expenditure as at present. That includes additional money for the Works Progress Administration; additional funds for the Farm Security Administration; additional allotments for the National Youth Administration, and more money for the Civilian Conservation Corps, in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps now in operation.","These appropriations, made necessary by increased unemployment, will cost about a billion and a quarter more than the estimates which I sent to the Congress on the third of January.","Second, I told the Congress that the Administration proposes to make additional bank reserves available for the credit needs of the country. About one billion four hundred million dollars of gold now in the Treasury will be used to pay these additional expenses of the Government, and three-quarters of a billion dollars of additional credit will be made available to the banks by reducing the reserves now required by the Federal Reserve Board.","These two steps, taking care of relief needs and adding to bank credits, are in our judgment insufficient by themselves to start the Nation on a sustained upward movement.","Therefore, I came to the third kind of Government action which I consider to be vital. I said to the Congress:","\"You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with two rounds of ammunition where three rounds are necessary. If we stop at relief and credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the enemy is routed. If we are fully equipped with the third round of ammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity.\"","The third proposal is to make definite additions to the purchasing power of the Nation by providing new work over and above the continuing of the old work.","First, to enable the United States Housing Authority to undertake the immediate construction of about three hundred million dollars of additional slum clearance projects.","Second, to renew a public works program by starting as quickly as possible about one billion dollars worth of needed permanent public improvements in states, counties and cities.","Third, to add one hundred million dollars to the estimate for federal aid highways in excess of the amount I recommended in January.","Fourth, to add thirty-seven million dollars over and above the former estimate of sixty-three million dollars for flood control and reclamation.","Fifth, to add twenty-five million dollars additional for federal buildings in various parts of the country.","In recommending this program I am thinking not only of the immediate economic needs of the people of the Nation, but also of their personal liberties the most precious possession of all Americans. I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend in other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal.","Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations-not because the people of those nations disliked democracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion and government weakness through lack of leadership in government. Finally, in desperation, they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat. We in America know that our own democratic institutions can be preserved and made to work. But in order to preserve them we need to act together, to meet the problems of the Nation boldly, and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government is equal to the task of protecting the security of the people.","Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our Government to give employment to idle men. The people of America are in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the first line of that defense lies in the protection of economic security. Your Government, seeking to protect democracy, must prove that Government is stronger than the forces of business depression.","History proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and successful governments, but out of weak and helpless ones. If by democratic methods people get a government strong enough to protect them from fear and starvation, their democracy succeeds; but if they do not, they grow impatient. Therefore, the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over its government.","We are a rich Nation; we can afford to pay for security and prosperity without having to sacrifice our liberties in the bargain.","In the first century of our republic we were short of capital, short of workers and short of industrial production; but we were rich in free land, free timber and free mineral wealth. The Federal Government rightly assumed the duty of promoting business and relieving depression by giving subsidies of land and other resources.","Thus, from our earliest days we have had a tradition of substantial government help to our system of private enterprise. But today the government no longer has vast tracts of rich land to give away and we have discovered that we must spend large sums to conserve our land from further erosion and our forests from further depletion. The situation is also very different from the old days, because now we have plenty of capital, banks and insurance companies loaded with idle money; plenty of industrial productive capacity and several millions of workers looking for jobs. It is following tradition as well as necessity, if Government strives to put idle money and idle men to work, to increase our public wealth and to build up the health and strength of the people and to help our system of private enterprise to function.","It is going to cost Something to get out of this recession this way, but the profit of getting out of it will pay for the cost several times over. Lost working time is lost money. Every day that a workman is unemployed, or a machine is unused, or a business organization is marking time, is a loss to the Nation. Because of idle men and idle machines this Nation lost one hundred billion dollars between 1929 and the spring of 1933. This year you, the people of this country, are making about twelve billion dollars less than last year.","If you think back to the experiences of the early years of this Administration you will remember the doubts and fears expressed about the rising expenses of Government. But to the surprise of the doubters, as we proceeded to carry on the program which included Public Works and Work Relief, the country grew richer instead of poorer.","It is worthwhile to remember that the annual national people's income was thirty billion dollars more in 1937 than in 1932. It is true that the national debt increased sixteen billion dollars, but remember that in this increase must be included several billion dollars worth of assets which eventually will reduce that debt and that many billion dollars of permanent public improvements schools, roads, bridges, tunnels, public buildings, parks and a host of other things meet your eye in every one of the thirty one hundred counties in the United States.","No doubt you will be told that the Government spending program of the past five years did not cause the increase in our national income. They will tell you that business revived because of private spending and investment. That is true in part, for the Government spent only a small part of the total. But Government spending acted as a trigger to set off private activity. That is why the total addition to our national production and national income has been so much greater than the contribution of the Government itself.","In pursuance of that thought I said to the Congress today: \"I want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an adequate rise in national income merely by investing, lending or spending public funds. It is essential in our economy that private funds be put to work and all of us recognize that such funds are entitled to a fair profit.\"","As national income rises, \"let us not forget that Government expenditures will go down and Government tax receipts will go up.\"","The Government contribution of land that we once made to business was the land of all the people. And the Government contribution of money which we now make to business ultimately comes out of the labor of all the people. It is, therefore, only sound morality, as well as a sound distribution of buying power, that the benefits of the prosperity coming from this use of the money of all the people should be distributed among all the people- at the bottom as well as at the top. Consequently I am again expressing my hope that the Congress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill putting a floor under industrial wages and a limit on working hours to ensure a better distribution of our prosperity, a better distribution of available work, and a sounder distribution of buying power.","You may get all kinds of impressions in regard to the total cost of this new program, or in regard to the amount that will be added to the net national debt.","It is a big program. Last autumn in a sincere effort to bring Government expenditures and Government income into closer balance, the Budget I worked out called for sharp decreases in Government spending.","In the light of present conditions those estimates were far too low. This new program adds two billion and sixty-two million dollars to direct Treasury expenditures and another nine hundred and fifty million dollars to Government loans and the latter sum, because they are loans, will come back to the Treasury in the future.","The net effect on the debt of the Government is this: between now and July 1, 1939 fifteen months away the Treasury will have to raise less than a billion and a half dollars of new money.","Such an addition to the net debt of the United States need not give concern to any citizen, for it will return to the people of the United States many times over in increased buying power and eventually in much greater Government tax receipts because of the increase in the citizen income.","What I said to the Congress in the close of my message I repeat to you.","\"Let us unanimously recognize the fact that the Federal debt, whether it be twenty-five billions or forty billions, can only be paid if the Nation obtains a vastly increased citizen income. I repeat that if this citizen income can be raised to eighty billion dollars a year the national Government and the overwhelming majority of State and local governments will be 'out of the red.' The higher the national income goes the faster shall we be able to reduce the total of Federal and state and local debts. Viewed from every angle, today's purchasing power the citizens' income of today is not sufficient to drive the economic system at higher speed. Responsibility of Government requires us at this time to supplement the normal processes and in so supplementing them to make sure that the addition is adequate. We must start again on a long steady upward incline in national income.","\". . . And in that process, which I believe is ready to start, let us avoid the pitfalls of the past the overproduction, the overspeculation, and indeed all the extremes which we did not succeed in avoiding in 1929. In all of this, Government cannot and should not act alone. Business must help. I am sure business will help.","\"We need more than the materials of recovery. We need a united national will.","\"We need to recognize nationally that the demands of no group, however just, can be satisfied unless that group is prepared to share in finding a way to produce the income from which it and all other groups can be paid. . . . You, as the Congress, I, as the [INTERVIEWED], must, by virtue of our offices, seek the national good by preserving the balance between all groups and all sections.","\"We have at our disposal the national resources, the money, the skill of hand and head to raise our economic level our citizens' income. Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work together. What is needed is the will.","\"The time has come to bring that will into action with every driving force at our command. And I am determined to do my share.","\". . . Certain positive requirements seem to me to accompany the will- if we have that will.","\"There is placed on all of us the duty of self-restraint. . . . That is the discipline of a democracy. Every patriotic citizen must say to himself or herself, that immoderate statement, appeals to prejudice, the creation of unkindness, are offenses not against an individual or individuals, but offenses against the whole population of the United States. . . .","\"Self-restraint implies restraint by articulate public opinion, trained to distinguish fact from falsehood, trained to believe that bitterness is never a useful instrument in public affairs. There can be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this Nation, save through division fostered by hate. Such division there must never be.","\"Finally I should like to say a personal word to you.","I never forget that I live in a house owned by all the American people and that I have been given their trust.","I try always to remember that their deepest problems are human. I constantly talk with those who come to tell me their own points of view; with those who manage the great industries and financial institutions of the country; with those who represent the farmer and the worker; and often with average citizens without high position who come to this house. And constantly I seek to look beyond the doors of the White House, beyond the officialdom of the National Capital, into the hopes and fears of men and women in their homes. I have traveled the country over many times. My friends, my enemies, my daily mail, bring to me reports of what you are thinking and hoping. I want to be sure that neither battles nor burdens of office shall ever blind me to an intimate knowledge of the way the American people want to live and the simple purposes for which they put me here.","In these great problems of government I try not to forget that what really counts at the bottom of it all, is that the men and Women willing to work can have a decent job to take care of themselves and their homes and their children adequately; that the farmer, the factory worker, the storekeeper, the gas station man, the manufacturer, the merchant big and small the banker who takes pride in the help he gives to the building of his community, that all these can be sure of a reasonable profit and safety for the savings they earn not today nor tomorrow alone, but as far ahead as they can see.","I can hear your unspoken wonder as to where we are headed in this troubled world. I cannot expect all of the people to understand all of the people's problems; but it is my job to try to understand those problems.","I always try to remember that reconciling differences cannot satisfy everyone completely. Because I do not expect too much, I am not disappointed. But I know that I must never give up-that I must never let the greater interest of all the people down, merely because that might be for the moment the easiest personal way out.","I believe we have been right in the course we have charted. To abandon our purpose of building a greater, a more stable and a more tolerant America, would be to miss the tide and perhaps to miss the port. I propose to sail ahead. I feel sure that your hopes and your help are with me. For to reach a port, we must sail sail, not tie at anchor sail, not drift."]}

You face many tough issues as Commander in Chief, for instance, drawing down forces in Iraq and ramping up in Afghanistan. What goes through your mind when you are in front of these marines here at Camp Lejeune and you have to tell them that they're going into harm's way?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, look, this is the most important, most sobering decision that you make as the [INTERVIEWER]: in your role as Commander in Chief. And my main goal is to make sure that any time we are deploying our men and women in uniform, that the civilian leadership has done everything that it needs to do to make the best decision possible.","And that means consulting with our commanders on the ground; it means talking to every level of Pentagon leadership, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to my Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates; it means also consulting with a wide range of people outside, so that you're not just listening to one voice, you're listening to a whole bunch of them and then arriving at some sort of consensus.","And I'm confident that with respect to our drawdown in Iraq, it's done in a way that General Odierno is comfortable with, General Petraeus is comfortable with, that our diplomatic efforts can be ramped up to accompany that drawdown.","With respect to Afghanistan, I think that all of us believe that the situation has deteriorated somewhat there, and that's why I immediately made a decision for us to send additional troops, including marines from Camp Lejeune. But I also think that we've got to refine our goals and our strategy more effectively. I think in Afghanistan we've seen that strategy drift a little bit.","And, you know, my most important job as Commander in Chief is to make sure that if we're sending folks there, we have a well-thought-out strategy, clear goals, and that they're achievable and that I can marshal and maintain the strongest support possible from folks back home.","[INTERVIEWER]: And to sort of continue with that topic, you said that the U.S. will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and to combat extremism in the region. What will this mean for our men and women in Afghanistan now and in the future, sir?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, first of all, by sending an additional 17,000 troops, we are obviously going to be bolstering our forces in Afghanistan, and that will obviously be important to the folks that are already there. If you talk to General McKiernan, our commander in Afghanistan, he will tell you that especially in the southern regions of the country you've seen brazen attacks from Taliban forces, extremist forces, and we want to make sure that we have the force necessary to meet that.","I also think that because you're going to see that additional engagement, there is the risk of greater additional casualties, at least in the short term, just as there was in Iraq. And, you know, that's something that, you know, we'll have to monitor very carefully.","The key, though, is to understand that we are not going to win in Afghanistan or get an acceptable outcome in Afghanistan if we're only dependent on our military. Our military does everything that's asked of them, but anybody who knows the region knows that if we don't have a Afghan Government that can deliver for its people, if we don't have an economic development strategy where farmers don't have to grown heroin poppy but instead can grow other crops so that they're not feeding narcoterrorism, if we don't have Pakistan providing us support on the other side of the border that cleans out some of these areas where Al Qaida and the Taliban are using as safe havens, then this isn't going to work.","And my goal is to have a comprehensive strategy of not just force, but also diplomacy and development that is all moving in concert to get the kind of outcome we want.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yes, sir. You just talked about your plan for drawing down combatant forces in Iraq by the end of August 2010. Why is this timeline so important to you, sir?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, because I think it's important, first of all, to send a very strong, clear signal to the Iraqis that they are going to need to be taking these responsibilities, that we mean it when we say that we're not going to be a permanent occupying force in Iraq. And we already have an agreement, a security agreement that was signed by the previous administration and by the Maliki Government that says we've got to be out of there by the end of 2011. We don't want to have 140,000 troops there the day before we have to be out of there; we've got to have a glide path that is responsible in pulling our troops out.","And so what we've done is we've set a point of August 31, 2010, as a transition point, after the Iraqi elections have taken place, where there's, obviously, potential vulnerability. After that point, you're looking at maybe six brigades, 35,000 to 50,000 troops overall, who are providing logistical support, training, are providing protection for U.S. civilian as well as military personnel, and some counterterrorist counterterrorism striking capability.","That then gets phased down over the next year and a half or so, until finally at the end of 2011, we should have no troops there. I think it's a responsible plan that meets our objectives, and it's one that was created in close consultation with our military commanders on the ground.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yes, sir. And in continuing on with that topic, what will be the major measuring stick, if you will, when we talk about the 35,000 to 50,000 troops? What is it that's going to really sway you in terms of, is it 35,000, is it 40,000, or is it 50,000?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, I think that all these decisions have to be made based on what the situation is at the time, and it's very hard to anticipate exactly what things are going to be like in 18 months. If we continue to make strong progress in training the Iraqi security forces, if the elections are peaceful, if we've seen resolution of some of the issues that are creating sectarian tension in Iraq, like the oil laws and how much power the national Government has versus the Provincial governments, if those issues are getting resolved peacefully through a regular political process, then that probably means that we're going to be able to have less troops support there, as of August 31st of next year. If some of those things haven't happened, then that will put more of a burden on us, as well as the Iraqis.","So our hope is, is that we're doing everything right leading up to that point so that by the time we get to that transition period, we are well prepared to start phasing our entire operation out of Iraq.","[INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], how does your plan for Iraq and Afghanistan deal with the issue of relieving the pressure on the fighting force and their families?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, this is one of the most important issues that we face. I don't need to tell you the enormous burden that our men and women in uniform have been under: so many people I meet on repeated tours three, four tours of duty; the stop-loss policy that's hit a number of our fighting men and women; the burden on military families, something that my wife, the First Lady, Michelle, has taken very seriously and talked to a lot of families about.","So first of all, obviously, as we start drawing down, that puts less pressure on military families. That means that we can start ending we can end stop-loss policy. We can start getting back to the kinds of rotations where, you know, after a year of service, then people have a lot more time back home than they have had over the last several years, which is good for everybody.","In addition, my budget has also called for an increase in the force structure, the size of the Marines and of the Army. So that will also relieve some of the pressure, and it will allow us to meet some of the strategic needs not just in Afghanistan and Iraq, but around the world. I mean, there's a big world out there, and right now we don't have the kind of strategic capability that we should to meet other emergency situations that might arise.","Along those same lines, one big piece of relief, I think you heard during the speech today, is that we're going to have a pay increase for our troops. That, obviously, is important. But beyond that, in the recovery plan that I got passed through Congress we have a whole slew of steps that we're taking that are going to provide some immediate help to the military families. There's a lot of money in there for construction of wounded warrior treatment centers, construction of additional housing and facilities for military families.","In my budget, we've got additional money for daycare, additional money for training, making sure that the GI bill that was signed last year by Congress, that that is adequately funded and implemented.","So one of the things that's very important to me is improved quality of life, making sure that our troops and their families are supported, honored, and that our veterans, when they come home, are treated with the respect and the care that they need.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yes, sir. I have a final question for you, sir; I know you have a full plate today. If you could sit down and speak to each military member and their family, as Commander in Chief, what would you tell them, and how would you convey your commitment to them, sir?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, first of all, what I'd tell them is thank you. And you know, just yesterday, I had the mother and father of a fallen marine, who actually was stationed here at Camp Lejeune I had written them a letter of gratitude and condolence. Their son had just been killed relatively recently. They actually got a ride on Air Force One down here because their grandchildren, their son's children, are still down here.","And what I told them was, first of all, thank you; that all of America is grateful. We enjoy the freedoms we do because of what young men and women like that are willing to do on our behalf. And I wanted to tell them also that I carry them in my mind every single day when I'm making decisions; that when I am thinking about troop deployments, when I'm thinking about budgets, when I'm thinking about what our foreign policy is going to be, uppermost in my mind is understanding that young men and women are willing to offer up their last full measure of devotion to this country. The least they can expect is, is that their [INTERVIEWED] is going to get it right and to keep them in mind when he is making the decision.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yes, sir. I really appreciate you joining us on the Pentagon Channel, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]: I enjoyed it very much. Thank you so much.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]: You bet."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressaboutsecondannualforeignpolicyreportthecongress","text":["Good morning, my fellow Americans:","Over the past 10 years, Presidents of the United States have come before the American people in times of crisis to talk about war or the threat of war.","Today I am able to talk to you in a more hopeful and positive vein about how we are moving this Nation and the world toward a lasting peace.","We have brought ourselves to a time of transition, from war toward peace, and this is a good time to gain some perspective on where we are and where we are headed.","Today I am sending to the Congress my second annual comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affairs. It discusses not only what we have done but why we have done it, and how we intend to proceed in the future.","I do not intend to summarize all that is in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time. Instead, I would like to focus on three key points: How we are getting out of the war this Nation has been in for the past 6 years; How we have created a new and different foreign policy approach for the United States in a greatly changed world; and How we are applying that approach in working with others to build a lasting peace.","The most immediate and anguishing problem that faced this Administration 2 years ago was the war in Vietnam. We have come a long way since then. Two years ago, when this Administration took office, there were almost 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. Within 60 days we will have brought home 260,000 men, and this spring I will announce a new schedule of withdrawals.","Two years ago, our casualties each month were five times as high as they are today.","Two years ago, the additional demands of the Vietnam war cost us approximately $22 billion per year. That cost has been cut in half.","Much of the progress in Vietnam was due to the success of the allied operations against the enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia last spring.","The clear proof is in this figure: American casualties after Cambodia have been half the rate they were before Cambodia. Our decision to clean out the sanctuaries in Cambodia saved thousands of American lives. And it enabled us to continue withdrawing our men on schedule.","Just as last year's cutoff of supplies through Cambodia has saved lives and insured our withdrawal program this year, the purpose of this year's disruption of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos is to save lives and insure the success of our withdrawal program next year.","The disruption of the Communist supply line through Laos is being accomplished by South Vietnamese troops, with no U.S. ground troops or advisers. Their army is doing the fighting, with our air support, and the intensity of the fighting is evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy.","Consider this combination of events that many people thought was impossible only 2 years ago:","We have kept our commitments as we have taken out our troops. South Vietnam now has an excellent opportunity not only to survive but to build a strong, free society.","Thanks to the disruption of so much of the enemy's supplies, Americans are leaving South Vietnam in safety; we would much prefer to leave South Vietnam in peace. Negotiation remains the best and quickest way to end the war in a way that will not only end U.S. involvement and casualties but will mean an end to the fighting between North and South Vietnamese.","On October 7, we made a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace. We proposed: an immediate standstill cease-fire throughout Indochina to stop the fighting, an Indochina peace conference, the withdrawal of all outside forces, a political settlement fair to both sides, the immediate release of all prisoners of war.","I reaffirm that proposal today. It is supported by every government in Indochina except one the Government of North Vietnam.","I once again urge Hanoi to join us in this search for peace.","If North Vietnam wishes to negotiate with the United States, they will have to recognize that time is running out. With the exception of the prisoners-of-war issue, if North Vietnam continues to refuse to discuss our peace proposals, they will soon find they have no choice but to negotiate only with the South Vietnamese.","Our eventual goal is a total withdrawal of all outside forces. But as long as North Vietnam continues to hold a single American prisoner, we shall have forces in South Vietnam. The American prisoners of war will not be forgotten by their Government.","I am keeping my pledge to end America's involvement in this war. But the main point I want to discuss with you today and the main theme of my report to the Congress is the future, not the past. It matters very much how we end this war. To end a war is simple.","But to end a war in a way that will not bring on another war is far from simple.","In Southeast Asia today, aggression is failing thanks to the determination of the South Vietnamese people and to the courage and sacrifice of America's fighting men.","That brings us to a point that we have been at several times before in this century: aggression trained back, a war ending.","We are at a critical moment in history: What America does or fails to do will determine whether peace and freedom can be won in the coming generation.","That is why the way in which we end this conflict is so crucial to our efforts to build a lasting peace in coming decades.","The right way out of Vietnam is crucial to our changing role in the world and to peace in the world.","To understand the nature of the new American role we must consider the great historical changes that have taken place.","For 25 years after World War II, the United States was not only the leader of the non-Communist world, it was the primary supporter and defender of this free world as well. But today our allies and friends have gained new strength and self-confidence. They are now able to participate much more fully not only in their own defense but in adding their moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order.","Today our adversaries no longer present a solidly united front; we can now differentiate in our dealings with them. Today neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has a clear-cut nuclear advantage; the time is therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arms.","The world has changed. Our foreign policy must change with it.","We have learned in recent years the dangers of over-involvement. The other danger a grave risk we are equally determined to avoid is under-involvement. After a long and unpopular war, there is temptation to turn inward to withdraw from the world, to back away from our commitments. That deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism is surely the road to war.","Our foreign policy today steers a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under-involvement.","That policy, which I first enunciated in Guam 19 months ago,1 represents our basic approach to the world:","1 See 1969 volume, Item 279.","We will maintain our commitments, but we will make sure our own troop levels or any financial support to other nations is appropriate to current threats and needs.","We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security.","But we will look to threatened countries and their neighbors to assume primary responsibility for their own defense, and we will provide support where our interests call for that support and where it can make a difference.","These principles are not limited to security matters.","We shall pursue economic policies at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political ties between nations. As we actively seek to help other nations expand their economies, we can legitimately expect them to work with us in averting economic problems of our own.","As we continue to send economic aid to developing nations, we will expect countries on the receiving end to mobilize their resources; we will look to other developed nations to do more in furnishing assistance; and we will channel our aid increasingly through groups of nations banded together for mutual support.","This new sharing of responsibility requires not less American leadership than in the past, but rather a new, more subtle, form of leadership. No single nation can build a peace alone; peace can only be built by the willing hands and minds-of all. In the modern world, leadership cannot be \"do-it-yourself\" the path of leadership is in providing the help, the motive, the inspiration to do it together.","In carrying out what is referred to as the Nixon Doctrine, we recognize that we cannot transfer burdens too swiftly. We must strike a balance between doing too much and preventing self-reliance, and suddenly doing too little and undermining self-confidence. We intend to give our friends the time and the means to adjust, materially and psychologically, to a new form of American participation in the world.","How have we applied our new foreign policy during the past year? And what is our future agenda as we work with others to build a stable world order?","In Western Europe, we have shifted from predominance to partnership with our allies. Our ties with Western Europe are central to the structure of peace because its nations are rich in tradition and experience, strong economically, vigorous in diplomacy and culture; they are in a position to take a major part in building a world of peace.","Our ties were strengthened on my second trip to Europe this summer and reflected in our close consultation on arms control negotiations. At our suggestion, the NATO alliance made a thorough review of its military strategy and posture. As a result, we have reached new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly.","In Eastern Europe, our exchange of state visits with Romania and my meeting last fall with Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia are examples of our search for wider reconciliation with the nations that used to be considered behind an Iron Curtain. Looking ahead in Europe: We shall cooperate in our political and economic relations across the Atlantic as the Common Market grows. We and our allies will make the improvements necessary to carry out our common defense strategy. Together we stand ready to reduce forces in Western Europe in exchange for mutual reductions in Eastern Europe.","The problems of Africa are great, but so is her potential. The United States will support her peoples' efforts to build a continent that provides social justice and economic expansion.","Turning to our own hemisphere: In Latin America, there was too much tendency in the past to take our closest friends and neighbors for granted. Recently, we have paid new respect to their proud traditions. Our trade, credit, and economic policies have been reexamined and reformed to respond to their concerns and their ideas, as well as to our own interests.","Our new Latin American policy is designed to help them help themselves; our new attitude will not only aid their progress but add to their dignity.","Great changes are brewing throughout the American hemisphere. We can have no greater goal than to help provide the means for necessary change to be accomplished in peace and for all change to be in the direction of greater self-reliance.","Turning to the Far East: a new Asia is emerging. The old enmities of World War II are dead or dying. Asian states are stronger and are joining together in vigorous regional groupings.","Here the doctrine that took shape last year is taking hold today, helping to spur self-reliance and cooperation between states. In Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, we have consolidated bases and reduced American forces. We have relaxed trade and travel restrictions to underline our readiness for greater contact with Communist China. Looking ahead in that area: While continuing to help our friends help themselves, we must begin to consider how regional associations can work together with the major powers in the area for a durable peace. We will work to build a strong partnership with Japan that will accommodate our mutual interests.","We will search for consecutive discussions with Communist China while maintaining our defense commitment to Taiwan. When the Government of the People's Republic of China is ready to engage in talks, it will find us receptive to agreements that further the legitimate national interests of China and its neighbors.","In Asia, we can see tomorrow's world in microcosm. An economically powerful democratic free nation, Japan, is seeking new markets; a potentially powerful Communist nation, China, will one day seek new outlets and new relations; a Communist competitor, the Soviet Union, has interests there as well; and the independent non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia are already working together in regional association. These great forces are bound to interact in the not too distant future. In the way they work together and in the way we cooperate with their relationship is the key to permanent peace in that area the Far East, the scene of such a painful legacy of the recent past, can become an example of peace and stability in the future.","In the Middle East, the United States took the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace.","Along the Suez Canal a year ago, there was daily combat on the ground and in the air. Diplomacy was at an impasse. The danger of local conflict was magnified by growing Soviet involvement and the possibility of great powers being drawn into confrontation.","America took the lead in arranging a cease-fire and getting negotiations started. We are seeing to it that the balance of power, so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting, is not upset. Working behind the scenes, when a crisis arose in Jordan, the United States played a key role in seeing that order was restored and an invasion was abandoned.","We recognize that centuries of suspicion and decades of hostility cannot be ended overnight. There are great obstacles in the way of a permanent, peaceful settlement, and painful compromise is required by all concerned.","We are encouraged by the willingness of each of the parties to begin to look to the larger interest of peace and stability throughout the Middle East. There is still the risk of war, but now for the first time in years the parties are actively calculating the risks of peace.","The policy of the United States will continue to be to promote peace talks-not to try to impose a peace from the outside, but to support the peace efforts of the parties in the region themselves.","One way to support these efforts is for the United States to discourage any outside power from trying to exploit the situation for its own advantage.","Another way for us to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement is this: The United States is fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keeping the peace arrived at through negotiation between the parties.","We know what our vital interests are in the Middle East. Those interests include friendly and constructive relations with all nations in the area. Other nations know that we are ready to protect those vital interests. And one good reason why other nations take us at our word in the Middle East is because the United States has kept its word in Southeast Asia.","We now come to a matter that affects every nation: the relations between the world's two great super powers.","Over the past e years, in some fields the Soviet Union and the United States have moved ahead together. We have taken the first step toward cooperation in outer space. We have both ratified the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. Just 2 weeks ago, we signed a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons from the seabeds.","These are hopeful signs, but certain other Soviet actions are reason for concern. There is need for much more cooperation in reducing tensions in the Middle East and in ending harassment of Berlin. We must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenges in sensitive areas such as the Caribbean.","In the long run, the most significant result of negotiations between the super powers in the past year could be in the field of arms control.","The strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union have produced the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conducted between our two nations. Each side has had the chance to explain at length the concerns caused by the posture of the other side. The talks have been conducted in a serious way without the old lapses into propaganda.","If both sides continue in this way, there is reason to hope that specific agreements will be reached to curb the arms race.","Taking a first step in limiting the capacity of mankind to destroy itself would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world; it would add to the security of both the Soviet Union and the United States, and it would add to the world's peace of mind.","In all our relations with the Soviets, we shall make the most progress by recognizing that in many cases our national interests are not the same. It serves no purpose to pretend they are; our differences are not matters of mood, they are matters of substance. But in many other cases, our separate national interests can best be pursued by a sober consideration of the world interest.","The United States will deal, as it must, from strength: We will not reduce our defenses below the level I consider essential to our national security.","A strong America is essential to the cause of peace today. Until we have the kind of agreements we can rely on, we shall remain strong.","But America's power will always be used for building a peace, never for breaking it only for defending freedom, never for destroying it.","America's strength will be, as it must be, second to none; but the strength that this Nation is proudest of is the strength of our determination to create a peaceful world.","We all know how every town or city develops a sense of community when its citizens come together to meet a common need.","The common needs of the world today, about which there can be no disagreement or conflict of national interest, are plain to see.","We know that we must act as one world in restoring the world's environment, before pollution of the seas and skies overwhelms every nation. We know we must stop the flow of narcotics; we must counter the outbreaks of hijacking and kidnaping; we must share the great discoveries about the oceans and outer space. The United States is justly proud of the lead it has taken in working within the United Nations, and within the NATO alliance, to come to grips with these problems and with these opportunities.","Our work here is a beginning, not only in coping with the new challenges of technology and modern life but of developing a worldwide \"sense of community\" that will ease tension, reduce suspicion, and thereby promote the process of peace.","That process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect.","We can have that mutual respect with our friends, without dominating them or without letting them down.","We can have that mutual respect with our adversaries, without compromising our principles or weakening our resolve.","And we can have that mutual respect among ourselves, without stifling dissent or losing our capacity for action.","Our goal is something Americans have not enjoyed in this century: a full generation of peace. A full generation of peace depends not only on the policy of one party or of one nation or one alliance or one bloc of nations.","Peace for the next generation depends on our ability to make certain that each nation has a share in its shaping, and that every nation has a stake in its lasting.","This is the hard way, requiring patience, restraint, understanding, and when necessary-bold, decisive action. But history has taught us that the old diplomacy of imposing a peace by the fiat of great powers simply does not work.","I believe that the new diplomacy of partnership, of mutual respect, of dealing with strength and determination will work.","I believe that the right degree of American involvement not too much and not too little will evoke the right response from our other partners on this globe in building for our children the kind of world they deserve: a world of opportunity in a world without war."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfreeandfairtrade","text":["My fellow Americans:","In my last radio address, I discussed my decision not to impose quotas or tariffs on footwear imports. Protectionism, I said, costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs. Instead of closing down markets at home and throwing Americans out of work, we should be stepping up our efforts to open markets abroad and create American jobs by increasing exports. I instructed the United States Trade Representative to begin investigations of unfair trading practices on the part of our trading partners. We have the authority to counter unfair trading practices by initiating investigations, entering negotiations, and taking active countermeasures if those negotiations are unsuccessful.","Therefore, I'm directing the U.S. Trade Representative to start proceedings in three cases of unfair trade: one, against a Korean law that prohibits fair competition of U.S. life and fire insurance firms in the Korean market in direct contradiction of treaty obligations; two, against a Brazilian law that has restricted U.S. exports of computers and related products and squeezed out some American computer firms operating there; and three, against restrictive practices dealing with tobacco products in Japan that unfairly block U.S. entry into that market. I've also ordered acceleration of ongoing efforts to open up Japanese markets in leather and leather footwear and to challenge the European Community's subsidies on canned fruit. On these two cases we're setting a deadline of December 1, 1985. I have directed that a list be prepared of countermeasures which will be taken if these disputes are not resolved by then.","We hope that through these negotiations we will be able to convince our trading partners to stop their unfair trading practices and open those markets that are now closed to American exports. We will take countermeasures only as a last resort, but our trading partners should not doubt our determination to see international trade conducted fairly with the same rules applicable to all. I'm committed to and will continue to fight for fair trade. American exporters and American workers deserve a fair shake abroad, and we intend to see they get it. Our objective will always be to make world trading partnerships freer and fairer for all. So, while we will use our powers as a lever to open closed doors abroad, we will continue to resist protectionist measures that would only raise prices, lock out trade, and destroy the jobs and prosperity trade brings to all. There are no winners in a trade war, only losers.","As we take these important steps to make our trading system freer and fairer, let's also look at the subject of trade in its broader context. Some point to our trade deficit with alarm, but our share of world exports has not declined. In 1980 our share of world exports was just below 12 percent; in 1984 it was just over 12 percent. We have a trade deficit not because exports are declining but because imports are rising at a much more rapid pace. Why? Because our economy is, in a sense, out of balance with many of our trading partners. The strong growth of the U.S. economy has simply not been matched by many countries abroad.","Our tax cuts ignited a noninflationary economic expansion that has put over 8 million Americans to work in the last 33 months alone. In fact, numbers released yesterday showed a dramatic drop in overall unemployment to 6.9 percent, the lowest in 5 years. Contrast that to Europe where a mix of protectionist policies and continued high tax rates have produced economic anemia and where they've actually lost jobs overall in the last 10 years. And many developing countries with massive debts, high taxes, and low or negative growth find it difficult to afford U.S. exports; some look to our strong dollar as the culprit. And, yes, a strong dollar does make it harder for American firms to sell their products abroad, but the strong dollar is a reflection of America's economic strength. Low taxes and low inflation make America an attractive place to invest. We can either balance the trade deficit up by encouraging our trading partners to adopt the high-growth policies of tax cuts and open markets, or we can balance down by adopting the no growth policies of tax hikes and protectionism.","The choice is clear. Let's take the high road to prosperity by fighting for an open, free, and fair trading system with our economic partners and by encouraging them to adopt low tax, high employment growth policies. And let's keep our engines of growth humming here at home, too, by passing a new tax plan for America, a fair share tax plan for all.","Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you all."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationfromelkonevada","text":["About Search"," ","My fellow citizens:","We have been through an arduous campaign. It has been almost unique as a campaign of education in the great domestic and international problems which have arisen out of events of the last 15 years.","I have endeavored to place these problems before the people as I see them from the facts and experience that have come to me in these past years. I wished the people to realize more intimately the difficulties with which their Government has been confronted, the disasters which have been averted, and the forces which have been mobilized for their support and their protection.","I hope from these discussions that the people will realize the great crisis that we have successfully passed and the unprecedented measures taken which have been designed solely that we might protect and restore the system of life and of government endeared to us over 150 years--a government that has given to us protection from distress and allayed the forces which would otherwise have wrecked our homes and our firesides. But more than that, I hope I have given an understanding of these measures that have been designed for counterattack upon this crisis. These measures are now demonstrating their strength and effectiveness not only at home but abroad, evidences of which are multiplying throughout the country in the return of more than half a million men to work monthly, and that we have again resumed the road toward prosperity.","I might add that the figure which I have given during the last few days of the return of 1 million men to work since the adjournment of the Congress have been added to during the day today by the estimates of the American Federation of Labor which increased the estimates, which I have given to you, by nearly 300,000 men.","I wish to emphasize the greatest function of the American citizen, the one which each of us should perform tomorrow. The ballot is that most sacred individual act which preserves the great system of self-government which we have inherited and which should carry forward at any cost. It is a direct opportunity for every man and woman to express their views in terms of equality with every other citizen as to the policies and kind of a government that they wish carried out in the next 4 years. And I have a deep feeling that the choice that you make now is more than the choice for another 4 years. There is great divergence in the philosophy of government between the parties which may affect events over a generation; a mistaken choice may hazard the welfare of our children and our children's children. I have been fighting that the wrong course may not be adopted, not by appeal to destructive emotion, but by truth and logic. I have tried to dissolve the mirage of promises by the reality of facts.","I am a believer in party government. It is only through party organization that our people can give coherent expression to their views upon public issues. There is no other way except by revolution, but we in America have ordained that the ballot shall be used for peaceful determination and not violence.","We are a nation of progressives. We wish to see our Nation march forward. We differ strongly as to the method to progress. I differ widely with the principles and views advocated by our opponents, but it is not my purpose to review them at this moment. I feel deeply that the Republican Party has been the party of progress in our history from the days of Abraham Lincoln. It has built the progress of the Nation upon the foundations of national principles and national ideals.","We are a nation of homes from which the accomplishment of individuals is nurtured by the maximum freedom in an ordered liberty. The ultimate goal of our progress is to build for security and happiness in these homes where the inspiration of our religious faiths will implant in our children those principles of social order and idealism, and where our Government will contribute in safeguarding their future opportunity for them.","The action of our Nation has been modified and benefited by the enfranchisement of women. They equally with the men bear the shocks from economic disaster. With them lies largely the guardianship of the fundamental ideals, because concentrated in their lives and their responsibilities is a solicitude for the preservation of the home and the inspiration for the future. And in these labors our Government can contribute to strengthen their accomplishment and their influence.","Our women give with lavish hands, not only to childhood, but, as well, to the creation of those conserving customs upon which are builded all the blessings of our ordered Government. They thus give to government a large measure of the true strength of its foundations. It is but just that they receive back, in return, all that the Government can give them to assure them of security and the enlargement of the equal opportunity to their children and to themselves, to widen the field for the use of their own powers of mind and spirit.","It is they who are mobilizing new public regard to our obligations to home and children of the future; it is they who are mobilizing the public opinion on the maintenance of peace in the world.","The men of our country carry the frontline of battle through their initiative, their enterprise, their hopes, their courage.","The immediate question before our country is in whose direction shall be the measures by which we shall emerge from our present difficulties. In the longer view our problems are the questions that the world should have peace; that the prosperity of the Nation shall be diffused to all, and that we shall build more strongly the ideal of equal opportunity amongst all our people; that we shall secure that obedience to law which is essential to assurance of life in our institutions; that honesty and righteousness in business shall confirm the confidence of our people in our institutions and laws; that our Government shall contribute to leadership in these matters.","It is my deep conviction that for the welfare of the United States the Republican Party should continue to administer the Government. Those men and women who have supported the party over these many years should not be led astray by false gods arrayed in the rainbow colors of promises. They have but to review the performance and the sense of responsibility, the constructive action, the maintenance of national ideals by the Republican Party, in every national crisis including the present, always in opposition to the destructive forces of sectional and group action of our opponents.","Election Day is more than a day set aside for casting of our several ballots. There is a solemnity in the feeling of that day, the sense of being in the presence of a great invisible power when the united people of a great nation give their final judgment on great issues. We cannot feel that any human power alone can give us such emotions; rather we must trust that we are sensing the movements of that Ruler of the universe in whose beneficence and in whose favor we have been blessed throughout our history.","As a final word, I wish to convey my deep gratitude to the many hundreds of thousands of people who have come to stations and to meetings to welcome and encourage me during this past month and to the many millions more who have responded to me over the radio. I wish to express my gratitude to the young men and the young women who have organized their special movement to my support, for in them lies a special energy and idealism which drives and inspires the country; to the veterans' service leagues whose tested patriotism has supported me in this campaign; to the devoted women who, realizing the results at stake, have worked untiringly for the return of this administration; and to the organizations of men throughout the country who have been unceasing through this campaign in their presentation to the American people of the principles and ideals for which I have stood."," "]}

From Thanksgiving to Hanukkah, which our Jewish community is now celebrating, to Christmas in 3 weeks' time, this is a season of hope and of love.","Certainly one of the greatest blessings for people everywhere is the family itself. The American Family Institute recently dedicated its book of essays, \"The Family in the Modern World,\" to Maria Victoria Walesa, daughter of Danuta and Lech Walesa, to whose christening came 7,000 Poles expressing their belief that the family remains the foundation of freedom. And, of course, they're right. It's in the family where we learn to think for ourselves, care for others, and acquire the values of self-reliance, integrity, responsibility, and compassion.","Families stand at the center of society, so building our future must begin by preserving family values. Tragically, too many in Washington has been asking us to swallow a whopper: namely, that bigger government is the greatest force for fairness and progress. But this so-called solution has given most of us a bad case of financial indigestion. How can families survive when big government's powers to tax, inflate, and regulate absorb their wealth, usurp their rights, and crush their spirit? Was there compassion for a working family in 21 1/2- percent interest rates, 12 1/2-percent inflation, and taxes soaring out of sight? Consider the cost of childrearing. It now takes $85,000 to raise a child to age 18, and family incomes haven't kept up. During the 1970's real wages actually declined over 2 percent. Consider taxes. In 1948 the tax on the average two-child family was just $9. Today it is $2,900.","As economic and social pressures have increased, the bonds that bind families together have come under strain. For example, three times as many families are headed by single parents today as in 1960. Many single parents make heroic sacrifices and deserve all our support. But there is no question that many well-intentioned Great Society-type programs contributed to family breakups, welfare dependency, and a large increase in births out of wedlock. In the 1970's the number of single mothers rose from 8 to 13 percent among whites and from 31 to a tragic 47 percent among blacks. Too often their children grow up poor, malnourished, and lacking in motivation. It's a path to social and health problems, low school performance, unemployment, and delinquency.","If we strengthen families, we'll help reduce poverty and the whole range of other social problems.","We can begin by reducing the economic burdens of inflation and taxes, and we're doing this. Since 1980 inflation has been chopped by three-fourths. Taxes have been cut for every family that earns a living, and we've increased the tax credit for child care. Yesterday we learned that our growing economy reduced unemployment to 8.2 percent last month. The payroll employment figure went up by 370,000 jobs.","At the same time, new policies are helping our neediest families move from dependence to independence. Our new job training law will train over a million needy and unemployed Americans each year for productive jobs. [SPEAKER] should add that our enterprise zones proposal would stimulate new businesses, bringing jobs and hope to some of the most destitute areas of the country. The Senate has adopted this proposal. But after 2 years of delay, the House Democratic leadership only recently agreed to hold its first hearing on the legislation. This is a jobs bill America needs. And come January, we expect action.","We're moving forward on many other fronts. We've made prevention of drug abuse among youth a top priority. We'll soon announce a national missing children's center to help find and rescue children who've been abducted and exploited. We're working with States and local communities to increase the adoption of special-needs children. More children with permanent homes mean fewer children with permanent problems.","We're also stiffening the enforcement of child support from absent parents. And we're trying hard to improve education through more discipline, a return to the basics, and through reforms like tuition tax credits to help hard-working parents.","In coming months, we'll propose new ways to help families stay together, remain independent, and cope with the pressures of modern life. A cornerstone of our efforts must be assisting families to support themselves. As Franklin Roosevelt said almost 50 years ago, \"Self-help and self-control are the essence of the American tradition.\"","In Washington everyone looks out for special interest groups. Well, i think families are pretty special. And with your help, we'll continue looking out for their interests.","Till next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsradioaddressthenationunitedstatesassistanceforthenicaraguandemocratic2","text":["About Search"," ","My fellow Americans:","We're about to mark an important anniversary, but it'll be no cause for celebration. Eight years ago tomorrow, the Sandinista Communists came to power in the Central American country of Nicaragua. It may be hard to remember now, the great hopes with which their revolution was first greeted. The hated dictator Anastasio Somoza had been toppled, and the world looked forward to a bright future for Nicaragua. Little did we think then that the future the Sandinistas were planning for Nicaragua would be darker than anything that suffering country had ever before experienced.","The Sandinistas spelled out their plans for subversion and aggression throughout Central America in the secret, but now notorious, 72-Hour Document, and it wasn't long before they started carrying them out. Arms shipments began flowing to the Communist guerrillas throughout Latin America-in El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, and other countries. Within Nicaragua, the Sandinistas quickly built up the apparatus of a police state: closing churches and extinguishing the free press. The ranks of political prisoners swelled into the thousands, and beatings, torture, and official murder became the order of the day. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas began a campaign of slaughter against the peaceful Miskito Indians. One in every ten Nicaraguans is now a refugee-leaving home, family, and friends to escape the oppression inside that country.","If the Sandinistas get their way, the torment of that sad country will soon spread throughout the entire region, engulfing the young democracies that surround Nicaragua. As I said in New York a few months ago, the democratic aspirations of millions in Central America now hang in the balance. The elected leaders of neighboring Central American countries know that until democracy comes to Nicaragua their own democracies will never be safe. And that is why, along with us, they have insisted on one thing: free, fair, and regularly scheduled elections in Nicaragua, the establishment of a genuinely democratic system and all the freedoms such a system depends on and encourages—freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of worship.","This is what the Nicaraguan freedom fighters are fighting for, and this is why we must support them. We have worked in many ways to counter the spread of communism in Central America and those nations I've mentioned that are threatened by Nicaragua. We've instituted economic assistance to the region, military assistance to threatened democracies, and, together with our Central American allies, vigorous efforts to negotiate a peaceful and democratic outcome. But we know from experience that the Sandinistas will never negotiate seriously unless they see that the freedom fighters are a force to be reckoned with. Without the freedom fighters backing them up, negotiations can amount to no more than a hoax. Believe me, the current efforts of the Central American democracies to seek a peaceful and democratic outcome will not succeed if the Communists think that all they have to do is wait a few months and see if this country still has the resolve to support those who seek freedom in Nicaragua. The Soviets have spent over $1 billion to prop up the Sandinista regime and to defeat the freedom fighters. The Soviets know what's at stake in Nicaragua, and they know that the freedom fighters are all that stand between them and domination of the entire region.","Now, some tell me that the people in this country just don't care about the freedom fighters, but I don't think that's true. The more people know about the Sandinista Communists, the more they support the freedom fighters. That's why the closer you get to Nicaragua, the stronger their support grows. Public opinion polls in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala show overwhelming support for contra aid. In Honduras 81 percent of the people support it. Of course, inside Nicaragua they don't have any polls, but the people there are daily risking their lives, giving whatever help they can to see the young men and boys who are fighting for their country's freedom.","In this country, too, we have seen support grow dramatically as the American people learn the facts about Nicaragua. The American people are tired of the off-on-again policy in Central America. A bipartisan majority supported aid to the freedom fighters last year. The American people want that aid to continue. And that's why we've got to get the message out. Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors—even your Congressmen and Senators. Let them know how you feel. We've got to get the message out, because there's no question in my mind, when the American people have the facts, they'll support freedom this time and every time.","Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you."]}

Thank you very much, Secretary Perry, Admiral Miller, Admiral Owens, Admiral Flanagan, Admiral Murphy, Captain Gemmill, and to all of you who are here. It's a great honor for me to be here. I asked to see the person responsible for decorating the F-14 with my name and the Vice President's name there. I guess I'm going to have to take flying lessons.","Audience member. He's right here, Mr. [SPEAKER], Skipper Al Myers.","Comdr. Alan Myers. Al Myers, sir.","[SPEAKER]. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I told someone to take a picture of that, and I'm going to take it back to the Vice President when I see him this afternoon and suggest that we both take flying lessons. Admiral Miller said, \"You understand on that plane, you would still control the eject seat.\" And I told him, \"I don't believe in ejecting. I'd never bail out.\" But I was glad to know that.","I thank you all for your service. I'm pleased and honored to be with you today. I understand that some of you have actually chosen to come back from your leave to be a part of this ceremony, and I'm deeply grateful for yet another expression of your devotion to your country. I am proud of the job you have done, proud of the great work that all of our troops are doing in Haiti. And on behalf of the American people, the most important message I have to you today is a simple, straightforward, heartfelt thank you.","I also want to thank, especially, Captain Gemmill and the crew of this magnificent carrier for the \"I Like Ike\" button. You know, you may think that's funny, since he was a Republican and I'm a Democrat, but when I was born, [SPEAKER] Truman was President. But obviously, I was an infant; I didn't have much consciousness of it. President Eisenhower was elected in the year I went to the first grade, so he was the first President I really ever knew anything about. And all of us, regardless of our party, liked Ike. I can still remember when the country was united in a way that it's not now and when political arguments were a little more civil than they tend to be now. President Eisenhower's life of service to our country and his incredible leadership throughout his military career, culminating in his leadership in World War II and of course ultimately in his election to the Presidency, was an inspiration to me and to every other young American and I know is a continuing inspiration to all of you who are privileged to serve on this great carrier and in this group.","Much has been asked of you, and you have delivered. Thanks to your efforts, the Haitian people are moving from fear to freedom. Thanks to your efforts, the democratically elected government will soon return to power. Thanks to your efforts, the world knows that the United States will stand up for human rights and against slaughter, stand up for democracy, honor our commitments, and expect those who make commitments to us to honor them as well. We gave our word, and you, the men and women of the Eisenhower Battle Group, kept the word of the United States. And for that, we are all in your debt.","The stories from Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti have inspired all Americans. We have seen the moving images of Haitians approaching and thanking American troops for their new-found freedom. We have seen the joy in their eyes and the hope in their faces. Operation Uphold Democracy is not over yet, and you know well that it still presents dangers to the men and women of our Armed Forces.","But look what has happened in less than 3 weeks. In less than 3 weeks, you've disarmed FRAPH, the attaches, and the other militia who terrorized thousands of Haitians. In less than 3 weeks, you took heavy weapons away from the military and made the cities and the towns more secure. In less than 3 weeks, you helped 1,900 refugees return home from Guantanamo, no longer afraid for their lives. In less than 3 weeks, you permitted Parliament once again to open its doors for business. And today, they're having a good, old-fashioned debate down there, about like what happens in Congress every day in Washington. In less than 3 weeks, you returned Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul, a man in hiding in his own country for 3 years, back to his office. In less than 3 weeks, you put state radio and television back into the hands of people who want democracy. In less than 3 weeks, you even turned the lights back on in Cap Haitien after 2 years of darkness. In less than 3 weeks, you showed the world what the men and women of the American military can do.","All of us owe these achievements to the fact that you are the best trained, best prepared, best equipped, most highly motivated fighting force in the world. Your reputation preceded you to Haiti. When the military rulers learned that you were on your way, they agreed to step down. The awesome force you represent is the steel in the sword of America's diplomacy.","The success of the mission in Haiti to date also shows how flexible our military has become. Thanks to careful planning by the U.S. Atlantic Command and the joint task force, we were able to quickly recall the massive assault force that was on its way. In its place, and within just hours of reaching agreement with Mr. Cedras and the other military leaders, we sent in troops, carried by the Eisenhower Battle Group, to keep the peace in Haiti.","Operation Uphold Democracy demonstrates the value of mixing our four services together and drawing on the special capabilities of each of them, what Admiral Miller calls adaptive force packaging. You prepared the first-ever infantry air assault from a carrier. Had it not been for such innovation, it would have taken many more hours, if not days, for our troops to be on the ground there. I salute Admiral Miller and the members of his staff who developed this innovative plan, which will change our military planning and make it possible for us to do remarkable things well into the 21st century. You have laid the groundwork for a dramatic forward movement in a military planning and execution. You should be proud, and the Nation owes Admiral Miller and his staff a great deal.","Of course, even the best strategists can only make a difference if they have the resources to do the job. That's why I was pleased yesterday to sign the fiscal year '95 defense authorization bill, which was passed with strong bipartisan support including the support of Virginia's two fine Senators, Chuck Robb and John Warner, and the two able Congressmen from this area, Norm Sisisky and Bobby Scott. This bill will assure that you remain better trained, better equipped, and better prepared than any other military in the world, and I am determined that it will always be that way. [Applause] Thank you. I know that one piece of this defense bill will be especially welcome news for all of you, the $3.6 billion we will spend on a new aircraft carrier, CVN-76. That carrier will be built right here in Norfolk by thousands of hard-working Virginians. Like the Eisenhower, it will give us the capability to project our power around the world, to support peacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions, and, if necessary, to fight and to win regional conflicts.","In 2 weeks, just 2 weeks, you set sail for the Adriatic, to carry on your work of protecting our country's national interests around the world. I know you will demonstrate the same skill and professionalism on this journey that you have shown in Haiti.","In a few moments, I'll have the distinct honor of presenting Navy commendation medals for meritorious service in Haiti to several of you. But I want every one of you to know that in my book, each and every one of you is a medal winner, an example of what is the very best in our country. You serve with distinction, you serve in a selfless way, you serve in a way that will help us to build a peaceful and freer and stronger world for yourselves and your children as we move into the next century, and we are all in your debt.","Men and women of the Ike, you have proved your capabilities time and again. In Haiti, you brought a new day to a people who thought they would never get it. You answered the call; you did the job; your country is proud of you.","Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America."]}

White House complex—that's what they call these buildings. Makes you wonder, can't anything in Washington ever be simple? [Laughter]","Seeing all of you here today is a particular pleasure for me, because together you speak for some of the causes that are closest to my heart, some of the most important reasons our administration came to Washington in the first place.","Some of you are law enforcement officers. Some are civilians who work for victims' rights. Some are fighting obscenity and the unspeakable evil of child pornography. Others are working to prevent drug abuse. In the past 4 or 5 months, I've heard a lot of talk—much of it, to put it most kindly, inaccurate—about our social agenda, particularly as it applies to the courts. Well, if anyone wants to know our true agenda, there's no need to go any farther than this room, because your agenda is our agenda.","I don't need to tell anyone here the sad, often tragic story of years of judicial solicitation for every conceivable right of criminals and neglect for the victims of crime, of playing fast and loose with first amendment rights in a way that gave too many pornographers free rein, of fanciful constitutional arguments used to throw out long and hard police work, and of the price our nation has paid for all of this.","One way, for example, that we've paid that price has been in the wider and wider availability of pornography. The sale of pornography was once said to be victimless. But common sense should have told us all along that pornography has many victims-among them, children. I read a statistic recently that, in a single day, one dial-a-porn company has received 800,000 calls. I'm told that the great proportion of those calls are thought to have been made by children. There's nothing victimless about those children. The time has come for this to stop.","Let me mention here—and I've recently sent Congress a bill that will make it easier for law enforcement officials to fight obscenity and child pornography. But incredible as it may seem, there are well-meaning people who will oppose it. The most extreme say that the first amendment protects child pornographers as they publish and distribute their products. However well-intended, that kind of extremism should not be allowed to prevail. It's not what the Constitution requires. I hope I can count on your support in getting this bill enacted into law. [Applause] I should have known you'd feel that way. [Laughter] By the way, we could also use a boost with our criminal justice reform legislation.","I hope I can count on your support on something else as well, and it's the principal reason that we're here today. I have nominated a judge to the Supreme Court who is realistic about pornography and crime in general: Judge Anthony M. Kennedy.","Judge Kennedy has been on my short list from the very start. A graduate of Stanford University and the Harvard Law School, he has served 12 years on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. There he won the respect of his fellow jurists and the lawyers who practice before that court. He participated in over 1,400 decisions and wrote more than 400 opinions. He earned the reputation for being a balanced and fair judge and one who is tough on crime and concerned about the victims of crime. As he said earlier this year: Victims' \"dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system represents a failure of the system to achieve its goals.\" And then he added: \"The significant criminal law decisions of the Warren Court focused on the relation of the accused to the state, and the police as an instrument of the state. Little or no thought was given to the position of the victims.\" Well, that's a note of compassion and realism that is too often missing in our courts.","Realism runs through all his work on the bench. He argued in one dissent, for example, for a \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule, and saw his position ultimately adopted by the Supreme Court. That was in a drug case, by the way. And for realism about police work, the opinion he wrote in that case sets a high standard. He said, and I'll quote again: \"You don't have to read many cases involving illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly what was going on at the residences described by the officer's affidavit.\" And he concluded: \"Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become compounded unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when the only commonsense explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity.\"","Another example of his realism—last year Judge Kennedy upheld a lower court when it imposed the maximum sentence allowed by law against a child pornographer. His opinion focused on the severe psychological harm victims of child pornography endure and the great likelihood that child pornographers will, when released, commit the same crimes again. We need more realism like that on the Nation's highest court. We need Judge Kennedy on our highest court.","But let me add another thought here. Being tough on crime doesn't require tortured constitutional reasoning. The Constitution itself is tough on crime; it was intended to \"establish justice\" and \"ensure domestic tranquility.\" It provides a system for discovering the truth, releasing the innocent, and punishing the guilty, not for subjecting the police to an endless guessing game about the rules.","Not long ago, I heard about a case that involved a particularly horrible murder and that illustrates just what's too often wrong in our courts. A man threw his girlfriend's 10-month-old child down the trash chute of her ll-story apartment building. He was arrested, tried, and convicted. But the conviction was thrown out on appeal. Citing heavily from U.S. Supreme Court rulings, the State appeals court decided that the man had been denied equal justice under the law, because he was not taken before a court commissioner within 24 hours of arrest. No, he was taken 24 hours and 12 minutes after arrest. So, he's out walking the streets now. We've had enough decisions like that. The Supreme Court sets the tone for all courts in our land, as well as establishing precedence in the Federal judiciary. I hope we'll have your active support as the Senate deliberates on confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court.","And now, I know you've heard a number of people, and you've heard enough from me. So, thank you, and God bless you all."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksannouncingproposedlegislationestablishgibillforchildren","text":["Welcome, all. Hey, we're glad you guys are here. Welcome, welcome, and please be seated. All you kids, welcome to the South Lawn of the White House. And to the Vice President and Mrs. Quayle and Secretary Alexander, a warm welcome. A particularly warm welcome to the Members of Congress, both House and Senate, that are with us today. Welcome to all of you, our very special guests, on this special occasion.","I have just come from a working session in the White House, working with some of the great experts on school choice. The parents, I think, made the most significant contribution to our working session because their dreams for their kids are the same dreams that all of us have. They want their kids to have a first-class education. They know from practical experience that a good education is absolutely essential to making a good living and to making a good life.","So let me just share a little from that meeting. Janette Williams told me about her son, Javon. The Williamses are here with us somewhere here today whoops, here she is over here. Her kid starred on \"60 Minutes,\" and that says something about the guy, if you go on that program and come off in one piece. [Laughter] He must be doing real well. But here's what she said, and this is serious. She said, \"At his old school that was crowded, he used to get so bored that he would walk out. And thanks to the choice program in Milwaukee, he's at a new school. He's not doing those things anymore. He's doing his homework; he's even helping clean up the classroom after school. They took the energy and turned it around.\"","Now, the Governor here, Tommy Thompson, the Governor of Wisconsin, is here with us today. I'm sorry that Polly Williams, who's been at the forefront of the school choice movement, couldn't be here, but she's at home looking after her mother. I would salute her values. But we miss her very, very much. Together, Polly and Tommy Thompson, the Governor, have taken the lead in helping parents like Janette Williams realize her dreams for her son Javon, creating scholarships for 1,000 Milwaukee children from low-income families so that they can attend private schools. Now, theirs is a bold experiment, to give low-income families more of the same choices of schools already available to wealthier families.","Mike Joyce of the Bradley Foundation was also in our meeting. And Bradley recently joined with other foundations and Milwaukee businesses to raise $3 million so that Milwaukee's low-income families will be able to choose their family's schools, including the religious schools. Mike told us this morning that parents picked up every one of the 4,500 scholarship applications the day after the scholarships were announced, 4,500, that fast. And don't let anybody tell you that the people of Milwaukee don't care about their kids' education.","No one should underestimate what's at stake here. A revolution is underway in Milwaukee and across this country, a revolution to make American schools the best in the world. I salute our Secretary of Education who is helping lead that revolution, Lamar Alexander.","Together with the Nation's Governors, we've set six ambitious national education goals. And I might say that this wasn't a partisan move; Democrats and Republicans alike of the Governors coming together to set six ambitious national education goals. In 44 States and 1,400 communities, we've already launched America 2000 to meet these goals.","Even earlier still, in January 1989, just before I was sworn in as [SPEAKER], we helped organize the White House Conference on Choice in Education. We believed then and we believe today a few fundamental truths. We believe that parents are their children's first teachers. Parents, not bureaucrats, know what's best for their kids.","At this point I would like to salute one of the two in purple, Barbara Bush for her pointing this out to parents, that it's what they do, what happens in their home. Barbara's done a lot of that here and around the country. I might say that Marilyn Quayle's taking that same message of parental involvement all across our country, and we're very grateful to her.","So, it is our belief then that parents, not the Government, should choose their children's schools. So today I am proposing that we take another giant step forward in this revolution. I am sending to Congress legislation that would authorize an ambitious demonstration program, half a billion new Federal dollars to help communities all across America give $1,000 scholarships to children of middle- and low-income families so they can choose which schools their kids will attend.","This revolution is in the greatest American tradition. We've done it before, and it's worked. Forty-eight years ago this very week, President Roosevelt signed the GI bill, creating scholarships that veterans could use at any college, any college of their choice. The GI bill created opportunity for Americans who never would have had it, and in doing so it helped create the best system of colleges and universities in the world.","Now we can do that again, this time by helping State and local governments and we're delighted the Mayor of Milwaukee is with us here today this time by helping State and local governments create the best elementary and secondary schools in the world. The \"GI bill\" for children will help. It'll provide that help to these families. These dollars to spend at the schools of their choice will become the muscle that parents need to create the best schools for their kids.","Let me say to those who will attack our school choice initiative on the ground that it permits Government money to go to religious schools, you're wrong. I believe those critics are wrong. This is aid to the families, not aid to institutions. And again, if you set the clock back to the creation of that original GI bill, no one told the GI's that they couldn't go to S.M.U. or Notre Dame or Yeshiva or Howard. I haven't heard Members of Congress suggest that students stop using Pell grants and guaranteed student loans at Baptist colleges or Presbyterian seminaries. I don't hear an outcry because poor children at Catholic schools get their lunch paid for by Federal taxpayers. In the same way, parents must be free to use this money at the school they believe will best teach their child, whether the school is public, private, or religious. Let me try to be clear on this point: Accepting students with vouchers does not mean a school must sacrifice school prayer.","And let me say this to those who stand against extending school choice to low- and middle-income families: I simply do not buy the idea that someone cannot make a good decision just because that person is poor. We heard the same argument when we proposed child care vouchers for low-income families or when we proposed help for public housing tenants to own their own homes. So it's my belief that we ought to let families own their own home and choose their own schools regardless of their income level and give them help. Give them a shot at the American dream, if you will.","Finally, to those who claim that school choice will hurt the public schools, let me underscore this point: All of this new money can go to public schools if that's where the child chooses to go, where the family chooses to have the kid go. That decision will be in the hands of families, where it belongs.","There are several points to make about money. First, I want to make it clear that we're not talking here about a new Federal entitlement program. The Federal Government cannot afford one more entitlement, even for education. I've said many times that money alone isn't the answer. The United States already spends more per student for schools than any country in the world except Switzerland. I don't have to tell you where we stand in the international rankings of educational performance at the level we're talking about here today. Our universities and colleges are respected and have achieved the highest levels of achievement. But that, unfortunately, is not true as we talk about K through 12. So we need a revolution in American education, not more money to do it the same old way.","Investment in our schools will remain a primarily State and local responsibility. But Federal support for State and local scholarships can be a catalyst. For schools that attract choice students, it will give teachers and principals a welcome source of new funds. For our children, choice can help open up opportunities, create genuine change in our schools.","For too long, we've shielded schools from competition, allowed our schools a damaging monopoly power over our children. This monopoly turns students into statistics and turns parents into pawns. It is time we began thinking of a system of public education in which many providers offer a marketplace of opportunities, opportunities that give all of our children choices and access to the best education in the world. And so it is our firm belief, it is our firm belief that this \"GI bill\" for children will move America inevitably in that direction.","Abraham Lincoln once said, \"Revolutions do not go backward.\" Milwaukee is not the only place in America that our revolution is underway. Last year in Indianapolis, Pat Rooney and the Educational CHOICE Charitable Trust began to offer tuition vouchers to Indianapolis students. I understand a bus-load of parents and students drove all night to be here today. If you're still awake, welcome, a special welcome to all of you. In San Antonio, the CEO Foundation has earmarked $1.5 million in vouchers for children in their community. California: Joe Alibrandi and thousands of supporters are pushing for a ballot initiative to provide voucher scholarships for every school-age child in the State. Overall in 1991, 10 States approved some form of new choice legislation, and 37 States had choice legislation pending in one form or another.","I've been told that there may just be a few folks here from Pennsylvania. [Applause] We're outnumbered. Well, it may take a few tries, but I never underestimate the persistence of parents: The children of Pennsylvania will have school choice.","From California to East Harlem, from coast to coast, the leaders of the school choice movement are sparking a revolution in American education. They're the true heroes of this education reform, and some of them are here with us today. They aren't afraid to stand up to the status quo, to say loud and clear that when it comes to educating our kids, business-as-usual simply isn't good enough. Let there be no mistake: Barbara and I and the Vice President and Marilyn, and certainly our Secretary, are very proud to stand with you.","You see, this revolution will succeed. It will succeed because it draws its strength from the very heart of the American creed. We have no truth more enduring than the idea that every American should have the opportunity for a first-class education. We have no principles more important than freedom, opportunity, and choice.","So thank you very, very much. And look at it this way, you're doing the Lord's work for our Nation's future, and you're doing it for the young people of this country. We are grateful to all of you. And may God bless the United States. And now I will sign this legislation."]}

I welcome you all here, those who have been introduced and distinguished Members of Congress and military leaders, veterans, others who are in the audience.","Today I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with Vietnam.","From the beginning of this administration, any improvement in relationships between America and Vietnam has depended upon making progress on the issue of Americans who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. Last year, I lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost Americans and to determine the fate of those whose remains have not been found.","It has worked. In 17 months, Hanoi has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. Twenty-nine families have received the remains of their loved ones and at last have been able to give them a proper burial. Hanoi has delivered to us hundreds of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to Americans in Vietnam. And Hanoi has stepped up its cooperation with Laos, where many Americans were lost. We have reduced the number of socalled discrepancy cases, in which we have had reason to believe that Americans were still alive after they were lost, to 55. And we will continue to work to resolve more cases.","Hundreds of dedicated men and women are working on all these cases, often under extreme hardship and real danger in the mountains and jungles of Indochina. On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank them. And I want to pay a special tribute to General John Vessey, who has worked so tirelessly on this issue for [SPEAKER]s Reagan and Bush and for our administration. He has made a great difference to a great many families. And we as a nation are grateful for his dedication and for his service. Thank you, sir.","I also want to thank the [SPEAKER]ial delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Hershel Gober, Winston Lord, James Wold, who have helped us to make so much progress on this issue. And I am especially grateful to the leaders of the families and the veterans organizations who have worked with the delegation and maintained their extraordinary commitment to finding the answers we seek.","Never before in the history of warfare has such an extensive effort been made to resolve the fate of soldiers who did not return. Let me emphasize, normalization of our relations with Vietnam is not the end of our effort. From the early days of this administration I have said to the families and veterans groups what I say again here: We will keep working until we get all the answers we can. Our strategy is working. Normalization of relations is the next appropriate step. With this new relationship we will be able to make more progress. To that end, I will send another delegation to Vietnam this year. And Vietnam has pledged it will continue to help us find answers. We will hold them to that pledge.","By helping to bring Vietnam into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful Vietnam in a stable and peaceful Asia. We will begin to normalize our trade relations with Vietnam, whose economy is now liberalizing and integrating into the economy of the Asia-Pacific region. Our policy will be to implement the appropriate United States Government programs to develop trade with Vietnam consistent with U.S. law.","As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. We have already begun discussing human rights issues with Vietnam, especially issues regarding religious freedom. Now we can expand and strengthen that dialog. The Secretary of State will go to Vietnam in August where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our POW and MIA concerns.","I believe normalization and increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam, just as it did in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I strongly believe that engaging the Vietnamese on the broad economic front of economic reform and the broad front of democratic reform will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in Vietnam.","I am proud to be joined in this view by distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war. They served their country bravely. They are of different parties. A generation ago they had different judgments about the war which divided us so deeply. But today they are of a single mind. They agree that the time has come for America to move forward on Vietnam. All Americans should be grateful especially that Senators John McCain, John Kerry, Bob Kerrey, Chuck Robb, and Representative Pete Peterson, along with other Vietnam veterans in the Congress, including Senator Harkin, Congressman Kolbe, and Congressman Gilchrest, who just left, and others who are out here in the audience have kept up their passionate interest in Vietnam but were able to move beyond the haunting and painful past toward finding common ground for the future. Today they and many other veterans support the normalization of relations, giving the opportunity to Vietnam to fully join the community of nations and being true to what they fought for so many years ago.","Whatever we may think about the political decisions of the Vietnam era, the brave Americans who fought and died there had noble motives. They fought for the freedom and the independence of the Vietnamese people. Today the Vietnamese are independent, and we believe this step will help to extend the reach of freedom in Vietnam and, in so doing, to enable these fine veterans of Vietnam to keep working for that freedom.","This step will also help our own country to move forward on an issue that has separated Americans from one another for too long now. Let the future be our destination. We have so much work ahead of us. This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds. They have resisted time for too long. We can now move on to common ground. Whatever divided us before let us consign to the past. Let this moment, in the words of the Scripture, be a time to heal and a time to build.","Thank you all, and God bless America."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksappliedmaterialsincaustintexas","text":["Hello, Austin! How you doing? Well, it is wonderful to see all of you here today. First of all, give Nicole an outstanding round of applause for the great job that she did.","It is wonderful to be here at Applied Materials. I want to thank Mike and everybody who helped out hosting us and a wonderful tour of the facility. It was incredible. Rick was showing me some of your clean rooms where you are building the equipment that makes the chips that is basically powering that's basically powering everything that you guys are taking pictures with right now. [Laughter] Smartphones, computers, iPads, laptops. And it is just remarkable to see. Every time I walk through these kinds of facilities, I'm thinking: now, this is just magic. I don't know how they do it.","Somebody was explaining to me that I guess one of the wafers was being cleaned, and he said, this would be the equivalent it was Alex who told me this; Alex is around here somewhere—the equivalent of, if you were mowing the South Lawn, but every blade of grass was exactly cut at the same height within a single human hair. That's how precise things are. That sounds pretty precise to me. And if that's, by the way, the precision that you operate on, if that's how you define a clean room, then Sasha and Malia are going to have to step up their game at home.  Because it is not that clean. ","I want to thank your Mayor, Lee Leffingwell, and—who's doing a great job. Lee is doing outstanding work every day and helping to bring the Austin community together. Congressman Lloyd Doggett is here. They've been great hosts. We actually have a special guest: The Mayor of San Antonio in the house, my friend Julian Castro is here.","Now, I've spent the day in Austin talking with folks about what we can do to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a thriving, rising middle class and a dynamic, cutting-edge economy. That's our priority. That should be Washington's top priority. And I see three things that we need to focus on to do it.","Number one, we've got to make America a magnet for good jobs. Number two, we've got to help people earn the skills they need to do those jobs. Number three, we've got to make sure people's hard work is rewarded so that they can make a decent living doing those jobs.","And if you watch the news sometimes, you may think that there's just doom and gloom out there. But the truth is, there's incredible stuff going on all across America and right here in Austin that I think can be good models for the rest of America to follow.","This morning I visited Manor New Tech High School where students are learning high-tech skills that companies like Applied are looking for right now. They are getting excited, working with math and science and technology and engineering. And it's a hands-on high school, where subjects are integrated and kids are building things and conducting experiments at very early ages. And it's sparking their imagination in ways that may lead them to start up the next Applied or come here and work at Applied.","And then I joined a few local families for lunch to talk about how we can make sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and raise a family, with health care that you can count on and the chance to put away some money for retirement. And we also had good barbecue which is necessary for economic growth. [Laughter] Some good barbecue once in a while. And then I came to Applied Materials to talk about what we can do to make America a magnet for new jobs in manufacturing.","And after shedding jobs for a decade, our manufacturers have added now about 500,000 new manufacturing jobs over the past 3 years.  That's good news. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan, and Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And after placing plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. This year, Apple started making Macs in America again.","So there are some good trend lines there, but we've got to do everything we can to strengthen that trend. We've got to do everything we can to help the kind of high-tech manufacturing that you're doing right here at Applied. And we want to make sure it takes root here in Austin and all across the country. And that means, first of all, creating more centers of high-tech manufacturing.","Last year, we launched our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio, to develop new technologies and equip workers with the skills required to master 3-D printing techniques. And in my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to set up 15 more of these manufacturing hubs all across America, and I said that my administration was going to go ahead and move forward with three new hubs on our own, even without congressional action.","Well, today we're launching a competition for those hubs. We are looking for businesses and universities that are willing to partner together to help their region help turn their region into global centers of high-tech jobs. Because we want the next revolution in manufacturing to be made in America.  We're going to do that.","The truth is, over the past couple decades, too many communities have been hit hard when plants closed down and jobs dried up. The economy obviously is changing all the time. Nobody knows that better than folks here at Applied. I was talking to somebody who's after showing me the wafer and some chips, and then they showed me a smartphone, they pointed to the smartphone, and they said, 40 years ago, there'd be about $3 billion just trying to get this much computing power in this little thing, except it would fill up a whole room.","And so the economy is dynamic. Technology is constantly changing. That means we've got to adapt as well. And even as we're working to reverse the trend of communities that have been hard hit with old manufacturing leaving, we've got to propose partnerships with local leaders in manufacturing communities to help attract new investment in the infrastructure and the research that will attract new jobs and new businesses so that communities that have been knocked down can get back up and get back on their feet.","And we should help our workers get the training they need to compete for the industries of tomorrow. No job in America should go unfilled just because we don't have anybody with the right skills. And that's a priority. Now, some of your colleagues that I met, some of them have advanced degrees. Some of them came to apply basically right out of high school. But all of you, whether it was in some cases through a university education, in some cases the military, in some cases just on-the-job training, all of you have specialized skills that are exactly what we need to continue to grow our economy. But we've got a whole bunch of folks out there who don't have those skills, either because the education system failed them or because their skills have been rendered obsolete.","And that's why I want to rethink how our high school kids are prepared. I want to make sure that we're training 2 million Americans at our community colleges for skills that will lead directly to a job. We and that's also why we've got to make sure that college is affordable and people aren't burdened by a mountain of debt so that they can continue to upgrade their skills as well.","Now, if we want to manufacture the best products, we've also got to invest in and cultivate the best ideas. All right? Innovation, ingenuity, that's the constant of the American economy. That's one of the constants of our character. It's what keeps America on the cutting edge.","And just before I came here, I visited the Capital Factory, which, as some of you know, is a place that helps startups take off. And everywhere you turn, somebody has got a new idea. They're all thinking big. They're taking risks. It's exciting.","There was a young woman who is in a wheelchair and physically disabled, but is just incredibly inspired to make sure that she's not in any way confined by that situation. And she's basically designed and is now manufacturing a car that people in wheelchairs can just drive their wheelchair right into the car and start driving.","And then you had a young man who had a 3-D camera it was about this big and basically from filming either a static image or in the round, can basically download that immediately and create a 3-D image and then use that for 3-D manufacturing 3-D printing and manufacturing. And what currently costs about $80,000, costs about $3,000 the technology that he's developed. So they're doing amazing stuff.","And one of the things we're doing to fuel more inventiveness like this to fuel more private sector innovation and discoveryis to make the vast amounts of America's data open and easy to access for the first time in history. So talented entrepreneurs are doing some pretty amazing stuff with data that's already being collected by Government.","So over at the Capital Factory, I met with folks behind the startup called Stormpulse, which uses Government data on weather to help businesses anticipate disruptions in service. And then you've got a Virginia company called Opower, that's used Government data on trends in energy use to save its customers $200 million on their energy bills. There's an app called iTriage, founded by a pair of ER doctors that uses data from the Department of Health and Human Services to help users understand medical symptoms and find local doctors and health care providers.","And today I'm announcing that we're making even more Government data available and we're making it easier for people to find and to use. And that's going to help launch more startups. It's going to help launch more businesses. Some of them undoubtedly will be using this data powered by chips that essentially started right here at Applied Materials. It's going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we haven't even imagined yet.","This kind of innovation and ingenuity has the potential to transform the way we do almost everything. One-third of jobs in Austin are now supported by the tech sector. And we should do all that we can to encourage this kind of innovation economy all across America, in ways that produce new jobs and new opportunities for the middle class.","And we're poised for a time of progress if we're willing to seize it. Not even 5 years after the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, our jobs market and our housing market are steadily healing. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in decades. The American auto industry has made a comeback; it's thriving. American energy is booming. But we've got to keep on moving forward, and we've got to make sure that Washington is not administering self-inflicted wounds when we're making progress.","So Mike and I were talking about the fact that if we can reform our tax system to eliminate some of these loopholes, potentially, we could lower some rates. That would make our businesses more competitive.","Basic research, you'll hear people talk about how government is not going to do anything for us. Well, we all understand that the private sector powers and drives our economy. On the other hand, most of the private sector right now has a lot of trouble financing basic research. And that basic research is the foundation for everything that's done at this company, and everything that's done for most of your customers. And we can't afford to fall behind when it comes to basic research. So there's some key things that we can do that shouldn't be ideological. They're not Democratic ideas or Republican ideas or Independent ideas, they're just good ideas that allow the government to help create the foundation, the platform, the environment in which companies like Applied Materials can thrive. And that's what we've got to constantly champion.","And when you're talking to your Members of Congress or you're talking to elected officials, you've got to remind them we don't want government to do everything for us, but it's got a role to play on infrastructure, basic research, making sure that we've got a fair a tax system that's fair, making sure that we've got some basic stability in our budget so people aren't always guessing what's going to happen around the corner.","Think about how this company was built. Back in 1967, when Applied Materials was just getting off the ground, there were five employees. They worked out of this small industrial unit in California. And I suppose they had a clean room in there, but I don't know what it looked like. [Laughter] But what they lacked in size, they made up with ingenuity and imagination and risk-taking. And over the years, as you grew to become a leader in high-tech manufacturing, that ingenuity never faltered. Whether you've been with this company for decades as I know some of you have or just for a year, you're all focused on the future. Every day, you're pushing the limits of technology a little bit further.","And you're not alone, because somewhere over at the Capital Factory, there's an entrepreneur mapping out a new product on a whiteboard that may be the next big thing. Somewhere over at Manor New Tech High School, there's a kid scribbling down an idea for a new invention that one day may turn into an entirely new industry. That's America.","And when you look out across this room, what you also notice is there's talent drawn from every segment of our society. We don't care what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is. We just want to make sure we're all working together to create a better future for our kids.","That's America. We innovate. And we adapt. We move forward. That's what Austin is all about. That's what's going on in this city. And that's what I want to keep on promoting as your [SPEAKER] of the United States of America.","Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America."]}

And I congratulate the New York Daily News for caring enough about its community that it sponsors the New York Crime Fighters Award program. I understand that more than $60,000 in those prize moneys that Mr. Wieghart mentioned have been given out so far, and that's quite an investment in our collective peace of mind.","By working together, the city and the Daily News are another example of how our public and private institutions can be made even more effective in improving the quality of our lives. But most of all, I want to thank these citizens here for—they're everyday Americans—thank them for their courage in unexpected circumstances and for their becoming heroes they were. You know, someone once said that a hero isn't braver than anyone else. He's just brave 5 minutes longer. [Laughter] I don't know whether that's the answer or not, but God bless them all.","And those who say we're in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look. They certainly haven't been flipping through the pages of the New York Daily News lately. I wish all our people could read, as I have, the accounts of your individual acts of heroism. In each case you seem to think you acted as anyone else would have in the same situation. And you spoke from your hearts about how we all depend on one another.","Alvin Torres said, \"I just hope people will realize that we must all work together, citizens and police. If somebody needs help, we should try to help out. You've got to try.\" Well, when you read how the Torres brothers chased down a purse-snatcher wielding a knife; how Mrs. Keneally, a grandmother, collared a pickpocket by his neck scarf and gave him the back of her hand until the police arrived—I liked the picture of that one more than anything- [laughter] —and how Rabbi Rosenfeld immobilized a mugger armed with a machete; you realize there's nothing very average about the average American.","Sometimes I've accused some of our political opponents of referring so much about the common man, and I prefer to think that most Americans are pretty uncommon. Here in New York's teeming streets and boroughs and in towns and cities across America, our people do care about each other. And they're ready to help. From cabbies to construction workers to youths to grandmothers and an airman from Brooklyn, the people of New York are leading the way in what has become a national citizens campaign to restore security to our streets and neighborhoods. Working with their local police, they're getting results.","Seeing men and women like yourselves here today in what some say is the busiest precinct in the county—or in the country, I should say, I believe we can and we will rid ourselves of the fear that plagued us. I like to think, also, that we're not only going to rid ourselves of the fear; we're going to transfer that fear to where those skulking people who try to take advantage of their fellow citizens aren't going to just look around for the uniform. They're just going to look around and say, \"I can't trust these people anymore, can't trust them to go their own way and not take us on.\"","Together we're working toward the day when law-abiding men and women can live in confidence and, as I say, only the criminals will be afraid.","On behalf of all Americans, I thank the New York Crime Fighters. I thank the Daily News and New York City. I'll tell your story wherever I go, because I know your courage will inspire others. In the meantime, your fellow citizens are grateful that you've made the world a little safer, a little more free, and filled with a great deal more hope.","I want to congratulate you on your awards and, again, thank you for your courage.

I want to say a special word of appreciation to Ray Lesniak because it's his birthday tonight, so I know we're all glad .","I want to thank Senator Lautenberg for what he said and for what he's done in Washington, for standing up especially for the environment under a period of incredibly intense assault from the majority in Congress. Yes, you ought to clap for him because he did that.","And as he leaves the United States Senate, I'd like to thank Senator Bradley for his 18 years of service to New Jersey and to America, for many, many years of friendship, counsel, and advice to me, and for the support that he gave this administration in the last 3 1/2 years. I know we all wish him well, and we know that the next chapter of his life will doubtless be just as exciting as the ones that have gone before. Thank you very much, Bill, and God bless you.","You know, there have been a lot of sort of asides tonight about why Congressman Torricelli is not here. I think he is here for you, because he's down there voting on something you care about. And I have a message for those if there was some designed effort to keep him from coming up here tonight, guess what? He's still going to get the contributions, and we still know where he is, and we know what's at stake, and we're going to elect him in November, so it doesn't make any difference.","One thing you know about Bob Torricelli is that he will stand up and fight for you with every fiber of his being. He doesn't do anything halfway; he is full of passion. He will fight for the water you drink, the land you live on, the air you breathe, the education of your children, the safety of your streets, and the example of your country as a beacon of freedom and democracy.","He's been leading the fight to protect Sterling Forest here, the watershed for most of northern New Jersey. He wrote a section of the Superfund act that is focused on the chemical sites that are polluted here, something I am determined to see us finish the work on and another reason I don't want to see any further attempts to erode our investment in environmental protection. Bob Torricelli will protect all that.","So I ask you to do what you can for the next 6 months to send Bob Torricelli to the United States Senate. Bill Bradley's shoes may be impossible to fill, but the people of New Jersey deserve someone fighting for them who is on their side and fighting for their future, not someone in the grip of an ideological theory that will only undermine our ability to go forward together. So I ask you again, do what you can, send him to the Senate. Do what you can for yourselves and your children and your future. We need Bob Torricelli, and I'm going to depend on you to deliver New Jersey for us.","Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to keep you a long time tonight, but I want to just give a speech that in some ways is not particularly political. And after, I'm going to ask you to do something that is intensely political. Usually these fundraisers we all know that our political system wouldn't work without them, but a lot of times I think you come and go and you have your blood stirred, but I wonder if, when you leave, you think you have done your part and that's all there is to it.","I want to talk to you tonight about what I believe is really going on in this country now, what I think is really at stake in this election, and why I hope you believe your financial contributions are only the beginning of your responsibilities as citizens for the next 6 months.","We are clearly living through a time of change as profound as any the United States has endured in a hundred years in terms of the ways we work and live. Every so often our country is confronted with huge challenges, either to our very existence or at least to the ideals with which we started, that all of us are created equal and that we have inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the Government is instituted to promote the general, the common welfare.","We had a lot of trouble getting started in working that out. Then we had to fight a great Civil War to hold the country together and to redeem the promise of equality by extending it when it had to be extended. And then, 100 years ago, we faced a period of change rather like today, when we moved from the farm to the factory, from the country to the city. There were vast new opportunities, but there was a lot of uprooting; a lot of people's lives were dislocated. And the progressive era began, with Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson saying that the power of the United States Government should be used to curb the abuses of that era and to make sure its benefits could be extended to all Americans. They had the antitrust laws, the child laws, the environment protection laws, all designed to let us have the benefits of the new industrial age without being broken by it, without having our identity as a nation, our character as a people, our ideals as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution savaged. That's what it was all about.","And then we underwent the Depression and World War II, and President Roosevelt and the Congress and the leaders of that time had to, first of all, defeat the opponents of freedom who would have killed our way of life beyond our borders and rally the American people to overcome that profound Depression and find a way to build a safety net under this country so that we could manage our economy in ways that didn't permit it to crash again and break the lives of so many millions of people.","Then we had to gird ourselves for the cold war, which we did, and wait for our victory to come, because communism was always founded on a total misunderstanding of human nature and the human condition.","Now we are going through another period of change, economic and social change and the way we relate to the rest of the world, sort of like what happened 100 years ago. Now we've moved from a cold-war world to a global society, not just a global economy. Now we've moved from an industrial age to one in which all work is dominated by information and technology and has vast ramifications which New Jersey has felt for the organization of work: big companies dramatically downsizing; new companies starting at a rapid rate; a lot of people doing exceedingly well; other people left behind; other people feeling uncertain about their future.","When I ran for [INTERVIEWED] in 1992, I got into that race because I was convinced we could no longer just sit by and let it happen, that we needed an aggressive response. And I said then what I repeat to you now: I still believe our vision for the future should be animated by three things:","One, the desire to give the American dream of opportunity to every person in this country without regard to their race, their gender, their station in life, where they live, and what they're up against. That ought to be the first thing.","Two, the understanding that we cannot achieve that in the world in which we are living unless we find a way to come together to respect our diversity, to bridge all those gaps of race and religion and region and ethnicity. This country now has, more or less, 200 different racial and ethnic groups. It's an astonishing thing that we can find ways to come together around our core values and our respect for one another's differences. And I am sick and tired of seeing elections used as wedges to divide people one from another, to try to get people who are in the majority to look down on those who aren't, and then hope we can pick up the pieces after the election. We should be uniting the American people and going forward together.","And the third thing we have to do is continue to be the world's greatest force for peace and freedom and prosperity. And as I have said many times, that sounds great and everybody is for that in general, but often in particular they're not.","When I took the action I did in Haiti and Bosnia, in becoming the first President to try to do something in Northern Ireland, all of the things we have done in the Middle East, what all the polls said was the most unpopular decision of my administration, trying to keep Mexico from collapsing, everything I did, I did because I know that our country has got to try to be the world's greatest source of energy for peace and freedom and prosperity, and because I know that 20 years from now we can be the strongest country in the world, but others will grow stronger, and we have to work with Russia, we have to work with China, we have to work with a uniting Europe, we have to work with emerging countries, to have them define their greatness in a way that helps us all to go forward in peace and prosperity.","How will these other countries define their greatness? Will it be as we do, by how well they educate their people and what their economic achievements are and what their cultural achievements are and whether they can help their less fortunate neighbors? Or will it be by whether they can bully people just because they are smaller than they are? This a big issue. We cannot walk away from this. You cannot live in the world we are going toward and pretend to stay within your own borders.","So that's what I tried to do in 1992. And ever since I have been in this office, everything I have done can be explained in terms of either trying to create opportunity or to bring us together around our basic values and respecting our diversity or maintaining our leadership for peace and freedom. And you heard Senator Lautenberg talking about it. It is true that we are better off today than we were 4 years ago, 8 1/2 million jobs better off. The deficit is less than half of what it was. The crime rate is down. The welfare rolls are down. We are moving in the right direction. That is true.","It is also true that there are a lot of challenges out there. In the economic arena, we have at least three big challenges, don't we? In New Jersey, you know what one of them is. We have to figure out what to do about all these people who get downsized from big companies but who still have a lot of good years left. And we're working on that. In the next few days, I'm going to have a lot of companies in the country come in, and we're going to highlight the companies that have been able to avoid that and have been able to do things that really help their employees if they have to leave.","We have got to find a way, secondly, to give all of our working people a greater sense of economic security. I have heard Senator Bradley talk about this. If you can't guarantee somebody the same job with the same company for a lifetime, then they have to know if they work hard and play by the rules, they will always be able to get new training for new work, they will always have access to health care, and they will always be able to have a pension they can carry around with them, even if they change jobs. They have to be able to know that.","And lastly, we have to remember that here in New Jersey and throughout this country, in spite of the 8 1/2 million jobs, there are vast expanses within our inner cities and in our rural areas that have not felt any new investment opportunity. And don't kid yourself, when you have new jobs and growth, you also drive down the welfare rolls, you drive down the crime rate, you drive down the despair that people feel. So we have to find a way to bring free enterprise back to the inner cities and back to the rural areas of America. I know we can do it. If we can do it for other countries, we can do it for our own.","If you look at this great country of ours, and you ask, how can we come together instead of be driven apart, you have to start with our basic values. We need to build up families and the integrity and strength of childrearing, not tear it down. That's why I've said many times, I'm all for welfare reform that's tough on work if people can work, but I don't want to hurt the children. We should be supportive of good parenting and work. All of us try to succeed as workers and parents. That's what we should want poor people to do, too. Everybody should be able to succeed in that way. That should be our goal.","We have to create an educational system that gives everybody genuine opportunity. And that means, among other things, what I was doing here in New Jersey a couple of weeks ago, which is ensuring that we hook up every classroom and every library, even in the poorest schools in America, to the information superhighway in the next 4 years. We can do that, and we can revolutionize education if we do it.","We have got to continue our work to lower the crime rate by having more police on the street, more prevention strategies, being tough in keeping the assault weapons ban in the Brady bill and not giving them up, and by actually doing something to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to. We can bring the crime rate down; we can make our streets safe again; we can make our neighborhoods whole again. We know how to do it. The question is whether we will.","We have to continue this fight to protect the environment. It is woefully short-sighted to believe that we can walk away from our obligations to clean up the messes we've made and protect ourselves from making further ones and gain anything economically by it. Yes, we have to find smarter ways to do it. Our administration has worked hard to find ways to grow the economy and clean the environment. But if we walk away from that, we will not go into the 21st century as a country that is stronger with stronger families and stronger communities and a stronger future. All of these things we must do.","We have to keep working and reaching out to the rest of the world, even when it's frustrating, when there are no easy answers. And to do it, we have to have an idea of Government that is fundamentally different from that embraced by the congressional majority. If you listen to them, what they say is, Government is the source of all of our problems; this new world is going to be so wonderful; if we could just get Government out of the way, all of our problems would be solved; what we need is empowerment defined as more choice and freedom from Government.","If you listen to our crowd, what do we say? We're not for big Government anymore where it's not necessary. Just remember, folks, when election time comes, they bad-mouth the Government, but we're the ones that reduced it. It's 240,000 smaller today than it was the day I became [INTERVIEWED]. But we did it in a way that treated those Federal workers with dignity. We gave them generous early retirement packages and severance packages and time to find other jobs. And we didn't try to make some big thing out of it. We just did it because it needed to be done. But we believe that there is a different sort of empowerment. We believe that real opportunity means not only choice but the ability to exercise the choice.","You remember the great French writer Anatole France said the rich and poor are equally free to sleep under the bridge at night. Now, that's what choice is without the capacity to exercise it. We believe our job in Washington is to give people the ability to make the most of their own lives as individuals, workers, as citizens, in families, in communities, and as citizens of this great Nation. That's what we believe, the power to make the most of their own lives. We cannot guarantee results for people, but if we don't make sure everybody has got a chance to do the most that they can with their lives and live out their dreams, this country will never be what it ought to be in the 21st century. That is the main choice you face in 1996.","And let me say, in terms of the election, why you have to work at it. This is a complicated time. There is a lot of kind of paradox out there. And you have to talk to people about what the nature of this time is, what the nature of this period of change is, and what should we be doing. And every one of you who can afford to be here tonight has a voice, a mind, a spirit that can be brought to bear on your friends and neighbors. And you need to take this opportunity to use this election as elections should always be used, as a genuine educational opportunity to learn about where we are. And every question then becomes, how do we do this in a way that gives everybody a chance to make the most of their own lives? How do we do this in a way that brings the American people together and doesn't divide them? How do we do this in a way that maintains our leadership in the world for peace and freedom?","So it is not a question of whether we balance the budget. We have reduced the deficit more than our predecessors. The question is, how we balance the budget, not whether we do it. So in every case, I ask you to think about this. And you're quite fortunate now, you don't have to guess. You don't have to guess. You know what the choices are. You can look at the budget of 1995, which I vetoed, at the environmental initiatives, at the differences between us. And you don't have to guess.","Who is right about family and medical leave? Were we right to say that you shouldn't lose your job if you've got to take a little time off when a baby is born or a parent is sick or a child is in the hospital? Or were they? We said yes, and they said no. We now have gotten a bipartisan study of the family and medical leave law that says one in six American workers covered by the law have taken advantage of it, and about 90 percent of the businesses say it didn't cost them any money to comply and didn't cause them any problems.","I think that's what we're about. All we did was to empower people to succeed at work and at home. That's what we should be doing. I think we were right.","Were we right? Were we right to fight for the 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill? Were we right? I believe we were. All I know is that the crime rate is down all across America now for 3 or 4 years in a row because of more police and prevention. All I know is that no lawful hunter has lost his or her weapon, but there are 60,000 people who did lose their weapons, the 60,000 people with criminal records who tried to buy a handgun and couldn't do it because of the Brady bill in the last year and a half.","Were we right to fight for national service, to give people a chance to serve their community, solve the problems, work with people of different backgrounds, and earn some money to go to college, or were they right to say that's a luxury we can't afford? Were we right to change the student loan laws so that more people could borrow money to go to college on better terms and pay it back as a percentage of their income so that if you have a high tuition cost but you want to be a schoolteacher, a police officer, a nurse, or somebody else doing public service and you know you're not going to be rich, you still can always borrow the money to go to college, and you can still always pay it back? I believe we were right about that.","And in every case, there was no big Government guarantee. All we were trying to do was to give people the means to make the most of their own lives, to seize the American dream, to come together instead of being divided, to stand up for the things we believe in around the world. That's all we did, and it makes all the difference.","So I say to you, this is not like 1992 when the question was the status quo or change. There is no status quo option. There are two very different views of change. They can be well-known and completely understood. The question is, which road will you walk into the 21st century? And I tell you, I see pictures in my mind all the time that give me the answer.","The other day I was at Eastern High School in Washington, DC, where all of the students are African-American except the Russian exchange students, a program you've done a lot of work on. There they were, reaching for unity over diversity. There they were, struggling to come out of poverty. There they were, asking not for a guarantee, but just for a good education and a chance at the American dream. And if I've got anything to do about it, they're going to get it. That's what they're going to get.","I got two letters from two married couples I got to know not very long ago because they had desperately sick children. I know as the father of only one child, there must be no greater pain in the world than having a child die before you do. And both these couples lost their children, but they got to be good parents because of the family and medical leave law that they helped us fight for. I think we were right, and I think that's the kind of change we want.","I got a letter that I signed today back to a man who is now in his mid-sixties who lost a job 4 years ago at an aerospace plant, didn't know where to turn. But he wrote us, and because we found him the kind of training program that others are trying to eliminate, that man started his life over again in his early sixties and is working again and has dignity and is supporting himself and his family. That's what I believe we ought to be doing.","This is not complicated. It is not about big Government programs. It is not about yesterday's ideas. This is about which road we will walk into the future. It is about whether we will walk it together.","Today in Woodbridge, basically your good anybody here from there? I was over there today at the high school. We were at the high school; Senator Lautenberg talked about it. We did this antismoking program. And I was talking to the mayor on the way in about what kind of community it was. He said, it's sort of a standard New Jersey blue-collar community, and it was. It was, except they had not only Christians and Jews among the student body, they had Hindus and Muslims among the student body, even there.","America is changing. I'm telling you, this business of trying to drive a stake between people in this country based on their race, their ethnic background, or their religion has got to stop. We have got to stop it. We have got to stop it. Now, you don't have to guess about this; look around the rest of the world. Which road do you want to walk into the future? And I know that either I or my successors will make some mistakes in our judgments about what the United States should do around the world. But basically, it is right for us to continue to reach out to other countries. It is right for us to support peace and freedom and to try to expand our own prosperity by expanding that of others. It is right for us to be partners with other countries, even when we're tired and we want to lay our burdens down, because it's the only way to fight terrorism, the only way to fight drug dealing, the only way to fight organized crime; it is right to do that. So you get to decide about that, which road will you walk into the future.","And I want to ask you when you leave here tonight to think about what else you can do for the next 6 months. I appreciate the money you've given Bob Torricelli and the Democratic Party and our efforts. I am grateful for that. But it is not enough, because the American people are trying to get a grip on this period of change. They're trying to understand what's going on, and you can help.","And it's exciting. You should feel privileged to live in this time. Believe me, there's a lot more good than bad in it. Believe me, if we do the right things, the children that are here in this audience will have the opportunity to live out their dreams more than any previous generation of Americans ever has. You should be happy and proud to have the responsibility of citizenship at this time.","And so I ask you as you leave tonight to think about it: What do you want America to look like for your children and grandchildren, and what are you willing to do to make it happen? And what do we have to do in Washington to help everybody have their chance at the American dream in a country that's going forward together? That is what is at stake.","I think I know what road the American people will walk into the future if they understand what the choices are. You must help your fellow Americans understand the choices.","Thank you, God bless you, and good night."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraiser11","text":["Hello, everybody! Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat, especially Tom McMillen and Dikembe Mutombo.  Every time I stand next to them I look like a little kid.","I want to thank three people who are just extraordinarily important to the project of rebuilding our country and have just been great friends of mine, great friends of the Democratic Party--you already heard from one--please give it up for Governor Tim Kaine; our DNC finance chair, Jane Stetson, who's racking up a lot of frequent flier miles; and Andy Tobias, our DNC treasurer--hey, Andy.","It is great to see all of you here tonight, wonderful to see so many good friends, many of you who were there from the beginning of this campaign. And I want you to all know that I appreciate everything that you've done, not just for the campaign, but also what you've done for the country and what you've done for the party.","Many of you were invested in this campaign at the very beginning when nobody could pronounce my name. And you'd tell your friends, \"There's this young guy, I really think he's got something.\" \"What's his name?\" \"Barack Obama?\" Yes. So you had to confront a lot of skepticism, a lot of confusion. Some of you were involved in a campaign for the first time, and some of you got involved for the very first time in a very long time, because you believed that we were in a defining moment in our history and that your voice could make a difference.","Not a single day goes by where I don't think about all the time and the energy, the money, the commitment, the unyielding faith that you put into our campaign, because it wasn't just about winning an election, it was about changing a country.","Last year, we asked you to take on something new. We asked you to help us keep the promises that we made in the campaign, help to bring about the changes that we had talked about together. And a lot of you have worked hard to do that. You've continued to be engaged in education policy, in foreign policy, and helping us at a grassroots level and continuing to finance our ability to get our message out. And it matters. It's made the successes of the last year possible.","Sometimes I think we got so many things done so quick that people forgot. But let's just think about this: We upheld the principle of equal pay for equal work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and restored science to its rightful place in America. We provided health care to 4 million children who now have it who didn't have it before. We passed the strongest veterans budget in decades. We protected families from getting ripped off by credit card companies and children from being targeted by big tobacco, and helped consumers deal with the twin plagues of mortgage fraud and predatory lending.","We appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. We passed a service bill named for Ted Kennedy that's giving young and old a chance to serve their country and their communities. We're working with Congress to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.","Oh, by the way, and in the meantime, we prevented the worst financial crisis from getting even worse, turned the economy from contraction to expansion, made the largest investment in clean energy in history, the largest investment in education in decades, expanded the Pell grant program, dealt with a H1N1 virus on the side.","That's what your support has helped us do at home. Abroad, we've begun a new era of engagement. We're working with our partners to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, seeking a world free of them. We're working with other nations to confront climate change. We are now a leader and not a follower in that critical mission. We banned torture. We're rebuilding our military. We're reaffirming our alliances. We've begun to leave Iraq to its own people, as I committed to doing in the campaign. And we've charted a new way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We're making progress every single day in taking the fight to Al Qaida and across the globe. And I went to Cairo on behalf of the American people to begin a new dialogue with the Muslim world.","We're living up to our obligations as a wealthy nation, helping to promote food security around the world, helping to deal with diseases around the world. We're living up to a moment that demands American leadership by standing with the people of Haiti as we speak.","So in ways large and small, we've begun to deliver on the change that we talked about, the change that you believed in and that you campaigned hard for. But the reason that you and I are here tonight is because we're not done. We've got a lot more work to do.","As I said, the day we took office, we confronted a financial system on the verge of collapse; we were losing 700,000 jobs per month; a $1.3 trillion deficit; two wars that frankly had not been paid for and were costly in every sense of the word. A lot of the solutions we proposed, the decisions we took, they weren't quick, they weren't easy, and they weren't popular. But we decided we were going to go govern, we were going to put politicking on hold to get this country out of the mess it was in.","I mentioned this to a group I spoke to earlier. You know, pundits act surprised about the fact that we spent so much political capital. Well, you know, I didn't get elected to play it safe. And I didn't govern, and I don't govern, by checking the polls every few days. I know that's the habit in Washington, but that's not the obligation I owe the American people, that's not the promise I made to you. And because we took bold and swift and coordinated action, we can stand here today and say we averted another depression. We broke the back of the recession. The economy is growing again.","So the worst of the storm has passed. But, as all of you know, the devastation remains. We've got 10 percent unemployment. Many of you watching at home, as you go around the country and your individual communities, you see the stores shuttered and the foreclosed businesses; friends and neighbors, family members who still can't find work. This is on top of a decade that had been tough for middle class families all across the country. They hadn't seen their incomes go up in years. Their costs skyrocketing at the same time as their wages were stagnant.","For 2 years, I heard stories all across the country, everywhere I go. I heard stories about people trying their best to hold on; a family sitting around the kitchen table wondering if they were going to be able to retire on schedule, if they were going to be able to finance a college education for their kids, wondering when would health care costs stop climbing, when would their premiums start stabilizing. And people started expressing doubts about whether the dream that generations built and defended, the American Dream, was slipping away.","That's the reason I ran for [SPEAKER]. That's the reason you supported me. And that's why we are going to continue to do everything we can to create an economy that hasn't just recovered back to the status quo, but an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is rewarded, and where businesses are hiring and wages are rising, and where our middle class is getting stronger and more secure.","Now, our most urgent task is job creation. That was our number-one priority last year and our number-one priority this year. And the first task was to make sure the economy is growing. It is growing. But we've got to do more. So we're going to give tax breaks and loans to small businesses to help them hire new workers and raise their wages and invest in new plants and equipment. We're going to put even more Americans to work on clean energy facilities and upgrading our infrastructure to meet the challenges of the 21st century.","We're going to create incentives for consumers to make their homes more energy efficient, creating jobs and saving families money. And we're going to look at our Tax Code, because it's time we ended practices like giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas instead of investing in companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.","But the truth is, these steps alone won't make up for 7 million jobs that have been lost over the last 2 years. They're not going to, alone, provide the economic security that's been dwindling for middle class families over the last decade. The only way we do that is to lay a strong foundation for growth over the long term. And the things that we talked about during the campaign are the things that still need to be done. They've been put off by Washington for too long.","And this is where change gets hard. Change is easy if you're just talking about tinkering around the edges. Change is harder when you actually dig in and try to deal with the structural problems that have impeded our progress for too long. This is where we run headlong into the lobbyists and the special interests and the bitterness and misinformation that characterizes so much of our politics, which means that some of you may be feeling discouraged, because it feels like things have taken longer than you might have expected.","Well, don't be discouraged. I'm not discouraged. I knew this was going to take a long time, but I knew the fight was worth it. And we've got to keep up on this fight. The forces of the status quo, they may not give an inch, but I don't give an inch either. And you shouldn't give an inch either. We're not--[applause]. We didn't come this far to put things off, or to play it safe, or to take the easy road. That wasn't why we were elected. We came here to solve problems for the next generation, not for the next election.","That means opening up this Government to the people. That's why we post all our visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs and seats on boards and commissions. That's why I've called on Congress to put their earmarks online so everybody can see what's going on. That's part of the change that we promised.","We've got to change the tone of Government and politics here in Washington and all across America. I'm not going to give up on that either. You know, the American people are right to be frustrated about a Washington where every day is election day and the basic theory is, \"If you lose, I win,\" where we're not measuring success by what we're doing for the American people, but how we look in the latest Gallup. No wonder people are frustrated.","That's why I went to the House Republican caucus the other day. We had a good discussion-- --about the challenges that are facing the American people, our ideas to solve them. That was good for the country. It's good for our democracy. I had fun.","Now, there are some issues that Democrats and Republicans aren't going to agree on, and that's okay. Vigorous debate is healthy. We're going to tussle from time to time. And you know what? There may be some issues that we do agree on, or at least we say we agree on. And we have to test whether or not people are serious. So I told my Republican friends I want to work together with them where I can, and I meant it, because I don't want to just score political points. I've got time to campaign down the road. In the meantime, there's a lot of work that we've got to get done together. And we can get a lot done together.","And I told them I will also call them out if they say they want to work on something and then when I offer a hand I get nothing in return. The American people have to understand that. The old playbook of just blocking everything, I understand that's easier than actually doing something, and sometimes it may be more politically effective, but that's not what's going to move our country forward.","That's why I'm here. That's why you joined our campaign. That's what you've helped deliver over the last year. That's why I need your help now. That's why Tim and everybody in the party needs your help now, because you know as well as anyone that change doesn't come without a fight. We've got some fights to wage.","We've got some fights to make sure that we're sparking innovation and igniting a clean energy sector where American workers are making solar panels and wind turbines and cutting-edge batteries for the new plug-in hybrid that leads on clean energy, because the economy that leads on clean energy, I believe, is going to lead the global economy. And I want America to be that nation.","We're going to keep fighting to make sure that America has the best education possible for every child. And we're going to reward success through our Race to the Top program. We want every child to meet their potential, and that's why we're going to make sure that young people all across America can afford college without going broke. That's a priority. We can do that. And we could do it this year.","We're going to keep fighting for commonsense rules of the road for Wall Street. And I want to be clear--there's a lot of talk about Wall Street, Main Street--we need a financial sector that works. That's a priority. We need businesses that are thriving, and they've got to raise capital; that will help them hire workers. So there's no separation between our financial system and the real economy. That's part of what this crisis has reminded us. But we've got to ensure that our economy isn't brought to its knees by outdated and antiquated financial rules and the irresponsibility of a few.","And that's why I expect Democrats and Republicans to want to make sure that we don't find ourselves in this same situation again. That's why we have to have financial regulatory reform. And yes, that is why we're going to fix the health care system, a health care system that too often works for insurance companies better than it does for individual Americans.","And again, I didn't take this on because it was easy. I got David Axelrod; he does all the polls. He whispers in my ear, \"Man, this health care thing is hard.\" I am a amateur historian, so I know that seven [SPEAKER]s, starting with Teddy Roosevelt, couldn't get this done. We understood this was going to be hard.","But I took it on not for its political value; I took it on because families are dealing with skyrocketing premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and insurance companies that routinely deny coverage because of preexisting conditions, or drop people altogether when they get sick. We took it on because the costs were killing small businesses and creating an uneven playing field for our international companies, and it was eating into workers' take-home pay and canceling raises. And we took it on because it's the single best way--in fact, the only way--that we are actually going to get control of our Federal budget.","So when I hear \"deficit hawks\"--quote, unquote--out there who say they want to control the Federal budget and aren't willing to do a darn thing about the skyrocketing costs of health care, I get a sense they're not entirely on the level. Because our proposal for health care reform, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would bring it down by $1 trillion over the next two decades. And even in Washington that's a lot of money.","I took it on because every single day, 15,000 Americans join the tens of millions who don't have health insurance, and 18 million--18,000 Americans die because of the lack of health insurance.","That's what we campaigned on. That's what we're working to get it done, with Democrats and with Independents and with Republicans. We want to bring down costs and end the worst insurance practices and finally give every American a chance to have the security of quality, affordable health care.","I am not going to walk away from those fights, and I don't expect you will either. You've come this far. I mean, the odds were a lot less that I'd ever be standing here than they are that we can solve some of these big problems. I mean, think about it. Tim was--when Tim endorsed me in Richmond, first endorsement I got outside of Illinois of any elected official--here he is, newly minted Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia--there was one thing that was clear, and that is he was term limited.","But don't you guys--you remember this. Nobody gave us a chance. This campaign was declared dead--what?--10 times. You know, the same folks who are now writing about \"what next,\" and \"what's happened to the Obama,\" these are the same folks who were writing about how he doesn't stand a chance; how after New Hampshire, that was it; after Pennsylvania, that was it, right? We went through this. And they were saying your faith was misplaced and that you've set your sights too high and your hope is naive and Washington won't change. And now all of them are feeling like, \"See, we told you, Washington doesn't change.\" And they're feeling kind of self-satisfied about the fact that we haven't yet gotten health care done.","Well, let me tell you something. You didn't listen to those voices then. Your voice proved them wrong. You proved that nothing can stop the power of millions of people who want to see an America that's living up to its values and its ideals. That's what you did. And that's what I'm asking you to do again.","This is an extraordinary moment. I want to remind you, we don't quit. And I don't quit. And we are going to bring about the changes that you believe in and I believe in, and that, ultimately, will help our children and grandchildren believe as they grow up an America in which everybody's got a decent shot at life, in which we're leading in innovation, in which we're proud of our foreign policy.","That's what we were fighting for then. That's what we're fighting for now. We've taken some good steps. We got many miles to go on this journey. I hope you join me.","Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteefundraiser7","text":["Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you, everybody.","Well, it is good to see all of you here tonight. What an incredible honor to be introduced by Ernie Green. Please give Ernie Green a big round of applause. I would not be standing here today were it not for people like Ernie Green.","And how about my new DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She is tireless--tireless. And she's got the most adorable kids, and I don't know how she keeps up with everything. But as Michelle said, \"If you want something done, put a woman in charge.\" So-- --all right, everybody got--women, you got a little too excited on that.","You know, I've been thinking a lot lately about this campaign gearing back up, and obviously, it evokes memories of 2008. And I think back to that night in Grant Park when all the work, all the traveling through Iowa, all the stops by diners and in folks' living rooms and in barns in some cases-- --had all culminated in this incredible moment, a moment that was less about me than it was about the American people and the commitment that we made to each other, that we wanted a country that was true to its founding ideals, but had adapted to a new century, an America that was big in spirit and bold in vision.","And I said on that night that this wasn't the end, but rather, it was the beginning. Because what we understood even then was that our country had reached a crossroads. That we had a series of decisions that were going to help determine the future not just of our children, but our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. That we were living in an age in which the world had shrunk; it had become more interconnected than ever before. And that if we did not make some critical decisions now, if we stopped just kicking the can down the road, but we decided that we were actually going to seize the moment and transform our education system and finally fix our health care system and deal with our energy policy so that we were no longer subject to the whims of the spot oil market, and if we didn't transform our foreign policy to recognize the visions and dreams of billions of people around the world who were yearning to be free--if we didn't make some fundamental changes, that we might be the first generation that was passing on an America that was less hopeful, that was less generous, and that all those people who felt the American Dream slipping out of their fingers, that somehow that loss of hope would continue.","And I said at the time, this is going to be an uphill climb. Now, I didn't know how uphill it was going to be. None of us did. It turned out that on that night we had already lost millions of jobs because of the financial meltdown and the recession. And it wasn't until a few months after my Inauguration that we realized we would ultimately lose 8 million jobs before any of our economic plans had a chance to take effect, the worst recession since the Great Depression. And there are families all across the country that are still suffering from the aftershocks of that.","And so we had to immediately start acting. And in some cases, the actions we took weren't always popular. But we knew that it was vital for us to act boldly and swiftly to address the crisis.","And let's take a look at what we were able to accomplish. An economy that was shrinking by about 6 percent has now grown for five consecutive quarters. An economy that was shedding jobs every month now has seen over 2 million jobs created just in the last 14. An auto industry that some had written off now are making profits again and have hired back all their workers. The financial system stabilized. We got the economy moving in the right direction.","And along the way, we did a few other things. Along the way, we did a few other things. We decided that we didn't want equal pay for equal work to be just an empty slogan, so we strengthened laws to make sure that our daughters are treated as well as our sons.","We decided that in a nation as wealthy as ours, it was unacceptable for people to go bankrupt just because they got sick. And so after 100 years, we finally delivered on the promise of making sure that we had affordable, accessible health care in this country for all people.","We made record investments in clean energy, record investments in basic research, and restored science to its rightful place.","We made the largest Federal investment in education in our history, but we didn't just put more money in. We decided we were finally going to deliver on reform and help catalyze reforms in 40 States all across the country to make sure that schools are doing right by every single student, K through 12. And we also made sure that young people are able to afford to go to college, so we took away billions of dollars of subsidies that were going to banks and put those in the student loan system so that millions more young people were able to go to college without taking on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of debt.","We appointed a couple more women on the Supreme Court, including the first Latina. We ended the law that said that you could not serve your country because of who you loved. We made the biggest infrastructure investment in this country since Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System.","Internationally, we brought 100,000 troops back from Iraq and are ending combat operations. We regained momentum in Afghanistan and are now in the process of transition, where we can bring our troops home. We have gone after Al Qaida relentlessly and made America safer in the process.","And we've restored around the world a sense of America as a responsible actor that will uphold the principles of human rights and liberty and democracy.","And in between, we've dealt with pirates and-- --do you remember? Remember pirates-- --H1N1 and an oil spill and locusts? So we've been pretty busy.","And I couldn't be prouder of our record over the last 2 years. Promises were made during the campaign, and so many promises have been kept.","And yet, all across America, folks are still struggling. We've been able to avert the worst possible crises, but a lot of those challenges that we confronted in 2008, those challenges are still out there. Wages and incomes have flatlined for the middle class all across America. The rates of poverty in too many communities are way too high. In too many schools, too many of our children still drop out without hope, without vision for the future.","We still don't have an energy policy in this country that is equal to our potential and our greatness. And we're still vulnerable to high gas prices that are just killing families all across America right now.","We still haven't reformed our broken immigration system. So we have too many people living in the shadows, being exploited by workers, driving down the wages of workers as a consequence, because those employers aren't subject to the rules. And families are being broken up in the process.","We still haven't fully transformed our economy so that we're competitive the way we need to be and are creating jobs at the pace we need and growth at the rate that we need.","And so we still got so much work to do. The challenges we confronted were not the work of 1 year or 2 years or even one term. And that's why I'm going to need you. That's why, in some ways, this campaign may be even more important and more challenging than 2012. We have to finish what we started. We have to finish what we started, in 2012 and beyond, and that's why I'm going to need you, all in.","Part of what made our campaign special was you, going out knocking on doors and organizing, some of you traveling to other States in the middle of winter, occasionally getting doors slammed in your faces. \"Obama who?\" But that energy, that inspiration that you gave me, the commitments you made to each other about the kind of country you wanted to live in, that spirit we need now more than ever.","And that's part of the reason why we decided not to have our campaign here in Washington, DC, but to have it based again in Chicago. Because I don't want a campaign that suddenly is all about the insiders, suddenly is all about the pundits and the lobbyists. And I wanted to make sure that we had a campaign that was rooted and grounded in what folks are talking about around the kitchen table and around the water coolers all across America. And that's why it's going to be so important that you are as engaged, as involved, as motivated, as you were 2 1/2, 3 years ago. Because what's at stake right now is not any particular policy; it has to do with a broader vision of where we want to take our country.","We--I gave a budget address a while back, and a lot of people reported on the numbers and the debt and the deficit and why this is so important. And let me tell you, we as Democrats, we as progressives, need to be just as concerned about the debt as anybody else. Because that's how we will be able to move our vision forward--investing in education, investing in infrastructure, investing in clean energy--if we've got a government that lives within its means. So we've got to be concerned about that.","But this broader budget debate that is now carrying over and will probably continue all the way until November of next year, it's also about what our vision of the country is. Are we a country that's going to continue to be able to do big things? Are we going to continue to make a commitment that every child, regardless of race or station or region, can achieve their dreams because they've got a school system that's delivering for them? Are we going to continue to be a nation that has the best infrastructure, moving products and services and people and information from place to place, because we've invested not just in roads and bridges and ports and airports, but in broadband lines and smart grids? Are we investing in the future the way previous generations invested in us?","Are we going to continue to make sure that here in the United States of America we're discovering the new great sources of energy that will help us save the planet, even as we're strengthening our economy and are putting our people back to work? Are we still dreaming big dreams in America? And are we going to continue to be a country that makes sure that our senior citizens can retire with dignity and respect and that Medicare is going to be there for them and Social Security is going to be there for them?","And as we grapple through these problems, are we going to make sure that the burden is shared by everybody? We're going to have to make tough choices. But are we going to make sure that folks like me, who have been so blessed by this country, that we're doing our part?","The other side right now, their only agenda is to provide tax cuts to folks like me. And you know what, we all like tax cuts, but-- --no, I mean, I've never met somebody who said, \"No, no, no.\" But you know what, I don't want $200,000 in my pocket if I know that that means that 33 seniors are going to have to pay an extra $6,000 for their Medicare services. That's not something I want. I don't want special favors for me if it means that a whole bunch of kids are being cut out of Head Start.","See--and the reason I don't want it is not just out of a sense of charity. It's because my life is better when, as I'm driving down the street and I pass by a school, I know, you know what, that school is doing a great job for those kids. And if I pass by a senior couple holding hands and I think to myself, you know what, that might be me and Michelle some day. And I like the fact that I live in a country where they've got some security in their golden years.","I--that makes my life better. That's the kind of America that I want Malia and Sasha to inherit. That's the kind of America I want all of your children and grandchildren inheriting. That's what this debate is about. That's what this campaign is about. That's what this election is about.","So let me just close by saying this. There have been times over the last 2 1/2 years where I know you all have gotten frustrated sometimes. I know all these conversations you're having. \"Oh, why did Obama compromise with the Republicans on that?\" \"Why did health care take so long?\" \"Where's my public option?\" You know?","And I know that even though everybody is saying nice things, people are saying-- --I know people are also saying, you know, he's looking old. You know, he seemed so fresh and young back in 2008. Now, look, he's all gray and-- .","You know, we've gone through some setbacks. In some cases, we haven't gotten everything we wanted done as quickly as we wanted it done. You know, I'm a little dinged up here and there.","But I tell you what, though. The vision that brought us together in 2008, that's undiminished in me. The confidence I have in the American people, in their decency, that's undiminished. My faith that we can make tough choices on behalf of future generations, that's undiminished. My belief in you has not lessened.","So when you think back to these last 2 1/2 years, I want you to do so not with complacency, not with full satisfaction, but I want it to motivate you. Don't let people tell you that we can't bring about change. We have already brought about change. And we have more work to do.","And if you are with me, if you're all in, if you're willing to knock on doors and call your friends and call your neighbors and keep at it, even when the journey is tough, I have no doubt that we will get to where we set out to go 3 1/2 years ago, and we will deliver the kind of America that we want to our children.","God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdemocraticnationalcommitteeluncheondenver","text":["Thank you very much. Governor, I'm very grateful for what you said and grateful for what you're doing. It's hard enough to be a Governor; even if you've been doing it as long as Roy hasit still requires some effort. And to do that and still be willing to travel around the country and represent the Democratic Party and deal with the challenges we've had to face in this last year takes somebody with a heart of gold, and a steel backside to be on the plane all the time, and a pretty tough skin to take some of the slings and arrows that they fling at you. And I don't think we could have had a better leader for our party than Roy Romer in this last year. And I'm very grateful to you.","Thank you, Mrs. Webb, for being here and for what you said. Wilma and I had a good talk at lunch about the kind of the afterglow of the experience we had in bringing the G- 8 conference here a few months ago. When I saw Sharon, I told her that for the rest of my life every time I saw her I would imagine her riding into the arena on that beautiful horse. I was almost willing to take odds she would have ridden in here on that horse today. It was wonderful.","But it was a great experience for us. And it was a great thing for me to be able to show that part of America to the other world leaders and to the rather vast retinue that came with them from all over the world. And I can tell you, they were just fascinated because I was kind of carping at lunch I go a lot of places, but very often I might as well just be moving around from Federal office building to Federal office building in Washington. Sylvia Mathews is hiding her head. You know, my staff's idea of a good foreign trip is: I get off the airplane; I get in a limousine; I go to a government office building; I talk to three people over a cup of coffee; I go get briefed for an hour; I go to a dinner; I sleep a little bit and turn around and come home. And it doesn't really matter what country I'm in. I'm always ragging them about that.","But you were able to show all these people something really special about Colorado, about the West, and about the diversity and texture of America. And that's important because we have the same problems in dealing with each other around the world as sometimes we do in Washington. That is, the harder that you work and the less interpersonal time you have, the more likely you are to be driven by whatever the difference of the moment is being exaggerated by people who either work for you or work for them or write about it in the political press, and you wind up drifting apart. And so and sometimes unnecessarily. So the fact that I mean, you really did further the interest of the United States in building a more cooperative, peaceful world simply by letting them see real people living real lives in an interesting and, for them, a novel context. So I thank you for that.","Roy said one other thing that I want to reiterate. I want you to know that I thank you for being here, and you have to understand that there is a significant connection between your presence here and what happens in Washington and what has happened in Washington for the last 5 years. I don't think anyone would dispute the proposition that this country is in better shape than it was in 1992. And in 1992 when I ran for [SPEAKER], I wanted to take our country in a new direction based on our oldest values of work and family and opportunity and responsibility, community and world leadership, the things that America has stood for throughout this entire century, and most of it for most of our existence.","But it was obvious that we needed, among other things, a different notion of Government that the arguments that I read as a Governor and every Governor I knew, including yours, had the same reaction. We'd read in the paper every day, wherever we lived out here in the hinterland, about some fight they were having in Washington. And it looked to me like they were having a fight about whether the Government should try to do everything when we were broke and couldn't, or whether the Government should do nothing and just sit on the sidelines because Government was the source of all of our ills. Where we lived and worked and the people we worked with, we didn't think either one of those things was true.","So the first thing I did was, I went there with a determination to try to get decisionmakers in Washington to rethink the notion of Government and the role of Government in moving America forward and in bringing America together. And I believe that the role of Government is to give people the tools they need and establish the conditions so they can make the most of their own lives. And therefore, I think we should do those things which promote both opportunity and responsibility among citizens. We should do those things which bring us together, across the lines that divide us, into one America. And we should do the things that are necessary to maintain our leadership for peace and prosperity and freedom in the world, because all those things are necessary if we're going to have a 21st century which can be, and I believe will be, the best time in all of human history for the people of our country and hopefully for people around the world.","Now, there are differences between the parties. When I became [SPEAKER], my economic policy was unanimously opposed by the other party in Congress unanimously. Not a single one of them voted for my economic plan in 1993. And they said it would be the ruination of America; it would deepen the recession; it would explode the deficit. Well, 5 years later that plan has produced $810 billion worth of deficit reduction. The deficit is 92 percent smaller than it was when I took office 92 percent. That is before it's very important you understand it that is before the bipartisan balanced budget agreement kicks in. One reason we were able to have a bipartisan balanced budget and agree on how to do it is, it's not so hard once 90 percent of the heavy lifting is behind you. And I think it's important to emphasize that.","The second thing that we were able to do is to develop a national crime policy. And again, the leaders of the other party opposed my crime policy. I sometimes get tickled when I read in the paper, they talk about how the [SPEAKER] adopted Republican positions on crime. I said, \"Hello? Who are these people? Where were they?\" They fought bitterly bitterly.","Now, it's no secret; I've got a good personal relationship with Senator Dole and a fair and a high estimation of him. I awarded him the Medal of Freedom. I think he's a remarkable fellow. The angriest I ever heard him on the floor of the Senate was when he was unsuccessful in filibustering the crime bill. He tried to kill it.","The NRA was against it, said I was going to take everybody's guns away. And they said, \"If you put 100,000 police on the streets it wouldn't make a lick of difference just as sort of a boondoggle.\" They attacked us for being for after-school programs for kids and preventive programs to keep kids out of trouble in the first place. But our crime bill was basically written out of the experience of police officers and prosecutors and community leaders who were in communities where they were already lowering the crime rate by doing what was in our bill.","So we passed the bill with 100,000 police officers and with tougher punishment where appropriate, but with prevention measures and with the assault weapons ban. And 5 years later, we've had 5 years of steeply dropping crime, and the murder rate has dropped 22 percent in the last 3 years in this country.","Now, you know here in Denver you've just been through it the crime rate is still too high, and there's still too much violence in this country. But we're going in the right direction. And that happened because of a political choice the American people made, and they knew how to make it in part because they heard the messages of the competing candidates. There is a direct connection between your presence here and that decision. And we had a huge fight about it.","In welfare, the same thing is true. I didn't mind letting the States set the level of assistance to people on welfare because they had been, in effect, doing that for 25 years anyway. Before I ever signed the welfare reform law, there was a difference of more than 4 to one more than 4 to one between what a family on welfare could get in the State where the benefits were the lowest and the State where the benefits were the highest 3 1/2 to one. I don't want to overexaggerate3 1/2 to one. I just redid the math in my head.","And I had no problem in requiring people who are on welfare who are able-bodied and able-minded to go to work. I thought that was important, because we were talking around our table half the welfare caseload was becoming people who were just permanently on welfare, almost, and sometimes intergenerationally. And that has nothing to do with compassion. You are not being compassionate when you leave people in a position of dependency when they don't have to be there.","On the other hand, it's important, it seemed to me, when you require people who can work to work, not to ask them to hurt their children in doing it. After all, the biggest problem working families have today, many working families, is balancing the demand of taking care of their kids and taking care of their job. And I hear people even with very comfortable income levels, when they're honest, say they feel conflicts between their obligations to their children and their obligations at work. And I think that it's not an exaggeration to say the most important job that any society has, ever, is raising good, strong, ethical children. That is society's most important job. So why should we expect people on welfare to sacrifice the most important job of society to do what is the most important job, arguably, in the short run to give them the self-respect and the independence they need to contribute to our common welfare?","So I vetoed two bills because they took away medical care and nutrition for kids and they didn't give enough money for child care and because I wanted more money to put people to work in high unemployment areas. Once we resolved those things, I signed that bill. And I think it's a good thing. And the results are clear: We had the biggest drop in welfare rolls in history, 3.8 million fewer people on welfare than the day I became [SPEAKER]. So we're moving in the right direction.","The environment: The air is cleaner, the water is purer, the food supply is safer, and there are fewer toxic waste dumps. And we proved you could grow the economy and improve the environment at the same time. Now we have to prove we can do that with greenhouse gas emissions to deal with the climate change issue. And it will be tougher, but it clearly can be done clearly. There's no question, if you just look at the evidence, that we can do it.","So what I want you to know is that every time you see something like that that's good, that's a product of a choice because we had a fight about all those issues. We had an honest debate, a partisan debate about these issues.","In this last year we passed a balanced budget agreement that had overwhelming bipartisan support, but there were elements that our side brought to it. We said, okay, we want to balance the budget, and we don't mind giving families the tax cut; we don't mind giving businesses the tax cut if we invest properly in giving all Americans access to college we want tax breaks for that; we want to spend some money to provide health insurance coverage to the children of working families who don't have it. We've got enough money for 5 million more kids to get health insurance in working families with low incomes. That's half the uninsured kids in the country. And we got the biggest new investment in education since 1965. That was because of choices that we made in Washington that the people who were there wouldn't have been able to make if you hadn't helped us get there. There's a direct connection between your presence here and the things that are in that budget.","And just this last week let me just close with this I had a week it was a killer of a week. And what you saw probably in the headlines was the work we were doing on Iraq, but let me tell you what else went on last week.","We signed a bill that we worked on for 2 years to overhaul the way the Food and Drug Administration regulates medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and the foodstuffs they regulate 2 years. It passed by voice vote everybody. But underneath that there were these incredible conflicts and rubbing up against and debates and everything. And the way it came out, I believe the public interest is dramatically advanced, because if you've got a safe drug or if you've got a safe medical device, for goodness sakes, you want it on the market as quick as possible. So we had to strike all those balances. Well, the public interest side of that a lot of that work over the last 2 years came from people that you helped to elect and from attitudes that you helped to advance.","I signed a bill dramatically overhauling the foster care and adoption procedures and clearing away a lot of the obstacles to quicker adoption, even for children that have serious health problems. And my wife has worked on these subjects for 25 years. I have rarely seen her as happy as she was last week.","And all these advocates from all over the country came in, and I met a family that had adopted 20 children, including 3 of them who were wheelchair-bound. And to see these people who care about these kids you know, just last year we put in a $5,000 tax credit for adoption. But you need to know we all talk about how we believe in family values there are hundreds of thousands of kids out there that need a home that are trapped in a foster care system.","And one of my staff members after it was over came up to me with tears in his eyes the guy has nothing to do with the human services area he came up to me, and he had tears in his eyes and said, \"I just want you to know that I spent 9 years of my childhood in one foster home after another. And this is going to change entire lives for people.\"","And then I went to Wichita, Kansas, to the Cessna plant and saw what that company is doing to take hardcore welfare recipients and put them through training programs and guarantee them jobs. And a lot of these women have been severely beaten by their spouses or partners, have no money, are high school dropouts. Cessna provides housing, a 3-month training program, a 3-month pre-job program, and a guaranteed job for anybody who can finish. And I saw people speaking they had two of these women speaking. If you'd been told that 6 months ago they were on welfare and had less than a high school education, you wouldn't have believed it. You would have thought they were members of the Wichita City Council. And I expect they both could be if they put themselves up for election now.","We announced you saw yesterday, we announced that we're going to have the first permanent peace talks between North and South Korea, in the four-party context we proposed, since the end of the Korean war. We're working through a very difficult situation in Iraq and, I think, in an appropriate way. And I know those things have dominated the news. But if you think about what happened in America for Americans this week, there were a couple of times when all of us just looked at each other and said, \"You know, this is what we got in public life to do. This is what makes all the other stuff worth it.\"","And what I want you to understand is, the decisions that are made and the way they're made are made by real human beings who have real views and real convictions, in conflict with other real human beings who also have honest views.","You know, I had a long talk with Senator Lott yesterday. I like Senator Lott. You know, we lived across the river from each other in our former lives, and it's nice having the Senate Majority Leader without an accent. We like each other. We understand each other. I had to give him 5 pounds of barbecue when Mississippi beat Arkansas in football. I like him. And he would tell you the same thing. We really look at the world differently. We see things differently. We have honest differences of opinion. And what Roy told you is true: That's what's kept this country going for 220 years.","I believe history will record that at this moment in time our views were right and that we prepared the world prepared America for a totally new world. But you've got to know that you helped to make it possible. And you should never let that sort of fashionable rhetoric demeaning the whole act of contributing to your democracy so people who believe what you do can hold up their side that's there's something wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that.","Tonight when you go home, you think about being at this lunch; you think about those adopted kids; you think about the people who are going to get drugs that will keep them alive; you think about those women that can now be going into the work force because their kids do have food and medicine and child care; you think about the doors of college being opened to everybody for the first time in the history of this country. You think about all that and be proud.","Thank you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdinnerforgovernormelcarnahan","text":["About Search"," ","Well, thank you very much. Let me begin by thanking Smith and Elizabeth for having us into this magnificent, beautiful place, for the Democrats again and specifically for Mel Carnahan; and for being such good friends and for being willing to be called Smith Barney and Bailey Smith and other names. I'm sure there's a reward for you in heaven for enduring those slings and arrows.","I want to thank the other Senators who have come here to express their support for you. I see Senator Boxer back there, Senator Murray, and Senator Cleland. I think Senator Harkin is here. There he is. And Senator Wellstone and Senator Daschle were here. I don't know if they're still here or not. But this is quite an outstanding turnout of your prospective colleagues.","I also want all of you to know that I have a different take on this than everybody this race than everybody here who is not from Missouri, because Mel and Jean Carnahan have been friends of mine for along time. Robin has worked with me, and their children I've had a chance to know. I want you to know that you did a good thing tonight, contributing to his campaign, because he was a great Governor and because he's a good man and a good friend and because he'll be a good Senator.","I'm for him in part because when only my mother thought I could be elected President in 1991 and my wife, as she never lets me forget Mel Carnahan was a Lieutenant Governor involved in a very difficult primary for Governor. He had all he could say grace over, and he still endorsed me for President in the Missouri primary. It was a brave and good thing to do, and I'll never forget it.","And I was the Governor of Arkansas. Missouri is my neighbor. I was raised idolizing Harry Truman. When I was a young man here in the Senate, I worked for Senator Fulbright and got to watch Stuart Symington up close. And I may be the only person here who's actually known Senator Ashcroft for more than 20 years, besides Mel. We served together as attorney general and as Governor, and we always had a very cordial, personal relationship.","But I can tell you that he actually believes all those things that the Republicans say. And I say that not to make you laugh but to say, you know, one of the things I don't like in a lot of these campaigns is, we get into all this name-calling and demonization. We act like, you know, what's really bad about our opponents is, they're doing these bad things, and they don't really believe them. That's not true about him.","We can laugh about this, but that's what they think about us. They think we're always playing to some crowd or another. And I think it's important to point out that most of us on both sides actually believe in what we're doing. And that's what makes the political system work. It's what gives the political system integrity. The main reason that I want to see campaign finance reform, since I'm not a candidate for anything anymore, and the main reason I really respect Smith because, you know, if we have campaign finance reform, it'll cost him a little less money, but then he'll have to open his home and have evenings where we actually debate the issues, instead of hustle you for money.","But the major reason we need to reform the campaign finance system, in my judgment, is that it's almost all the money goes to voter communication, and it's wrong to have unequal levels of voter communication. The people need to hear a full debate on both sides and have a full ability to evaluate the personalities of candidates on all sides in order to make good decisions. And the second main reason we need it is that the people in office and the people who want to get in office have to spend too much time raising money, and they're exhausted all the time, and they don't have enough time to read and think and talk to other people.","I would say the third reason you need it is the reason all the press says, which is, you know, the corrupting influence of big money. The truth is that over 90 percent of the time way over 90 percent of the time the people in both parties in the Senate and in the House vote their convictions. And way over 90 percent of the time the people that give you money never ask you for anything, except to keep in touch with them and discuss the issues and talk about things and listen to them if they've got something on their minds.","Anyway, to get back to the point I was making, I know both these men. And I don't have to demonize John Ashcroft. When we were young men together, we worked as attorney general together; we worked as Governor. I had a very cordial relationship with him. But he believes in how he's voted in the Senate, and I don't. And we should stop pretending that it doesn't make any difference who wins, or that it's all some game dominated by who gives money and all that. That's not true.","There are two great philosophical differences of opinion today, battling their way through Washington. They won in the elections of '94. We won when we beat the contract on America. The people ratified our decision in '96. We got together briefly in the welfare reform bill and in the Balanced Budget Act of '97. Then our approach was ratified in the '98 election. And then we won again when I vetoed their huge tax bill in '99, which would have undermined our ability to save Social Security and Medicare, balance the budget, pay off the debt, and keep investing in our future.","But we have now had we've got an ongoing debate here about what kind of country we're going to be, what our responsibilities to each other are, and where we're going. Now, I know this man very well, Carnahan. I know him very well. We worked together for years. I went to Missouri more than any other State when we were promoting welfare reform because he did the best job of any Governor in America in requiring people who were able-bodied to get training and to go into the workplace and getting big businesses to help him, but also caring about the welfare of poor people, to make sure that the children had health care and the people had a decent place to live and the child care was there and the transportation was there. He did it right. And if he's in the Senate, he will do it right. This is a very important thing.","I can also tell you that for Democrats, because we believe in activist Government, it's very important that we keep a certain number of innovative Governors coming into the U.S. Senate all the time, because they understand how this stuff works. And it's important that you have people from our part of the country elected to the Senate, so that we can defend it when we have to take tough votes on sensible gun safety measures, for example.","It's not a hard vote for people who have no significant rural voters, no significant percentage for getting the NRA mailings all the time. It'll be a hard vote for him. And he'll take it, and he'll do the right thing, but then he'll know how to defend it, which is very, very important.","So all these Senate races are very important this year. All these House races are important. But I want those of you who don't know Mel Carnahan to know you have an extraordinary opportunity here. I know this guy. He is a good man. He is a great friend. He was there with me when I was practically all alone and running fifth in the polls in New Hampshire. You want somebody that will stay hitched in the tough times and take a decision when it's not selfevidently the right thing to do.","He has been a fabulous Governor, and you heard him reel off the issues. I just want you to know this is a huge deal. These judicial votes today were just one example. Senator Ashcroft voted to kill the African-American State Supreme Court judge in Missouri, Ronnie White, and I believe did not fairly represent his position as a judge on criminal justice issues.","But there is an honest division here. You don't have to hate anybody to take the other one's part. But of all the races we've got going where we're trying to elect a new person to the Senate, this guy has a unique ability to make a contribution to the Senate, to the policies and the politics of the Senate, that no one else does.","You did a good thing in coming here. I hope you'll ask other people to give to his campaign. I think he's going to win, and all of us need to do whatever we can to help him.","Thank you very much."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksduringmeetingwithdepartmentdefenseleadership","text":["About Search"," ","Well, happy New Year, everybody. Let me begin by thanking Ash Carter, our Secretary of Defense; General Joe Dunford, Vice Chair Paul Selva, and all of our commanders here.","The purpose of this meeting, something I do on a regular basis, is to allow me to hear directly from those who are charged with the most solemn responsibility of maintaining the finest fighting force that the world has ever known and keeping the American people safe. It is in these meetings that we have been able to set broad strategy, identify areas where we have to improve, address the health of the force. And I can say to the American people that they are extraordinarily lucky and I am extraordinarily lucky to be served by such extraordinary patriots.","This will be my last meeting with them. And so part of my goal here is just to say thank you to them and let them know how much I appreciate the counsel, the advice, the leadership that they have consistently shown throughout my time in office.","But in addition to saying thank you, I will get their views on the fact that we still have a lot of active threats around the world and we still have men and women in harm's way around the world who are busy protecting our homeland and our vital interests and our allies. And we've got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there's continuity, and that any issues that still remain and obviously, we still have major fights against ISIS in Mosul and in Syria; Afghanistan is still active that in all of these areas we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next President will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me.","So it has been, as I've said repeatedly, one of the greatest honors and privileges of being President is serving as Commander in Chief to such outstanding people. And I couldn't have done it without all of you. And I know that my optimism about America going forward is in part because we have such an amazing military, not only one that knows how to fight, but also knows how to uphold the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the American military.","So I just want to say thank you to all of you. And with that, we've got to do some work. All right?","Thank you so much. I appreciate it."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksenergypottstownpennsylvania","text":["Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for the warm welcome. If I talk too long, it's going to be even warmer. I really appreciate the chance to come to the Limerick Generating Station. I'm glad to see it in action. More importantly, I was glad to see the people working here, glad to meet them, glad to get to know them. I appreciate their strong dedication to safety. I appreciate their dedication to the consumers you serve.","This plant serves 2 million homes in the area, and it does so in a way that does not require us to pollute the air. It's a perfect example of how we can grow our economy and protect our environment at the same time. And so thanks for receiving me. I'm honored to be here.","I thank John Rowe for introducing me, and thanks for coming over from Chicago. Appreciate you being here. I want to thank Chris Crane. I want to thank Ron DeGregorio. Thank you for having me, Ron. I want to thank the mayor, Sharon Valentine-Thomas, of the Borough of Pottstown. Thanks for coming, Madam Mayor. I appreciate you being here. I want to thank all the folks from the local government sorry about clogging the neighborhoods coming through, but thanks. Appreciate you letting me come by.","I want to talk about how the United States of America can continue to be the economic leader of the world. First of all, I think it's important that we're the economic leader of the world, because when you're the leader, it helps the folks who live in your country. See, it matters if we're on the cutting edge of change. It matters to people working every day in America if we're creating strong economic growth.","Today, we are creating strong economic growth. I mean, this economy of ours is moving forward with a full head of steam fifth year in a row of uninterrupted growth. Our economy grew faster than any other major industrialized nation in the world. We added 5.2 million new jobs since August of 2003. The national unemployment rate is 4.7 percent. Productivity is high, and that's important. A productive society will yield a higher standard of living for our people. Hourly compensation grew at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Our workers are taking bigger home bigger paychecks. The standard of living is on the rise. After-tax income is up. Things are good.","And the fundamental question is, can you keep them that way, see? And there's a lot of competition in the world that creates some uncertainty and anxiety amongst our people. And the temptation for some is to say, \"Well, we can't compete anymore so let's protect ourselves and let's withdraw; let's become isolationists.\" I think that would be a wrong approach by our country. See, we ought not to fear the future; we ought to shape the future. We ought to be confident in our ability to be able to compete and to remain the most innovative country in the world.","And so here are some ideas. First, if we want to be the economic leader in the world so our people can prosper, we need to keep taxes low. We need to be able to be a society that says, you get to earn more of that which you earn.","As you might recall, we went through a pretty tough time in this country over the past 5 years. We had a recession, corporate scandals, a stock market correction, a attack on our country. We went to war to defend ourselves; we've had high energy prices; and we had natural disasters. And yet this economy of ours is strong. And I believe the reason why is, is because of the tax cuts we passed in Washington, DC.","We believe that if you have more money in your pocket to save, spend, or invest, the economy grows. And so one way to make sure that we're the economic leader in the world is to make sure the tax cuts we passed are permanent. Now, people say, \"Well, if you make the tax cuts permanent, you can't balance the budget.\" Well, let me talk a little bit about how Washington works. I've been there long enough to be able to give you an accurate report.","Don't believe it when they say they're going to raise your taxes to balance the budget. They're going to raise your taxes and figure out new ways to spend the money. The best way to balance the budget is to keep progrowth economic policies in place. And, by the way, last year, because our economy was growing, we generated $100 billion more for the Treasury than we thought. And this year, because of the economy growing strong, we're generating better rates than we did last year.","And so the best way to balance the budget is to keep growing the economy so we collect more tax revenues and be wise about spending your money. See, in Washington, everything sounds good there; every program sounds fantastic. But Government, in order to be wise about spending your money, has got to learn to set priorities. And my priority is this: So long as we have a soldier in harm's way, he or she will have what it takes to achieve victory and secure America.","We're on our way to cutting the deficit in half by 2009. Congress is now debating a supplemental bill. It's money to help fund our troops in Iraq, as well as helping the victims in Katrina. And I've made it very clear that I intend to participate with them in keeping the spending down. And if they exceed the $92.2 billion request, plus monies for avian flu, I'm going to veto the bill. See, that's one way you keep fiscal discipline in Washington, DC.","We'll be competitive if we keep taxes low and be wise about how we spend your money. We'll be competitive, by the way, if we're smart about improving education for our people. See, this is a global economy, whether people like it or not. And the jobs of the 21st century will be either here in America or wherever the workforce is trained to fill those jobs. And therefore, it's important for us to make sure we educate our children early and emphasize math and science so our kids have got the skills necessary to fill those jobs.","We changed how we view public education in Washington. We passed the No Child Left Behind Act, see. It basically said, we're going to make sure we fulfill our commitment to Title I students, but we're starting to ask some questions questions that I'm sure are asked at this plant: Are you meeting objectives, for example? If you set a goal, are you meeting those goals? And so we set some goals: How about every child learning to read at grade level by the third grade? That didn't seem like an unrealistic goal to me. As a matter of fact, it was a necessary goal.","And then we said to the States, you measure. We're going to get you some money, but you measure to show us whether or not we're meeting the goal. And if you're not meeting the goal, figure out why. See, you can't solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem. And so the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, we're going to diagnose problems early and solve them, before it's too late. This business about shuffling kids through the school through our schools, based upon age, didn't work. It wasn't fair. It wasn't right. And so the No Child Left Behind Act says, we're going to measure early, and we're going to help children who have fallen behind in reading early, and then we're going to extend that to math.","See, one of the interesting things is because we measure, we know that we're doing fine in math in the eighth grade. But children get to high school relative to other countries, we're not doing fine in math. And we better do something about it now if we want to be the economic leader of the world.","So we've got a plan to, one, make sure the same standards applied to reading for early grades are applied to math. If we measure in the eighth grade or ninth grade and you're falling behind, you're going to get extra help.","Secondly, advanced placement programs work. I bet I'm looking at some folks out here who took AP when they were in high school. AP means high standards. But we don't have enough teachers around the country to teach AP, so we've got a plan to train 70,000 Advanced Placement teachers to keep raising those standards.","We want to have 30,000 adjunct professors in our classrooms in high school and junior sometimes it's not cool to be involved with science and yet it is cool. And we need people who are on the frontlines of science explaining that. I went to a school in Maryland the other day, and there was a NASA scientist there, explaining to junior high kids why the sciences matter and why it's fun to be in science.","We're going to make sure our Pell grants which, by the way, have expanded by a million kids since I've been the [INTERVIEWED] continue to have incentives in there for children to take rigorous academics coming out of high school and the first 2 years of college, and then if they maintain a 3.0 average or are taking math, science, or critical language, there's an additional $4,000 on top of their Pell grant. In other words, this is an effort to make sure that we have a workforce that can compete in a global economy so we remain the economic leader of the world.","I want to talk about energy, see. If we don't get it right in energy, we can have the most educated workforce in the world, but we're not going to be able to compete. We can have the lowest taxes in the world, the least regulations, the fewest lawsuits, but if we haven't done something about our energy situation, we're not going to be able to compete in the world.","And so that's why I've come to this important powerplant, to talk about how the United States can have a diversified energy policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of oil and more dependent on renewable sources of energy.","Now, one of the things I want to start off by telling the telling you all, and I hope others are listening, is that over the past 30 years, our economy has grown three times faster than our energy consumption. Isn't that interesting statistics? In other words, we're becoming more technologically advanced. And during that same period of time, we created more than 55 million jobs while cutting air pollution by 50 percent.","So what I believe the American people should understand is that we can put policies in place that encourage economic growth so you've got a better standard of living and, at the same time, become less dependent on energy from overseas and protect the environment.","So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing we got to do is understand that we've got to change our driving habits over time. You've seen the price of gasoline going up. One of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is because demand for oil is increasing in places like India and China, and the supply for oil is not meeting that demand. And the key ingredient for gasoline is crude oil. So when the Chinese economy is growing or the Indian economy is growing, and that demand is going up, so is your price at the pump.","One way to make sure the price at the pump doesn't go up as global demand increases for hydrocarbons is to figure out how to drive our cars with different kinds of fuels, such as ethanol. One of the really interesting developments that's taking place now in America is the use of corn-based ethanol pretty cool deal, isn't it, for the [INTERVIEWED] to be able to say, you know, we're growing a lot of corn and we're less dependent on foreign sources of oil. It's coming particularly in the Midwest right now, there's a lot of ethanol pumps and plants being developed there to manufacture ethanol from corn.","We've got to do more, though, if we're going to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, when it comes to ethanol. And so we're spending a lot of your money to develop technologies that will enable us to be able to manufacture ethanol from wood chips or switchgrass. Somebody said, \"What is switchgrass?\" I said, \"Well, it's grass that looks like a switch that grows in dry country.\" In other words, there's all kinds of opportunities to manufacture ethanol, and we're exploring ways to do so. America has always been on the leading edge of technology and research and development, and here's an area where we've got to stay on the leading edge of change.","Another way to help reduce our use of gasoline is through hybrid vehicles. They're coming; they're coming on the market. As a matter of fact, the energy bill I signed actually will pay you give you a tax credit if you buy a hybrid. We're trying to stimulate demand through the Tax Code. It makes sense. But there's going to be an additional breakthrough or additional breakthroughs when it comes to hybrid vehicles, starting with the development of a battery that will enable you to drive your first 40 miles on electricity. And the Federal Government is very much involved in this research. We're spending your money, again, on research to help fund breakthroughs for battery technologies that will enable you to drive a plug-in hybrid battery.","And, oh, by the way, on ethanol, just one thing I forgot to tell you is that there are 5 million flex-fuel vehicles on the road today. Flex-fuel means you can either have gasoline or ethanol or a combination of the two. You've probably got one and you don't even know it. The technology the barrier to change is not the automobile; it is the ability to make the fuel in quantities economic quantities so we can get them to you at the pump.","And same with hybrid batteries; they're coming. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles with new batteries, they're coming your way. And one of the reasons why is because the Government has entered into research partnerships with the private sector to accelerate these technologies, all aimed at making us less dependent on oil.","A third way to help this country remain an economic leader when it comes to the cars you drive is hydrogen. We spend about a over a billion dollars of research to bring hydrogen to the marketplace. One fellow reminded me, wisely, it costs it takes quite a bit of power to make hydrogen. An interesting way to make hydrogen on an economic basis would be through nuclear power, see. But we're spending money and time and effort, all aimed at making sure that the automobiles of the future will require less crude oil. And we're close to some significant breakthroughs.","It's going to take time to move away from the hydrocarbon economy to the hydrogen economy, and in the meantime, it seems like it makes sense to me to do something about the refinery capacity of the United States. Like, if you're worried about the price of gasoline you don't like it when your price got over $3 and I don't blame you you might want to ask the question, how come the Government isn't working hard to expand refinery capacity so that there's more gasoline? If you have more gasoline on the market relative to demand, guess what it takes the pressure off price.","We haven't built a new refinery in the United States since the 1970s. The regulatory burden is a lot. You're kind of used to that here in this industry. And so we got to cut through all that business. If we're serious about helping our consumers and getting more gasoline to the market, we got to have regulatory relief. I suggested to Congress that we put new refineries on abandoned military facilities. It seemed to make sense to me. And so we need to be wise about these policies so that we can say to the American people, we're on our way out of the hydrocarbon era. But in the meantime, let's be thoughtful of the consumers here in the United States.","We're also going to need a lot of electricity in the future. Electricity demand is projected to increase by nearly 50 percent over the next 25 years. That's a lot. And we better be wise about how we implement a strategy to meet that demand; otherwise, we're not going to be the economic leader; otherwise, our people aren't going to be having the good jobs that we want them to have; otherwise, your children and my children, our grandchildren are not going to have the bright, hopeful America that we want for them.","Now, one of the things that people have got to understand is that we get our we generate our electricity from four sources: coal it's about 50 percent; nuclear power about 20 percent; natural gas 18 percent; and then other renewable sources like hydroelectric, solar, and wind power. And that's the mix; that's the energy mix.","Coal is by far the most abundant and affordable energy resource. We got about 240 years at current rates of consumption. It's a valuable asset for the United States. The problem is, coal isn't when you burn it, it isn't clean. It doesn't meet our standards. It's not it doesn't enable us to say, you can grow your economy and, at the same time, protect the environment like we want.","And so we're developing clean coal technology. We're spending over $2 billion in a 10-year period to be able to say to the American people that we're using the money wisely to determine whether or not we can have zero-emissions coal-fired powerplants. It's in our interests that we do that. It makes sense. About 2012, under the FutureGen Initiative, we think we will build the first powerplant to run on coal and remove virtually all pollutants.","Natural gas is an important commodity. By the way, we can explore for natural gas in environmentally friendly ways. And we ought to be exploring for natural gas in the ANWR, as well as off the gulf coast of the United States.","Here's another interesting way to help make sure there's enough natural gas for this economy to grow by the way, natural gas, as you know, is not just used for power. It's used for fertilizers, a variety of uses. You can liquefy natural gas; you can put it in a ship, and you can send it long distances and still have an economic product. And there are places in this world where there's a lot of natural gas a lot. And they're building liquefied production facilities. And they put them on these ships but we don't have any places to off-load it in the United States. We got some, but not enough.","If we're really interested in diversifying our energy sources and making sure the American people have got enough energy to watch this economy grow, we have got to have LNG sites to offload the gas from abroad. And so what we've done is, I signed a new bill, energy bill, that clarifies Federal authority to license new sites, that reduces the bureaucratic obstacles to opening up the terminals and streamlines the development. It's in your interest that we enable liquefied natural gas to come into our country so that we can help take the burden off some of the pricing pressures that we're inevitably going to feel with demand going up and not enough electricity supply.","Thirdly, about 6 percent of the continental U.S. is highly suitable for the construction of wind turbines. And this is a really interesting opportunity for the country they ought to put one big one in Washington, DC. They say the experts tell me that this area alone has the potential to supply up to 20 percent of our Nation's electricity. I think that's an interesting opportunity. I don't know if it's true or not, but it's certainly worth trying to find out, in order to make sure this country has got a bright future. And so we got $44 million for wind energy research. And the goal is to expand the use and lower the cost of wind turbine technology.","In other words, we're constantly researching and looking. I don't know if you know this or not, but the Federal Government does spend money on research in a variety of fronts, and it should. And I intend to double the basic the budget for basic research over the next 10 years. The iPod like, I like to ride my mountain bike and plug in the iPod. The technology for the iPod came as a result of Federal research. The Internet came about because of defense money research.","So we're spending money on research. The reason I keep repeating that is not only is it going to help us diversify our energy sources and make us competitive in the world, but it also helps make sure America is always on the leading edge of technological change.","Solar energy the dream in solar energy is to develop technology so that someday your house is like a little generating plant, and if you don't use the power, you feed it back into the grid. It's possible, but it's not going to be possible if we don't spend money on research and development. So we're spending $150 million to combine Government money with private research money in solar technologies to see if we can't help foster technologies that will be able to capture the sun, feed it into your house, generate enough electricity, and if you've got a little excess, feed it back into the grid. I think that's a pretty interesting idea, and it's certainly one worth exploring.","Finally, I want to talk about nuclear power a subject you all are very familiar with. It is a really important way to meet our goals, which is to have abundant, affordable, clean, and safe sources of energy. The important thing for the American people to understand is this concept: One, nuclear power is abundant and affordable. In other words, you have nuclear powerplants, you can say, we've got an abundant amount of electricity. And once you get the plant up and running, the operating costs of these plants are significantly lower than other forms of electricity plants, which means the energy is affordable.","As I mentioned, nuclear power it's the second leading source of electricity here. We have 100 nuclear powerplants that operate in 31 States. Now, we haven't built one in a long period of time.","People in our country are rightly concerned about greenhouse gases and the environment, and I can understand why; I am too. As a matter of fact, I try to tell people, let's quit the debate about whether greenhouse gases are caused by mankind or by natural causes; let's just focus on technologies that deal with the issue. Nuclear power will help us deal with the issue of greenhouse gases. Without nuclear energy, carbon dioxide emissions would have been 28 percent greater in the electricity industry in 2004. Without nuclear power, we would have had an additional 700 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, and that's nearly equal to the annual emissions from 136 million passenger cars. Nuclear power helps us protect the environment.","And nuclear power is safe. It is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design. It is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear powerplants are incredibly skilled people who know what they're doing.","For the sake of economic security and national security, the United States of America must aggressively move forward with the construction of nuclear power-plants. Other nations are. Interestingly enough, France has built 58 plants since the 1970s and now gets 78 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. I think that's an interesting statistic, isn't it? The United States hasn't ordered a plant since the 1970s, and yet France has not only ordered them, they built 58 plants. And 78 percent of their electricity comes from nuclear power. They don't have to worry about natural gas coming from somewhere else. They worry about it, but they don't have to worry about it to the extent that we do.","China has 9 nuclear plants in operation, and they got plan to build 40 more over the next two decades. They understand that in order to be an aggressive nation, an economic nation that is flourishing so their people can benefit, they better do something about their sources of electricity. They see it. India I just came from India they're going to build some nuclear powerplants.","To maintain our economic leadership, we got to do it again. And so here's the strategy. First, in the energy bill I signed in 2005, there are loan guarantees, production tax credits, Federal risk insurance for the builders of new plants. In other words, we said, this is an industry that hadn't got much going since the seventies. It's an overregulated industry. It's highly risky because of the regulations to try to build a plant. People don't know this, but you get yourself a design for a nuclear powerplant; you start spending money for plans and engineering plans and everything; you get building; and all of the sudden, somebody can shut you down. And that makes it awfully difficult to take risk, if a lawsuit can cause you to spend enormous sums of money and have no productive use of the money spent.","And so we got together with the Congress and said, \"Well, how what can we do to create incentives to show the industry that we're serious about moving forward?\" Well, one is loan guarantees, and that gives investors confidence that this Government is committed to the construction of nuclear powerplants. Secondly is production tax credits, and those credits will reward investments in the latest advanced nuclear power generation.","In other words, there's incentives loan guarantee is an incentive, tax credits are incentives, Federal risk insurance. What the Federal risk insurance says is offered for the first six new powerplant nuclear powerplants. And the insurance helps protect builders of the plants against lawsuits or bureaucratic obstacles and other delays beyond their control. We have got what's called the Nuclear Power 2010 Initiative, which is a $1.1 billion partnership between the Federal Government and the industry to facilitate new plant orders. In other words, I have said, we need more nuclear powerplants, and here's a strategy to get them going, see. Here's a way to say to the industry, we're serious about this.","This time last year, only two companies were seeking to build nuclear powerplants. Now 16 companies have expressed an interest in new construction, and they're considering as many as 25 new plants, trying to get these plants construction started by the end of this decade. I want it to be said that this generation of folks had the foresight necessary to diversify our or to continue to diversify electricity supply and recognize that nuclear power is safe, and we did something about it. We just didn't mark our time. We actually did something about it so a generation of Americans coming up will be able to have a better America.","I understand the issue of waste, and we've got to do something about it. We've got to be wise about nuclear waste. I'm a believer that Yucca Mountain is a scientifically sound place to send the waste, and I would hope that the United States Congress would recognize that as well.","I also recognize that we can do something on a reprocessing front. And so I got our administration to commit to the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. I think you'll find this interesting; at least I did. Under the partnership, America is going to work with nations that have already got an advanced civilian nuclear energy program, such as France and Japan and Russia, and we're going to use new technologies that effectively and safely recycle spent nuclear fuel. In other words, we're coming together to say, how can we do a better job of reprocessing and recycling fuel?","And the reason that's important, at least for our fellow citizens to understand, is it will reduce the amount of the toxicity of the fuel and reduce the amount we have to store. To me, it's a smart way to combine with others to reduce storage requirements for nuclear waste by up to 90 percent. It's a good way to work with other nations that are spending money on research and development as well. It's a way to, kind of, leverage up an investment. We're going to I've asked Congress to spend $250 million on this partnership. I hope they follow through with it. It is a necessary expenditure of money to make sure that the nuclear power industry can move forward with confidence, and the American people move forward with confidence as well.","And so here are some ideas not only ideas; this is what we're doing; this has gone from idea to action. What I'm telling you is, is that I understand the need to get off oil. I understand the need to work on renewable sources of energy. And I'm pleased to report we're working with Congress to do it. We're spending your money on research and development to find interesting technologies. You know, I hope that when my grandchildren and some of your children start taking their driver's test, they'll be cranking up a hydrogen-powered automobile, with hydrogen produced from electricity generated from plants such as these.","We have a duty to think about the problems this country is going to face. Listen, this economy is good, and I want to keep it that way; but I also want to make sure it's good 10 years from now. And I want to make sure that this global economy, this world that is becoming more connected, is one that doesn't cause us to fear and to neglect our duties, but that we put policies in place that enable us to remain confident, that we're an entrepreneurial society, that we're well-educated people, that we're willing to work hard to raise our families and put bread on the table. And we've got to make sure we have a good energy policy to do that.","I want to thank you for giving me the chance to come and share with you today what the country is doing right now. I want to thank you very much for showing what is possible. I appreciate your hard work here.","May God bless you all."]}

The way I look at it, you're almost old enough now to run for [SPEAKER]. But, as I say, Jack, don't let the uniform upset you, because, you know, we enlisted in the reserves at about the same time, and believe me, you should have seen my uniform I was in the horse cavalry, which brings up an important point. You know, ladies and gentlemen, I recently disclosed that the real reason I ran for [SPEAKER] was to bring back the horse cavalry. And when I took office some people told me I was now the most powerful man in the world. So, now that you're retiring, Jack, maybe you can tell me why every time I've brought up the horse cavalry in the Oval Office, you and Cap [Secretary of Defense Weinberger] would just smile and nod and say, \"Yes, Mr. [SPEAKER],\" and nothing would happen. ","Ladies and gentlemen, we're here today to honor and thank Jack Vessey for his years of service and devotion to America. As you've heard, Jack Vessey's military career has taken him right to the top: four-star general, Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, and ultimately Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all of this after receiving a battlefield commission. I know Jack was proud of every rank and command he held; in each he performed with skill, competence, and devotion to duty. And yet for Jack Vessey, I suspect the title of which he was proudest was the first one he every held during his 46 count them 46 years of military service, the one he earned the day he joined the Minnesota National Guard, the title that said, \"Jack Vessey, soldier.\"","General Vessey will be remembered for many things: as a battlefield hero you've heard today about North Africa, Monte Cassino, Anzio, and that grim night with the 2d Battalion in Vietnam; he'll be remembered as a man of patriotism and deep religious belief, an officer who brought character and credit to every billet he ever held; as a military leader who always spoke his mind to civilian authority, respectfully but candidly; as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who presided over the restoration of America's military strength and power at a moment critical to the fate of freedom and his country's security. In all these things, he bore the marks of greatness.","But there's one accomplishment that is not there in Jack Vessey's personnel file, yet it's an accomplishment that made the difference in the lives of so many GI's over so many years in so many places around the globe. Jack Vessey always remembered the soldiers in the ranks; he understood those soldiers are the backbone of any army. He noticed them, spoke to them, looked out for them. Jack Vessey never forgot what it was like to be an enlisted man, to be just a GI.","Mark J. Neal, of Las Cruces, New Mexico, remembers. In January of 1975, he was a private at Fort Carson, a member of the drill team there. He said recently that after one drill team event, he was in his residence doing dishes before the volunteer army, way back when Jack and I enlisted, it seems to me they had another name for doing dishes. Anyway, Mark Neal was told the commanding general wanted to see him. He was scared, of course, but he found his meeting and friendly chat with the general something he would always remember. After that, Mark Neal followed General Vessey's career. Hearing about his retirement, he wrote to him recently: \"This short meeting made a lasting impression on me. It was amazing to me that you even knew I was on the premises... even more amazing that you would want to meet me. That moment of thoughtfulness for a lonely enlisted man back at Fort Carson proved the truth of your reputation as a real soldier's general.\" There were many Mark Neals in Jack Vessey's career, and Jack Vessey made their lives a little easier, a little less lonely. And he made them a little prouder to wear their country's uniform and defend freedom.","Jack, in the 5 years or so that I've been doing events like this, I've learned something about people like you. A career like yours, combining as it does heroism, patriotism, competence, wisdom, and kindness, doesn't need elaboration from commanders in chief or [SPEAKER]; it speaks enough all by itself. And today I'll let history be your valedictorian, not me.","But what I can do today is thank you. On behalf of your friends here today who've had the honor of working with you and on behalf of some others who couldn't be here all your fellow Americans, if they had the chance to be here, they would express their gratitude to you for making their lives and the lives of their children safer and more secure. And then, there's that other group I'm standing in for today. I know all of them would want to be remembered to you. I'm talking, of course, about those young people who wore the uniform for Jack Vessey, had the privilege of having their own GI general. So, from all of us, Jack your friends, your fellow Americans, but especially the soldiers who stood a little taller because of you thanks, thanks from a great and grateful nation. May God bless you and give you and Avis many more rich, fruitful, and happy years together.","And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present to you a great soldier, a great general, a great GI Jack Vessey."]}

But he's doing a heck of a job. I'm so proud of my friend. It's become clear to all the hard-working FEMA employees that I didn't pick Joe Allbaugh because of his haircut. But I picked him because he's a good man who knows how to run a very important organization. And I'm proud of my friend. I'm proud of the job he's doing. And I'm proud of the work that the FEMA employees all across the country are doing on behalf of America.","I'm here to thank you all. I was up in the operations room, thanking the folks who are working 12 to 13, 14, 15 hours a day, still, to this day. I had the honor of going to New York City; I saw what they call \"dirty boot\" operations, from Sacramento and Puerto Rico all FEMA employees, all people who love their fellow Americans, all who want to join in to say loud and clear to the evildoers, \"Your actions won't stand in America.\"","Joe said it best. He said, \"This is something I hope I never have to go through again as long as I live.\" I know every FEMA employee feels that way. After all, yours was an organization that was used to dealing with, generally, acts of nature, hurricanes or tornadoes and fires or floods. And then all of a sudden, some evil people came and they declared war on America. And your agency and the good working people, true Americans, had to rise to the occasion.","And rise, you did. And for that, the people of New York and Connecticut and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and every other State in the Union are proud of the job you're doing. So on behalf of the American people, I say thanks from the bottom of our hearts for the FEMA employees.","I also want to talk about the battle we face, the campaign to protect freedom; the willingness of the American people to not only repair the damage done but the willingness of our Nation to stand united, to say loud and clear that freedom will stand, that you can tear down our buildings but you can't tear down our spirit, that we're strong and united in the cause of freedom not only here in America but all around the world.","This will be a different kind of campaign than Americans are used to. It's a campaign that must be fought on many fronts. And I'm proud to report that we're making progress on many fronts. Not only have the FEMA employees showed the world what it's like to stand up and help a neighbor in need; we're also beginning to make progress on the financial front.","As you may remember, I made it clear that part of winning the war against terror would be to cut off these evil people's money; it would be to trace their assets and freeze them, cut off their cash flows, hold people accountable who fund them, who allow the funds to go through their institutions, and not only do that at home but to convince others around the world to join us in doing so. Thus far, we've frozen $6 million in bank accounts linked to terrorist activity. We've frozen 30 Al Qaida accounts in the United States and 20 overseas. And we're just beginning.","Also, on the military front, we're making progress. We've deployed 29,000 military personnel and 2 carrier battle groups, as well as an amphibious-ready group and several hundred military aircraft. We've called about 17,000 members of the reserve to active duty, as well as several thousand National Guard operating under State authority.","As I said, this is a different kind of war. It's hard to fight a guerrilla war with conventional forces. But our military is ready. And as I said to the Congress, they will make us proud.","In this new kind of war, one that requires a coalition, we're making good progress on the diplomatic front. At our request, the United Nations unanimously enacted a binding resolution requiring all its members to deny financing support or safe harbor to terrorists. We've had 46 declarations of support from organizations including NATO, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Organization of American States.","You see, the evildoers like to hit, and then they try to hide. And slowly but surely, we're going to make sure they have no place to hide. Slowly but surely, we're going to move them out of their holes and what they think is safe havens and get them on the move.","We're a patient nation. We're a nation who has got a long-term view, a nation that's come to realize that in order to make freedom prevail, the evildoers will be forced to run and will eventually be brought to justice.","Now, along those lines, we're taking any threat seriously here at home. The FBI has conducted hundreds of interviews and searches, issued hundreds of subpoenas, and arrested or detained more than 400 people as it investigates the attacks. About 150 terrorists and their supporters, as well, have been arrested or detained in 25 different countries.","In my speech to the Congress, I said, sometimes the American people aren't going to see exactly what's taking place on their TV screens. But slowly but surely, the results are coming in. You see, we've said to people around the world, \"This could have happened to you. This could have easily have taken place on your soil. So you need to take threats seriously as well.\"","We're beginning to share intelligence amongst our nations. We're finding out members of the Al Qaida organization, who they are, where they think they can hide. And we're slowly but surely bringing them to justice. We're slowly but surely calling their hand and reining them in. We've just begun. There's 150 detained and more to come.","And along these lines, this weekend, through the collaborative efforts of intelligence and law enforcement, we've arrested a known terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of two U.S. citizens during a hijacking in 1986, a terrorist by the name of Zayd Hassan Safarini. He's not affiliated with Al Qaida, yet he's an example of the wider war on terrorism and what we intend to do. Here's a man who killed two of our own citizens when he hijacked a plane in Pakistan. By the way, obviously, there's only two Americans that's two too many but there was a lot of people from other countries, as well, involved. And he was convicted and sentenced to death, yet he only served 14 years. Well, we arrested him; we got him; we brought him into Alaska. And today the United States of America will charge him with murder.","Sometimes we'll have success in the near term; sometimes we have to be patient. Sometimes we'll be able to round somebody up who threatens us today; sometimes it may take us awhile to catch him. But the lesson of this case, and every case, is that this mighty Nation won't rest until we protect ourselves, our citizens, and freedom-loving people around the world.","The evildoers struck, and when they did, they aroused a mighty land, a land of compassionate people, a land who wants to help a neighbor in need, but a land who stands solidly on principles, the principles of freedom: freedom to worship, freedom to govern, freedom to speak, freedom to assemble.","We sent a loud message to the world: We will not be cowed by a few. We sent another message to the world: Together, we're going to bring these people to justice. And that's exactly what we're going to do.","Thank you for your hard work. I want to thank you all so very much for your hard work and for your love for America. May God bless you all. May God continue to bless America. Thank you very much. "]}

Thanks for coming out to say hello. It's great to be in southern Illinois. I appreciate the chance to come to Madison County. I'm honored to be the first sitting [SPEAKER] to visit the city of Collinsville. I'm sorry Laura is not with me.","[SPEAKER]. That is generally the reaction. I was hoping she and I could go look at the Catsup Bottle.","Thanks for waiting on me. I had a visit with some of the some folks from the area here, a neurosurgeon, a cardiologist, the administrator of a hospital, ob-gyn, a patient, all about the health care crisis that exists here in this part of the world. And that's what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about how we need to fix a broken medical liability system.","I want to thank all the good folks who provide health care for the folks in this part of the world, the nurses, the docs, the administrators. Thank you all for coming. Thanks for your compassion. Thanks for your care. Thanks for taking an active interest in an important issue that faces not only this part of the world but the country. But really what I'm here to do is to make say as clearly as I can, the United States Congress needs to pass real medical liability reform this year.","And there's no doubt in my mind we have a strong ally in this issue in the great Speaker of the House of Representatives from the great State of Illinois, Denny Hastert.","And I want to thank Congressman John Shimkus for his leadership not only on this issue but on other issues. It's good to be with his wife, Karen, again, sons, David, Joshua, and Daniel. Nice to see you boys. And you brought Mom and Dad. Your mom is probably telling you what to do, just like mine is. You're probably listening about half the time, just like I am. Welcome.","I'm also proud to be traveling today with a great Congressman from Peoria, Illinois, Ray LaHood. Thank you, sir. Appreciate you coming.","The State Treasurer of Illinois has joined us, Judy Baar Topinka. Appreciate you. Tom Cross is here. He's the minority leader in the house. I'll tell you what he's doing in the house of representatives for the State of Illinois: He is leading the medical liability reform effort. And I want to thank you, Tom, for taking a strong role. Appreciate you coming.","I know the mayor is here. Mr. Mayor yes, he's here, Stan Schaeffer. I appreciate you coming, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate you being here. I usually like to give mayors unsolicited advice: Fill the potholes. You've probably got some advice for me: Pass the highway bill.","I want to thank those of you who are working on this medical liability issue here in the State of Illinois. I appreciate your efforts. Look, it's about time the medical profession gets involved. It's about time you let people know what's on your mind. It's time to make sure that the issue comes to the forefront not only at the Federal level but at the local level as well.","I want to thank Connie Bergmann. I met Connie. She came out to the airport airbase, and kind of airbase-airport combo, I guess it is. She is a volunteer for the American Red Cross. The reason I bring her up is, every stop I make in America I like to herald a citizen who's taken time out of his or her life to volunteer to make the country a better place. See, the great strength of America is not our military might, and it's certainly not the size of our wallets. The great strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens, people who are willing to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved themselves, people who are willing to take time to volunteer to make America a better place. And Connie Bergmann is such a person. And I want to thank you for serving the Red Cross.","And speaking about the Red Cross, the International Red Cross is doing heroic work in a part of the world that has suffered incredible, incredible death and destruction. The American people express our sympathy to the victims of the tsunami disasters.","Yesterday I spoke to Secretary of State Colin Powell and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, who I sent on a delegation with a delegation to assess the relief operations. And they reported in that the devastation is beyond comprehension. They also reported in that they will come back with an assessment about how we can more effectively help. But they also reported that our military is doing heroic work in helping to save life. They're flying rescue missions 24 hours a day. They're making a huge difference in the people's lives over there by delivering supplies directly to those in need. Our Government has not only stepped up with the use of military assets, but we have pledged $350 million in disaster assistance to help the people over there who are suffering.","There's huge generosity here in America as well. As you know, I tapped a couple of ex-President's number 41 and number 42, to help out. I asked them to help, and they are. My dad and President Clinton have graciously given of their time to help make sure that people know there is a need and to make sure the donations are properly channeled into programs that work. If you want to help, get on the Internet for the USA www.usafreedomcorps.gov. There's a place to help. And on that web page, you'll find different agencies which are doing the good work.","What I don't want is, I don't want people to be sending money to places that aren't really doing the job. We don't need to support organizations that aren't effectively delivering compassion and help. And so on this web page, you'll find a way to help, if you so desire to do so. What they tell me is, the most important contribution a person can give is cash, and let the agencies on the ground be able to use that cash to best meet the needs of those who have suffered.","I want to thank all the Americans who thus far have been participating in this urgent cause. You're showing the true strength of America through your good heart.","I don't know if you know this: This is my first trip after the New Year. And it's good to come here to Illinois. I'm rested and ready to continue to serve to be your to continue to be your [SPEAKER] and to serve the people of this country. And we've got a big agenda item a big agenda and a series of items that we'll be dealing with.","First of all, we're going to win the war on terror. We've still got to we will be steadfast. We will be resolved. We'll be wise. We won't give in to these people. We have a duty in your Government to protect the American people. So the second big task at hand is to make sure we do everything we can to protect our homeland. And I will assure you I will continue to work to spread freedom and democracy and, therefore, peace in parts of the world that are desperate for freedom, democracy, and peace.","We're going to work with the Congress to be wise about how we spend your money. We're going to keep your taxes low so this economy continues to grow. We're going to continue to work with our farmers and ranchers to make sure they can sell the products overseas, in markets where people need food and beef and pork. We're going to work to pass a national energy plan. We're going to work to cut our deficit in half over the next 5 years.","And I look forward to working with members of both political parties to do something about our health care system. First, it is important for Americans to understand we have the best health care system in the world. And we need to keep it that way. We've got the best hospitals, both urban and rural. We've got the world's most talented and compassionate doctors and nurses. And we've got the world's and we lead the world in innovative research. We're on the cutting edge of change. We're saving lives through our research. Americans should be proud of our medical system, and we all must be grateful for those who work hard to provide compassion and care.","Our health care system faces serious challenges. We all know that. The cost of health care is rising rapidly, and that burdens our families. It hurts our small businesses. It makes it harder for the job creators to expand the job base. Too many Americans are left struggling to find affordable health care. And so I think we need to take practical steps to make sure this health care system of ours is more affordable and available, and we've got to take those steps this year.","To improve health care in America, we need to expand the use of health savings accounts. It's a product that lets you save tax-free for routine medical care while keeping affordable coverage against major illness. Small businesses must be allowed to join together, to pool risk so they can buy insurance for their employees at the same discounts that big businesses are able to do.","To address the cost of medical care, we need to apply 21st century information technology to the health care field. We need to have our medical records put on the IT. We need to make sure that we speed up the delivery and arrival of cheaper generic drugs to help control costs. We want to make sure our Medicare system still allows seniors to have choice in the system.","There's a lot we can do. We've got to make sure we expand community health centers around our country to provide care for the poor and the indigent. And we've got to make sure low-income children are enrolled in government health care programs so they receive the care they need. These are practical steps to help people be able to find health care at affordable prices and, at the same time, make sure the health care system is not run by the Federal Government but by patients and doctors.","To make sure our health care system works the way we want it to work, we've got to address the root causes of rising medical costs. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing information technology. Part of addressing those costs can be achieved by introducing generic drugs faster, just like I mentioned.","Some of the cost increases in our health care system are necessary and worthwhile. After all, research into new treatments requires major investments. World-class medical technology is expensive. In other words, to stay on the leading edge of medicine, it costs money. And I suspect somebody whose life has been saved by the latest technology is going to say that cost increase was necessary. But some costs are not necessary. And that's what the American people must understand and Members of the United States Senate and the United States House must understand.","Many of the costs that we're talking about don't start in an examining room or an operating room; they start in a courtroom. What's happening all across this country is that lawyers are filing baseless suits against hospitals and doctors. That's just a plain fact. And they're doing it for a simple reason: They know the medical liability system is tilted in their favor. Jury awards in medical liability cases have skyrocketed in recent years. That means every claim filed by a personal-injury lawyer brings the chance of a huge payoff or a profitable settlement out of court. That's what that means. Doctors and hospitals realize this. They know it's expensive to fight a lawsuit, even if it doesn't have any merit. And because the system is so unpredictable, there is a constant risk of being hit by a massive jury award. So doctors end up paying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle claims out of court, even when they know they have done nothing wrong.","That's what's happening in the system today. It's a system that's just not fair. It's costly for the doctors. It's costly for small businesses. It's costly for hospitals. It is really costly for patients.","When those providing insurance have to pay the bills for enormous jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements, they have to raise premiums on physicians they cover. Specialists in high-risk practices like ob-gyn or neurosurgery are particularly vulnerable to lawsuits, so their premiums rise the fastest. You're about to hear a couple of stories of folks in this area who can testify to that fact.","Because junk lawsuits are so unpredictable, they drive up insurance costs for all doctors, even for those who have never been sued, even for those who have never had a claim against them. When insurance premiums rise, doctors have no choice but to pass some of the costs on to their patients. That means you're paying for junk lawsuits every time you go to see your doctor. That's the effect of all the lawsuits. It affects your wallet. If you're a patient, it means you're paying a higher cost to go see your doctor.","If part of the national strategy has got to be to make sure health care is available and affordable, health care becomes less affordable because of junk lawsuits. And that's what the people of southern Illinois and the people of America must understand, that every time you read about big jury verdicts or out-of-court settlements or lawsuits being filed here or there, you're paying for it.","For some physicians, even raising costs for patients isn't enough to afford the premium increases caused by these lawsuits. And so physicians are faced with a terrible choice: give up medicine entirely, or to move to another place where they can afford to practice medicine. And that problem affects all doctors, from family practitioners in rural towns to surgeons in big-city hospitals.","In 2003, almost half of all American hospitals lost physicians or reduced services because of medical liability concerns. Think about that: One-half of all American hospitals lost physicians. Over the past 2 years, the liability crisis has forced out about 160 physicians in Madison and St. Clair counties alone. When doctors move or close their practices, guess who suffers: the patients, the people who live in these good towns in this part of the world. Pregnant women have to travel longer distances for checkups. Accident victims lose critical minutes in transit to faraway emergency rooms. New residents, people you're trying to get to come and live in your communities, have a hard time finding doctors willing to accept extra patients. And that causes the quality of life in your community to deteriorate. It's a problem that we must address.","America's health care professionals should be focused on fighting illnesses, not on fighting lawsuits. Junk lawsuits change the way docs do their job. Instead of trying to heal the patients, doctors try not to get sued. Makes sense, doesn't it? If you're worried about getting sued, you're going to do everything you can to make sure you don't get sued. That's why doctors practice what's called defensive medicine. That means they're writing prescriptions or ordering tests that really aren't necessary, just to reduce the potential of a future lawsuit.","They have specialists who stop taking emergency room calls. Doctors turn away patients with complicated, life-threatening conditions because they carry the highest risk for a lawsuit. Defensive medicine drives a wedge between the doctors and the patients, and defensive medicine is incredibly costly for our society. Altogether, defensive medicine drains some 60 to 100 billion dollars from the economy. Defensive medicine raises medical bills for patients and increases insurance costs for employers, and it takes money away that small businesses could use to invest and expand.","This liability system of ours is, what I'm telling you, is out of control. And you have people in this area and the doctors in this area understand what I'm talking about. A recent study ranked Madison County the number one place in the country for trial lawyers to sue. And that's a ranking I'm sure you'd like to get rid of. And those of you traveling in from St. Clair County aren't doing much better. St. Clair is ranked the second county in America where you're likely to get sued. In other words, if you see a team of trial lawyers spending a lot of time in the Collinsville area, you can be pretty sure they're not looking for horseradish.","Let me share some of the stories of the folks I met with today. I think this will help clarify what I'm trying to say to you. Dr. Chris Heffner is with us. He's a neurosurgeon from Belleville Memorial and St. Elizabeth Hospitals. Raise your hand, Doc. He is one of only two neurosurgeons still practicing south of Springfield, Illinois. You've got two people in the area. In just 2 years, his annual premiums have more than doubled from $131,000 a year to $265,000 a year. And at the same time, his amount of insurance coverage has been cut in half.","A few years ago, Chris decided that closing his head trauma part of his practice was the only way he could afford to stay in this area. He told me he loves living here in this part of the world. He likes to raise his family here. He and his wife made a tough decision to stay here, in spite of the fact that his premiums doubled and he got half the coverage. And so the only way he could stay here and to provide a level of care that he wants everybody to have was to cut out part of his practice. He still treats dozens of patients with spinal cord injuries, but now brain trauma victims in southern Illinois have to be airlifted across the river to St. Louis. He said, \"It's very distressing. I spent years of training to do brain surgery. It's a big part of my life. I made a commitment to stay here, but I had to make adjustments to keep the ax from falling.\" The system needs to be fixed.","Dr. Greg Gabliani is with us. He's from Alton, and he is a cardiologist. He was raised in Quincy, and he moved to Madison County in 2001, even though his colleagues warned him about the medical liability crisis here. In 3 years, his premiums have risen from $12,500 to $60,000 a year 3 quick years. Last year he had to stop performing certain procedures to bring his costs under control. He said, \"You either have to change the nature of your practice, or you have to leave.\" He didn't want to leave, so he's having to cut back on his services. We've got a problem, folks.","I met with Bob Moore. He's the CEO of Red Bud Regional Hospital. That's big Bob. He's a father of six, I want you to know. His hospital has a long tradition of delivering babies, but this past November, he made the difficult decision to close his ob unit. The malpractice see, he had the they employ the doctors in his hospital. They become the employer. They're going to cover the insurance for them, and it doubled from $150,000 to $270,000 more than doubled. They're paying $270,000 a year now. That's a lot for a little hospital in a small town. Maybe for a big hospital, it's not a lot, or for those of us who are used to dealing with the Federal budget, it's not a lot. It's a lot for a small town hospital.","Red Bud used to handle 120 deliveries a year. But now a lot of the women have to drive an hour to get to an ob unit. He said, \"You wouldn't get an ob-gyn to come here. It's affecting rural medicine.\" \"It\" happens to be the medical liability crisis, is affecting rural medicine. Lawsuits are affecting rural medicine. It's a societal issue that has to be dealt with. I couldn't put it any better, Bob. It is a societal issue that we must deal with. It is a quality of life issue. We don't want our little towns being not having any health care. We want people who live in rural America, like Crawford, Texas to be able to get to have a quality of life [applause].","Leslie Scariano is with us. She is an ob-gyn from Alton. She spent her entire career as a doctor in southern Illinois, and she has never been sued. She is a good doc. She shut down her practice on December the 31st of this year because her premiums have skyrocketed out of control. That means she couldn't afford to stay in practice. She had a choice to make: quit practicing medicine, or go broke. She said, \"I don't want to quit practicing medicine and I'm not going broke, so I'm going to move to Colorado.\" You lost a good soul from this part of the world because the system is out of control. Leslie's premiums will be about 80 percent lower in Colorado than here in Illinois.","I met with Kim Vogel, who is right with us yes, there she is. She was one of Leslie's patients. She's expecting her second child early next month like, soon. When she found out she was pregnant last year, Kim started seeing the ob-gyn that delivered her daughter, Katie. That ob-gyn moved to Tennessee. Then she started seeing Leslie. Leslie is moving to Colorado. Kim is now on her third ob-gyn, and she's worried about it. She said, \"I understand the doctors' position. I don't blame them. But as a patient, I see them leave and I think, what am I going to do now, and where does that leave me? I feel like I've lost control over how my pregnancy will go.\"","Unfortunately, this is not just a story confined to this part of the world. This is a story of pregnant moms all over America who are wondering whether or not they're going to be able to find good quality health care for their child and themselves. I've come to this part of the world because I want to assure you that, one, I understand the problem and I intend to work with Congress to do something about it.","You know, when I was the Governor of Texas, I felt that we could solve medical liability issues at the State level. And there was two things wrong with that strategy. One is that a State would pass good medical liability reform, and all the trial lawyers would do is go to the State that has lousy medical liability law. So you're not solving the problem, you're just shifting the problem. You're making the quality of life issue go from one area the deterioration of quality of life issue go from one area to the next. That didn't seem to make any sense.","But the other thing I discovered is that because of medical liability problems and lawsuits and increasing premiums and the defensive practice of medicine, your Federal budget spends $28 billion a year, extra money. See, we have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare and veterans' benefits. The rising cost of health care, the number of lawsuits, the defensive practice of medicine is driving up the cost to our taxpayers. Medical liability reform is a national issue, and it requires a national solution.","So I went to Congress with some proposals that I think are fair, proposals that will build confidence in the judicial system. Nobody likes to come to a part of the world that says the judicial system is out of control, and people lose confidence in it. We've got to have confidence in the fairness of our system. We want people who are harmed to be able to get have their day in court and get fair treatment in the courts of law. But we want we don't want a system that's so tilted the other way that it runs good doctors out of business and makes it hard for hospitals to deliver care.","I believe a victim of a legitimate medical error should be allowed to collect full economic damages, 100 percent of the cost of their medical care and recovery plus economic losses for the rest of their life. Seems to be fair, if you get hurt. And when appropriate, injured people should be allowed to collect reasonable noneconomic damages. And in the case of truly egregious wrongdoing, patients should be entitled to punitive damages. But there needs to be some reason when it comes to noneconomic damages in the system, and that's why I proposed a hard cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages.","Interestingly enough, the State of California has a cap on noneconomic damages that was enacted in 1975. Patients in that State see their claims settled a third faster than in States without those limits. In other words, patients are treated more fairly where there's a cap. And since 1975, insurance premiums for California doctors have become much more affordable premiums than anywhere else in the country than in most States. Caps on noneconomic damages work. It's a good idea, and the Congress ought to adopt them.","We have another problem with our legal system, and that is trial lawyers sometimes sue all the doctors involved in the patient's case even if most of the doctors have nothing to do with the patient's injuries. It's simply unfair to punish doctors who have done nothing wrong. And so to make sure doctors and hospitals are treated fairly, Congress needs to pass joint and several liability reform.","I think the people are beginning to understand the importance of this issue. I know you do. I know the people of this part of the world understand it, because you see firsthand what happens when the system gets out of control: 160 docs leave 2 counties. People understand that no patient has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit; no small business has ever grown because of a frivolous lawsuit; the cause of justice is never served by frivolous lawsuit.","I know you're serious about this liability issue here. I talked about it everywhere I went on the campaign nearly everywhere I went on the campaign trail, and I believe the voters made their position clear on election day about medical liability.","The House passed a good medical liability reform bill last year. I want to thank the two Members of Congress for working on it. The Senate failed to get the job done. Well, the new Congress is starting over, you know. We've got a new chance to get something done for the on behalf of the American people. Both Houses will have a fresh opportunity to address this issue. I'm looking forward to working with the leadership of the House to get the bill moving. It's important for the United States Senators from this State and other States to recognize the significance of the problem and get a meaningful, real medical liability bill to my desk so I can sign it in the year 2005.","Junk lawsuits affect more than just the medical field. According to a recent study, frivolous litigation has helped drive the total cost of our tort system to more than $230 billion a year. That's the equivalent of $3,200 for every family of four. The lawsuit burden falls especially hard on small businesses. And yet small businesses are the engine of job are the engines of job creation in our country. Seventy percent of all new jobs in America are created by small businesses. The tort costs in America are now far higher than in any other major industrialized nation. Think about that. We live in a competitive world. This is a global economy, and so our tort system has become a needless disadvantage for American manufacturers and entrepreneurs.","And so here are some actions Congress can take as well. To protect small businesses and workers, we need to change the way we handle class-action lawsuits. Interestingly enough, this is another problem you know well in Madison County. The number of class actions filed here increased by over 5,000 percent between 1998 and 2003, even though the vast majority of defendants named in those suits are not actually from Madison County. Think about that. These massive interstate class actions clog your local courts. They hurt the honest workers and communities of the businesses targeted by the class-action lawyers. The proper place for large interstate class actions to be tried is not in a local court but rather in a Federal court, which are designed [applause]. I look forward to working with both bodies and members of both parties to get good class-action reform out of the Congress this year.","I'll also work with Congress to reform asbestos litigation. Asbestos lawsuits in southern Illinois and elsewhere have led to the bankruptcy of dozens of companies and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Many asbestos claims are filed on behalf of people who are not sick. The volume of asbestos lawsuits is beyond the capacity of our courts to handle, and it is growing. More than 100,000 new asbestos claims were filed last year alone. Congress has begun considering options to improve the current system for handling asbestos lawsuits. They need to act and get the job done. I look forward to signing an asbestos reform in 2005.","I think we're sent to Washington to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Congresses. I believe we are called to do the hard work to make our communities and quality of life a better place. And it's hard work for some in Congress to stand up to the trial lawyers. I understand that. But all we're asking for is fairness. We want our doctors treated fairly. We want the hospitals treated fairly. And most of all, we want the patients and the American people treated fairly.","And I appreciate you all giving me a chance to come by and talk about the vital issue of legal reform. I intend to go back to Washington here shortly, and when I see Members of the Congress as I work this issue, I'm going to say, \"I spoke to the good folks of southern Illinois. They understand the problem, and they expect you, Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, to get the job done.\"","Thanks for coming by to say hello. I hope you and your families have a blessed and healthy 2005. May God bless you all."," "]}

Before I discuss the meeting that I've just had with Prime Minister Maliki, I just want to make a brief statement about Afghanistan.","I had the opportunity to speak with President Karzai this morning, and I wanted to congratulate him on accepting the certification of the recent election. As we all know, this has been a very difficult time in Afghanistan, to not only carry out a election under difficult circumstances, where there were a whole host of security issues that had to be resolved, but also postelection, a lot of uncertainty.","President Karzai, as well as the other candidates, I think have shown that they have the interest of the Afghan people at heart, that this is a reflection of a commitment to rule of law, and a insistence that the Afghan people's will should be done. And so I expressed the American people's appreciation for this step.","As I mentioned before, this has been a difficult election. You have violent forces opposed to democracy in Afghanistan. And yet despite these very difficult conditions, what we've seen is elections take place. We have now seen the IEC and the ECC in Afghanistan complete their work. We have seen the candidates expressing a willingness to abide by constitutional law, and there is a path forward in order to complete this election process.","I want to give particular thanks to Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and his team, who have been working tirelessly throughout this process. I also want to commend Senator John Kerry, who was in the region traveling and ended up working extensively with Ambassador Eikenberry and was extraordinarily constructive and very helpful. So I think he deserves great congratulations.","Moving forward, we will continue to work with our ISAF partners as well as the Afghan Government, however this election turns out, to ensure that we can move the Afghan that we can move Afghanistan towards peace and security and prosperity and that the will of the Afghan people is ultimately done. So we are pleased with the steps that have been taken today, and we hope that we can build on this progress.","I finally want to thank the incredible work of our U.S. military and the young men and women who are stationed in Afghanistan who are doing so much to help bring about a more secure and prosperous and democratic Afghanistan.","I am grateful to have the opportunity to see Prime Minister Maliki once again. We had a wide-ranging discussion about the continuing progress that Iraq is making. We have seen in the last several months a consolidation of a commitment to democratic politics inside of Iraq. We are very interested, both of us, in making sure that Iraq has an election law that is completed on time so that elections can take place on time in January. That is consistent with the transition that has been taking place, and I reemphasized my commitment to Prime Minister Maliki that we will have our combat troops out of Iraq by August of next year and all of our troops out of Iraq by 2011.","But we didn't just talk about military and security issues. What is wonderful about this trip is that it represents a transition in our bilateral relationship, so that we are moving now to issues beyond security and we are beginning to talk about economy, trade, commerce. The business and investment conference that's taking place is going to be very well attended. It includes not only Prime Minister Maliki but business leaders from both the United States and Iraq. We've seen over the last several months progress being made on providing clarification about investment laws inside of Iraq. There are, obviously, enormous opportunities for our countries to do business together.","And so I just want to congratulate Prime Minister Maliki on what I'm confident will be a successful conference and to reemphasize my administration's full support for all the steps that can be taken so that Iraq can not only be a secure place and a democratic country but also a place where people can do business, people can find work, families can make a living, and children are well educated. And that broader sense of a U.S. relationship with a democratic Iraq is one that I think all of us are confident we can now achieve.","So thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister, for your presence here today.","And I don't know if you maybe we could translate the last part just about Iraq, as opposed to Afghanistan, just in case there's some  ","Prime Minister Maliki. Thank you, [SPEAKER], and this opportunity to hold the business investment conference is a big economic demonstration and manifestation of the importance of this event that brings together more than 1,000 business entrepreneurs and a very distinguished, high-level Iraqi delegation.","I have also discussed with [SPEAKER]  the various issues and the fact that our relations today have moved along and not only confined to the security cooperation but today have moved to the economic development and to providing prosperity for the Iraqi people.","We have discussed the issues of common interest to our bilateral relations under the that are today framed under the strategic framework agreement and the various sectors, and all this is important for broader relation of our two nations.","We have also discussed the issue of the elections and the importance that these elections be held on time based on the national principles. We have also commented on the role of the United States that supports Iraq and the importance to end the international sanctions on Iraq and to remove Iraq from under chapter 7, because we don't have weapons of mass destructions anymore, and today, that we have put forth a lot of common sacrifices, and today, that there is a pluralistic political system in Iraq. This is important to move Iraq forward and to promote investments.","We will follow up on the outcome of the business investment conference in its various sectors because today, Iraq has moved beyond a dictatorship and beyond the destruction, and we are trying to rebuild all our sectors of agriculture, oil sectors, tourism, and so forth. We want to give the U.S. companies an opportunity to be present in investing in Iraq, and all this cooperation on the basis of the strategic framework agreement.","I thank you very much.","[SPEAKER] . Okay, thank you, everybody."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksfollowingroundtablediscussionthehomemortgageindustry","text":["All right. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to join us. We are here with a wonderful group of homeowners. And I think for so many people around this country, the essence of the American Dream is owning your own home, being able to have that piece of property that is yours, that allows you to raise your kids, that represents your single biggest investment. And obviously, one of the triggers of the financial crisis and now the economic crisis that we've suffered is that because in some areas housing got--housing values got way overheated, in some cases you had a lack of regulation that allowed all sorts of complex financial instruments take advantage of homeowners. We have seen a collapse in the housing market, a precipitous drop in values, and that led to a lot of the problems in the financial markets.","Here's the good news. At the beginning of this administration, we said we are--we were going to tackle directly the problems that homeowners were experiencing and figure out ways in which we could provide them assistance in reducing their interest rates, modifying their loans so that they would be in a position to stay in their homes and reduce their monthly payments. And around the table here you see some wonderful families who have taken advantage of what are now historically low mortgage rates, brought about in part by some extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve, but also brought about by the housing plan that Tim Geithner and Shaun Donovanhelped to design.","What you've seen now is rates are as low as they've been since 1971. Three-quarters of the American people get their mortgages through a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac qualified loan. And as a consequence of us being able to reduce the interest rates that are available, we have now seen some extraordinary jumps in the rate of mortgage refinancings.","And everybody here represents families who have saved hundreds of dollars a month, thousands of dollars a year in some cases, and that's money directly in their pocket. More importantly, what it's allowed them to do is to consolidate their loans in some cases, reduce the length of their mortgages in other cases. It has given them the kind of security and stability in their mortgage payments that a lot more people can take advantage of.","So the main message that we want to send today is, there are 7 to 9 million people across the country who right now could be taking advantage of lower mortgage rates. That is money in their pocket. And we estimate that the average family can get anywhere from $1,600 to $2,000 a year in savings by taking advantage of these various mortgage programs that have been put in place.","We've already seen a substantial jump, 88 percent increase in refinancings over the last month. We've seen Fannie Mae refinance $77 billion of mortgages in March, which is their highest volume in one month since 2003. And rates on 30-year mortgages have dropped to an alltime low of 4.78 percent.","So we are at a time where people can really take advantage of this. And what we want to do is to send a message that if you are having problems with your mortgage, and even if you're not and you just want to save some money, you can go to makinghomeaffordable.gov--makinghomeaffordable.gov. And the way the web site is designed, you can plug in your information and immediately find out whether or not you are potentially eligible for one of these mortgage refinancings.","Now, we are in the process of rolling out some additional phases to the program. Everybody here represent responsible homeowners who made their payments, who have jobs and income that support their mortgages. In some cases, people may have had difficulties because they lost a job, somebody in their family got sick, they may have missed some payments. And in those cases we also want to be helpful, and we are putting in place a loan modification program, working with banks, working with services, that will allow other folks who are closer to losing their home in a stronger position in the future.","So there are a range of different programs that are available for a range of different types of borrowers. The main message we want to send today is, is that the programs that have been put in place can help responsible folks who have been making their payments, who are not looking for a handout, but this allows them to make some changes that will leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes. So we hope that everybody takes advantage of it. Again, the web site is makinghomeaffordable.gov--is that right?--makinghomeaffordable.gov, so get on the web site, find out what's available.","Last point we want to make. As people have become aware that the Government is helping to promote refinancing, we're starting to see some scam artists out there who are contacting people saying, \"You can refinance your home. The Government has got a program; we're ready to help. Oh, but by the way, first you've got to pay some money.\" I just want everybody who is watching today to know that if somebody is asking you for money up front before they help you with your refinancing, it's probably a scam.","So take advantage of makinghomeaffordable.gov, and that will allow you to figure out exactly how to proceed on this in a way that's making you money, saving you money, as opposed to costing you money.","All right. Thank you, everybody."]}

We are so concerned in so many parts of the world with the problems that are coming today, next year, and the year after and it does take 5 or 10 or 15 years to educate a boy or girl and therefore there is a tendency to concentrate available resources on the problems we face now, and perhaps ignore what the potentialities and capabilities will be of our people 10 or 15 years from now.","Thomas Jefferson once said that if you expect a people to be ignorant and free you expect what never was and never will be. And from the beginning of this country, in order to maintain a very difficult discipline which is self-government, we have placed a major emphasis on education.","My own feeling is, we have to do better-not only in quantity but also in quality, and I am hopeful that we can develop in this country a cult of excellence in regard to education and intellectual development, which will make this country more equipped to meet its problems. What is true of us I'm sure is true of you. In some of your countries your problems are entirely different, and that is, making it possible for, in the mass, to educate great numbers of your people who today do not have that advantage, and also making sure that at the higher level we can train and then usefully employ men and women to serve not only their own interests but that of their country.","I want you to know we are very proud to have you here. Our educational system has represented the devoted efforts of our citizenry, but I think we can always do better. And perhaps by your presence here, and your questions, and your concerns, you have been able to stimulate us to move more forward along what I consider to be the most vital function of society: educating our people-making it possible for them to realize their potentials, and by serving their own personalities and development, serving the national interest.","So we're glad to see you and we hope that when you go home you will be able to communicate to them not only things that you may have liked here, or disliked, but also the sense of a people desiring to improve themselves and their country. Thank you."," "]}

Actually, this is an annual event started by Harry Truman. And I'm glad to be a part of a tradition here at the White House, saying thanks to our teachers.","I admire teachers and like teachers so much, I married one. Laura is a great advocate for literacy and a strong supporter for America's teachers, and I'm really proud to have her by my side during these unbelievable times and this great experience of serving our country—other than being a fine introducer. ","The thing I like about teaching is, teaching is such an optimistic profession. I know when teachers look out at their classrooms, you see more than a child at play or at study. You're able to see a child with big dreams and big hopes. You see future doctors and scientists and entrepreneurs and inventors, and I hope you see even a teacher or two.","You dedicated your lives to the formation of young minds. You're giving our children the skills they need to succeed in life and equally important, the courage and the drive to realize those dreams. Our Nation is grateful for your hard work. We appreciate what you do, and we are honored you're here at the White House.","I want to thank our Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings. She's been a long-time friend. She believes strongly in the classroom teacher, and she believes in the potential of every child.","I'm pleased to recognize Senator Sam Brownback, for the State of Kansas. Welcome. I'm glad you're here—and his wife, Mary; thank you for coming. As well as Congressman Dennis Moore from Kansas and Stephene, thank you all for taking time to honor the teachers who are here.","I appreciate the National Teacher of the Year Finalists: Sam Bennett from Florida— say hello to the Governor—Ron Poplau of Kansas—no wonder you all are here—and Susan Barnard of Washington State. We're really glad you're here. Congratulations on setting such a fine example.","Everybody here has been introduced to Kim Oliver, but you haven't met her parents, Vincent and Veronica. Thank you all very much—brothers, cousins, and significant other. ","I want to thank all the Teachers of the Year from around our country who are here. I really—Laura and I really enjoyed having our picture with you. It's just a brief moment to say thanks. But nevertheless, it's thanks from the bottom of our hearts. And it really means a lot you're here.","I thank Dr. Tom Houlihan, who is the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers. That's one of the sponsoring organizations. Thank you for your service, Tom.","Margery Mayer, of the Scholastic Education—Scholastic Inc. I want to thank Margery for being here. That's also a sponsoring organization of this event.","Kathleen Murphy is the president of ING, is here with us, as well as Tom Waldron, who is the executive vice president. These are the sponsoring groups of this important occasion.","I also want to thank the chief state school officers who are with us. Good to see you all. Nice going. Hiring and promoting good teachers is a really important part of your job. I want you to know that we know that being a teacher is difficult work. It's a hard job. It's a job that requires compassion and determination and extraordinary patience. And as Laura hinted, or maybe didn't hint, I was probably one of those kind that tested your patience.","You're helping young people to learn the basics of reading and writing and adding and subtracting. You're serving as mentors and, probably most importantly, as role models. You help kindle young imaginations, and you inspire a love of learning. It's a pretty significant job description, when you think about it. And the teachers we honor here today are excelling at that job.","Your daily efforts help young Americans grow into successful adults. In other words, you're building the future for the country. We ask a lot of our teachers, and we owe you a lot in return. Education is my top domestic priority. And when I first came to office, I worked with members of both political parties—believe it or not, it's possible here in Washington to occasionally do that—to increase funding from the Federal level but also to pass the No Child Left Behind Act. The spirit of the No Child Left Behind Act basically says, society has a deep obligation to challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations, that we believe every child can learn, and therefore, we believe it makes sense to determine whether or not every child is learning. And if not, there ought to be extra help so that no child in our society is left behind.","We're beginning to see good results, thanks to our Nation's teachers. The 2005 Nation's Report Card showed America's fourth graders are posting the best scores in reading and math in the history of the test. African American and Hispanic fourth graders set records in reading and math last year. America's eighth graders earned the best math scores ever recorded. Eighth grade Hispanic and African American students achieved their highest math scores ever. We're making really important strides toward closing an achievement gap in America, and I want to thank our teachers for your hard work.","There's more work to be done, obviously. I've recently launched the American Competitiveness Initiative, which will help our students do better in math and science. We need to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead AP courses in math and science. I know we've got some AP teachers here, and I want to thank you for that.","We need to bring 30,000 math and science professionals into our classrooms to send a message to our children: It's okay to be a mathematician or a scientist—as a matter of fact, it's cool. We want to make sure that we help students who struggle with math get extra help to make sure that—to make sure they have a chance to be able to earn the high-wage jobs of the 21st century. If we ensure that America's children have the skills they need to succeed in life, we will make sure America succeeds in the world.","Improving the quality of education for young Americans requires good laws and good policies, but ultimately it depends on good teachers. And that is why we're here on the South Lawn, to honor really good teachers.","The Teacher of the Year, Kim Oliver, teaches kindergarten at Broad Acres Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland. Broad Acres is Montgomery County's highest poverty school, a place where 90 percent of the children qualify for federally-subsidized meals and about 75 percent have parents who do not speak English at home.","It's a school filled with the kind of students that inspired Kim Oliver to become a teacher. Kim decided to become a teacher at a young age. It's really interesting for teachers to hear what she said. She said, \"As a young child, I loved and admired my day care teacher, Mrs. Chandler. I wanted to be just like her. Mrs. Chandler made me feel special, as if I were the only child in her class.\"","Kim Oliver had many friends growing up who came from unstable and impoverished homes. She says, \"I watched so many of my friends live up to the low expectations that were set for them. To this day, I find myself wondering, what if my disadvantaged friends had 12 years worth of Mrs. Chandlers in their lives?\" Kim went on to say, \"I chose to become a teacher to motivate and inspire the neediest students, who many have written off, and let them know they can achieve and succeed in life regardless of what the statistics may show.\"","I love that attitude. I think you're beginning to get the drift of why she's the Teacher of the Year. When Kim Oliver arrived at Broad Acres in 2000, the school was threatened with forced restructuring by the State as a result of poor academic performance. Ms. Oliver took a leadership role at the school. That's what good teachers do; they take the lead. She became a teacher-leader and helped lead a collaborative effort to improve the curriculum, instruction, and assessment. She helped establish instructional planning sessions and formal procedures to examine student work and improve student performance.","She noticed that many parents at the school lacked the language skills to be able to read to their children and to be able to help with their school work. And so she and her colleagues purchased cassette players and recorded books on tape for the students to take home and share with their families, which made it a lot easier for parents who struggle with English to help their children.","Kim Oliver also organized a regular \"Books and Supper Night,\" where families could check out books from the library and read together before sharing a dinner, which fostered learning and family involvement in their children's education. She knows what good teachers know: If you can get the parents involved in the child's education, you have a much better chance of succeeding. She set high expectations. Good teachers set high expectations. She provided needed assistance. She involved families, and she helped turn that school around.","Within 2 years of her arrival, kindergarten students at Broad Acres were mastering early reading skills at higher rates than other schools in the district. After 3 years, Broad Acres students were meeting or exceeding all requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. There were dramatic increases in reading and math scores for the school's second graders.","The Superintendent of Schools in Montgomery County says this about the impact Kim Oliver has had: \"She has a rare gift for touching hearts and minds, inspiring in her students to aim high and believe in their potential.\" A Broad Acres parent says, \"She knows how to talk to the children so they will listen.\" And all her students know that she cares about them. She made them all feel like they were smart and could learn anything. One of her colleagues says, \"When you walk into Ms. Oliver's classroom, one cannot help but notice that this is a special place.\" She is dedicated to her school community and committed to excellence, and she has been an instrumental force in improving student achievement at her school.","Kim says the reason her students are achieving is simple: \"I have high expectations for each of them. I teach them that they can accomplish anything with hard work and persistence.\"","Kim Oliver understands that the key to helping children succeed is fighting the soft bigotry of low expectations. When a teacher believes that a child can learn, it's amazing what happens; a student believes that he or she can learn.","America is blessed to have teachers like Kim Oliver. We're blessed to have teachers like all those who are gathered here at the White House. We thank you for the love and devotion you've shown our children each day.","May God continue to bless your work, and may God continue to bless our country. Thank you for coming."," "]}

On this spectacular day, I want to welcome everybody to the White House. Thank you all for being here.","I'm just going to come out and say it: This hurts a little bit. This is a hard thing for a Bears fan to do. It doesn't hurt as much as the NFC Championship Game hurt but it still hurts, you guys coming to my house to rub it in. What are you going to do, go to Ditka's house next or .","But in the interest of good sportsmanship, congratulations to the Green Bay Packers on your 4th Super Bowl championship and record 13th NFL championship.","Oh, you know, the problem you have, though, in your franchiseyour fans are not that enthusiastic. You guys have got to work on that. I'm surprised they're not wearing cheeseheads. Oh, there they are. All right, my mistake.","Look, obviously, it's good to have football right around the corner. Like every football fan, I was thrilled to have the lockout ended. Nobody likes long, frustrating negotiations with a rigid opposition, taking it to the brink.","I want to recognize Packers President Mark Murphy, GM Ted Thompson, for the outstanding job they've done, as well as Coach Mike McCarthy for guiding them to the next championship.","And I would like to welcome all the players to the White House; some of them I've had a chance to meet before, wonderful guys. I guess I especially have to welcome Charles Woodson. Where's Woodson?","[At this point, cornerback Charles Woodson approached the podium.]","[SPEAKER]. See, hold on a second. I wasn't asking for some certificate you're about to give me, aren't you? He's really rubbing it in. Look at that.","Now, look, I admit Woodson is a pretty good ballplayer. And for those who don't know, I gave Charles a little bulletin board material, apparently, last year. And so after the Packers beat the Bears, Charles addressed the teameverybody on ESPN saw it; I saw it while I was working out in the morningand Charles said, \"If [SPEAKER] doesn't want to come to watch us at the Super Bowl, then we're going to him.\"","Then I flew to Green Bay later that week to visit a local company, and Governor Walker and Mayor Schmittwhere's Mayor Schmitt? There he is right there. He gave me a jersey from Charles on which he'd written, \"See you at the White House.\" So basically, Charles has been giving me a hard time now for several months.","Charles, you're a man of your word. And I've now learned something that every NFL quarterback already knows too well: Don't mess with Charles Woodson.","Now, in the Super Bowl, the Packers showed just what a championship team is made of and that you deserved those rings Coach McCarthy had you fitted on the night before. The game was a lot like your season. Some key players went down with injuries in the first half, including Donald and Charles. But everybody stepped up. Your offense exploded behind one of the greatest performances by a quarterback in a Super Bowl. Where's Aaron?","Your defense was flying all over the place like Clay Matthews's hair. Where's Clay? There he is. And you brought the Lombardi Trophy back home.","Aaron earned the game's MVP award: 304 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions. This was a performance that capped off an incredible playoff run that proved he's not just one of the best quarterbacks in the game, he's one of the best quarterbacks perhaps of all time. And I know that he's going to be having an extraordinary career going forward.","We also know that the Packers are made of more than one player or one season. They're made of the people of Green Bay. Back in the twenties, fans passed the hat at the games to support the team. In 1923, after some rough financial years, local businessmen banded together to pay the bills. Two more timesin 1935 and 1950the community came to the rescue to keep the club afloat, and today, 112,000 people own a piece of this franchise. It is the only publicly owned team in pro sports, so[applause]. And after the Super Bowl, hundreds of those fans woke up the next day, put on their snow boots, and headed over to Lambeau Field to shovel it out for the victory pep rally.","That support goes both ways. The Packers have raised more than $4 million for charities in communities all across Wisconsin and Michigan. More than 300 schools participate in the Packers Fit Kids program to promote childhood health. They've given scholarships to local students, sponsored food and blood drives, found creative ways to support our troops and their families.","So even a Bears fan can admit that the relationship between Green Bay and its team is something special. It reflects those old-school, small-town values of community and hard work that have always defined what it meant to be an American. And Super Bowl spotlight or not, that's something that's alive in towns across this country every single day.","So to all the Green Bay Packers, to all the fans, congratulations. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because Bears fans have two dates circled on our calendars: September 25 and Sunday Night Football on Christmas Day. And if you guys are on a roll by then, just keep in mind that there's only one placeone person here who can ground all planes in and out of Green Bay if he has to.","So congratulations.","Charles, what do you got here? You can step up to the mike.","Mr. Woodson. Well, on behalf of the Green Bay Packers organization and all the players, we would like to present you with this. Of course, all the fans own the team, and it hurts us a little bit to give you this as well but to give you shares of the Green Bay Packers.","[[SPEAKER] was presented with a framed share of stock.]","[SPEAKER]. Man, that is outstanding. Thewell, if I'm a part owner, I think .","Coach Mike McCarthy. We figured this is the only way we could get you away from the Bears.","[SPEAKER]. No, what I'm thinking is, I think we should initiate a trade to send Rodgers down to the Bears.","Audience members. Boo!","[SPEAKER]. What do you think? No? How about","Mr. Woodson. A minority owner, thank you.","Coach McCarthy. Aaron, go ahead.","[SPEAKER]. All right, what else we got?","Quarterback Aaron Rodgers. On behalf of the team, we also want to give you the right colors to wear on those two dates you mentioned. We got you this jersey, right here.","[[SPEAKER] was presented with a team jersey bearing the words \"Commander in Chief.\"]","[SPEAKER]. All right, man. Thank you. Commander in Chief.","Mr. Rodgers. Why don't you change into that right now?","[SPEAKER]. Thank you. Good to see you, man. Absolutely.","All right. Let's get a good picture. They're going to break this down."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkshonoringthepointslightinstitute0","text":["It's a well-kept secret -- I didn't know this was about me. But thank you all very much, and thank you, Harris, for those very kind and extraordinarily generous remarks.","I particularly want to thank the President and the First Lady for opening up the White House, and for keeping the spirit of volunteerism alive and well. Service to others, he believes and I believe, we all believe -- and I have to be the most biased person in this room, but I think this President and this First Lady have done an extraordinary job in taking this concept forward.","I want to thank Ray Chambers and Marian Heard -- where's Marian? Right here. Quiet -- she is not -- normally not that way. And Ray. The amount they've done for this cause is just hard to quantify. It's just wonderful.","As much as 2009 also marks 20 years since we started a nationwide movement to mobilize citizens, and all backgrounds and all walks, to help their fellow man, let me thank those who were present at the creation -- from our fearless leader here at the White House in Gregg Petersmeyer, who was singled out a minute ago -- and our founding board members, of course, Ray and Marian Heard. And I see so many others here who have done so very much for this cause.","Once we were out of the gate, a number of talented people, including Bob -- is Bob here? Not here. There's the man, there he is -- joined the fight and helped keep the fire burning and our cause moving forward and touching more lives. And now, most importantly, we have two capable leaders stepping forward to head the Points of Light hands-on network, and they are, as you've heard -- a distinguished Georgian, Marian -- Michelle Nunn and Neil Bush, my son -- our son. And they have our full faith and confidence, and we are very fortunate they are doing the job and just pushing, putting in all the time in volunteer fashion.","Of course, Neil and Michelle and the entire Points of Light team can't do the important work by themselves. They need the support and inspiration of the corporate and civic leaders in this room. And there are countless more around the country, I might add. This is nationwide. And I think they're getting it. But let me thank each and every one of you for adding your leadership and your vision to this nationwide, vital cause.","In the final analysis, the same realities, the same truths that led us to set this shared movement in motion 20 years ago remain unchanged. And we still believe in the innate propensity of the American people to reach out beyond themselves to help others. That's what this is really all about. We still believe there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America. And we're here to affirm once more that from now on in America, there can be no definition of a successful life that does not include service to others.","I know the idea behind this event was to honor what our administration started, but speaking for my team, the honor was all ours. And that's the way it is when you engage in community service. The satisfaction of knowing that you've made a difference is indeed the greatest reward.","Of course, there's still so much to do. So let me simply close by encouraging our new leadership, all on the team, to get out there and keep fighting away. I may not be able to suit up again and get out on the field with you like I would want to, but the Lord knows I'll be there with you in spirit every step of the way.","And thank you all for being here. Thank you all for your support for this concept of volunteerism, helping others. It's a great thing.","And so now I have another honor, and that is to introduce a Point of Light, himself -- a musical Point of Light -- Larry Gatlin. Where is he?"]}

Good morning.","[SPEAKER]. Thanks for letting me come by to say hello. Shall we get started?","Teacher Nancy Tentman. Boys and girls, we have a very special guest this morning. We are honored this morning to have [SPEAKER]  here with us in our classroom, and he will be reading a story to us this morning. He's here on his visit to promote reading.","[SPEAKER]. I am here to promote reading. Thanks for letting me come by and read. First, I want to introduce the Secretary of Education, Dr. Rod Paige. He's a friend of mine. I knew Rod in Texas. He and I were from Texas. And I asked him to come up and become the Secretary of Education because he did such a fine job of being the superintendent of schools in Houston.","And we're all speaking about superintendents we've got the superintendent of the Washington, DC, schools with us, Dr. Paul Vance.","Superintendent Paul Vance. Good morning, boys and girls.","Students. Good morning.","[SPEAKER]. Thanks for having us here at Nalle. I'm so glad to see your principal, Ms. Dobbins. She's a pretty special person, isn't she?","One of the things that happens when you get over 50 and I'm over 50 is you have trouble seeing. [Laughter] So in order for me to read this book called \"More Than Anything Else,\" I had to put on my glasses.","This is also Black History Month. And what's important about Black History Month is to read about different heroes who have made a difference in making history and to realize there are fantastic role models. So this is a combination of history plus reading. So thanks for letting me come by.","One reason I like to highlight reading is, reading is the beginnings of the ability to be a good student. And if you can't read, it's going to be hard to realize dreams; it's going to be hard to go to college. So when your teachers say, \"read,\" you ought to listen to her.","Ms. Tentman. Thank you.","[SPEAKER]. Also, I hope you read more than you watch TV. That's pretty hard. Does anybody do that, read more than they watch TV? [Laughter] It's good to read more than you watch TV. That's how you learn, and it's very important to practice.","Are you ready to go?","Students. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. Has anybody read this book yet?","Students. No.","[SPEAKER]. And that's the end of the story. And the story is about a young fellow who grew up very poor and worked really hard. But he knew something. He knew, if he learned to read, he could change his life. I think it's a great story, don't you?","Students. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. It's a story that teaches the power of reading and what it means. So that's what's important, to be able to read, because you can read somebody else's experiences too, and you can share. And this is the story of an unbelievable young man who became a great reader and a great leader.","So thanks for having me come. Anybody got any questions?","Ms. Tentman. [SPEAKER], we have a tradition here in our classroom that whenever we read a book we have a reading chain here in our classroom. In each book we write the title and the author, and we'd be honored if you would join us in our reading chain by adding that book to our reading chain.","[SPEAKER]. I will do that. Thanks for letting me do that.","Good to see everybody.","Ms. Tentman. All right. Thank you so much, and we'll add that.","[SPEAKER]. I'm going to leave this here for you, too, as a gift.","Ms. Tentman. Okay. Thank you so much.","[SPEAKER]. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Ms. Tentman. And we will add this, boys and girls, to the end of our chain. And [SPEAKER] has signed it, \"More Than Anything Else.\"","[SPEAKER]. How about that? It's pretty nice, isn't it? Thanks for having me come.","One of the reasons I came is, I think it's important for the Capital to stay focused on public education and public education reforms. One of the key ingredients in our package we sent up to the Congress is a reading initiative. I'm so impressed about what Ms. Dobbins is doing at this school, what the superintendent is insisting upon accountability-based reading system.","And she told me that they've got a collaborative effort here with the National Institute of Health, which has developed curriculum based upon the science of reading. And it's impressive that the school and the District are willing to set high standards and ask the fundamental question, what works in education; are willing to implement curriculum that works; and then are willing to be held accountable for implementing the curriculum.","And thank you for letting me come. I appreciate you coming.","Q. [SPEAKER], would you be interested in establishing a panel along the vein of what President Johnson did, to look into racial profiling, or perhaps considering an Executive order banning racial profiling?","[SPEAKER]. I'll look at all opportunities, starting with the gathering of information, where the Federal Government can help jurisdictions, gather information, compile information to get the facts on the table to make sure that people are treated fairly in the justice system.","Q. [SPEAKER], do you have any of agreeing to the Pentagon's request that you increase your defense spending, your defense budget, or give a supplemental for 2000?","[SPEAKER]. I've sent the message that I think it's very important for us to not have an early supplemental. Secondly, Secretary Rumsfeld is beginning a review of the defense, a top to bottom review of what's happening in today's military, reviewing missions, reviewing opportunities for change, beginning to look at the transformation policy. And I will look forward to finding out what his report says.","I will be traveling the country next week, talking about some increases in the defense spending, along the lines of what I promised during the course of the campaign, starting with better pay for the men and women who wear the uniform.","Q. But they're saying it's going to affect military readiness.","[SPEAKER]. What's going to affect military","Q. They're saying that they need more money excuse me they're not going to be able to be prepared for","[SPEAKER]. Well, that's part of the review process. I hear there are a lot of voices on a lot of subjects regarding the budget. We have yet to submit our budget; I will, later on. But I have said during the campaign, I have said since I've been sworn in, it's important for us to do a topto-bottom review, to review all missions, spending priorities, and that's exactly what the Secretary of Defense is going to do. And before people jump to conclusions, I think it's important to get that review finished.","Q. What about the Justice Department? Are you asking for specific cuts in?","[SPEAKER]. We're looking at all we've asked our Secretaries on all Cabinets to take a review of their full budgets, and we'll submit a budget here later on.","Office of National AIDS Policy","Q. [SPEAKER], on the subject of the AIDS Office, there are still some misunderstanding about whether there is going to be an AIDS czar, like","[SPEAKER]. Well, there's going to be a focus on AIDS, and people can apply any title they want. But there's going to be a person in my office who has got the responsibility of coordinating the AIDS policy throughout the Federal Government.","Q. What did you say to Mr. Arafat?","[SPEAKER]. Oh, I had a good talk with Mr. Arafat. I've also had talks with other leaders throughout the region, and I urged calm. I said it was very important to give the newly elected leader of Israel a chance, a chance to form a government and a chance to do what he said he wanted to do, which is to promote the peace in the region. And I certainly hope that people recognize that change does not necessarily mean that the peace process won't go forward.","I think we ought to take Mr. Sharon for his word, and that is, he wants to promote peace in the Middle East. I look forward to watching him put a government together and then fulfilling what he said he would do.","Q. Are you concerned about the violence yesterday, the bombings?","[SPEAKER]. I'm concerned about all kinds of violence. But I firmly believe that the best policy is to encourage leaders to just remain resolute in their willingness to promote the peace and give the Sharon government a chance to form a government and then to be able to do what he said he wanted to do, which is to promote peace in the Middle East.","Have a good weekend, everybody."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksluncheonforrepresentativewilliamjjeffersonneworleans","text":["About Search"," ","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I've had a wonderful day here. I don't think I've ever had a bad day in New Orleans. [Laughter] And I'm honored to be here with Bill and Andrea, with Vic and Fran Bussie. And Vic, you've done a lot of great things in your life, but you haven't given many better talks. That was very, very good.","I'm honored to be here with your bright young mayor, who has established such a fine record and has recently joined the ranks of the happily married. [Laughter] We're proud of him for that, too.","Let me say to all of you—I was just sitting here listening to what everybody else was saying, wondering if I could offer any unique perspective. I first came to New Orleans 50 years ago. I hate that. [Laughter] I was just a little boy. My mother was in nursing school here. And one of the most vivid memories of my lifetime was seeing my mother kneel by the side of the railroad tracks and cry when I went home with my grandmother, because she had been widowed early, before my father—before I was born. My father died 3 months before I was born. And she came down here to get some education so she could support me.","I came back here when I was 15 and a budding musician. [Laughter] And they wouldn't let me in anyplace to hear anybody—[laughter]— because I was so young. And I saw—I never will forget this—I was walking away from my mother, and I saw Al Hirt sitting there in some big English limousine, reading a newspaper, and he was going to go in and perform. I knocked on his window, told him who I was, and said I had come all the way down here from Hot Springs, Arkansas, and all I cared about was music. I didn't want to drink anything; I didn't want to gamble; I didn't want anything; I just wanted to go hear him play. He took me in and put me on the front table. It's funny what you remember, isn't it?","I've never forgotten that, and that sort of embodies the generosity that the people of this city and this State have exhibited to me throughout my life. And you did give Al Gore and me, Hillary and Tipper, and our administration the electoral votes of the people of Louisiana twice, and I'm profoundly grateful for that.","I want to say three or four things I think you ought to think about in this election. When I became President, I ran a long, hard campaign. I was written off for dead three or four times along the way, and three or four dozen times since. [Laughter] But Bill Jefferson was one of my first supporters. I remember the first time I came here, when the Jeffersons had me in their home. I met their beautiful, brilliant daughters, and their family members, many of whom are here today. The Congressman's father is here, mother-in-law is here, many others here.","And we went through that campaign, and I found that, to a remarkable degree, we shared the same philosophy. We were proud members of the Democratic Party, but we didn't like the fact that our party had been a part of the leadership of 12 years of Republican Presidents when we had the majority in the Congress, and together they quadrupled the debt of the country; and that we were in a terrible recession. Interest rates were high. Unemployment was high. Wages had been stagnant for more than a decade. We didn't like the fact that people thought because we believed in the United States Constitution and we were against racial discrimination, that somehow we were soft on crime or we thought able-bodied people shouldn't work instead of being on welfare.","We thought that the Democratic Party, and African-Americans in general, had been twisted and distorted and used as political whipping boys in campaigns. And we thought Washington was divided by gridlock, and we wanted a change.","So I said, give me a chance to change America, to change the direction of the country, change our party, to change our leadership in Washington. I have a simple philosophy: I want America in the 21st century to be a place where every person, without regard to race, creed, gender, or anything else, has a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I want America to be a place where we're all coming together, not being driven apart. And I want America to be the world's strongest force for peace and freedom and justice and prosperity.","And my strategy for getting there is to do everything I know how to do to give opportunity for all, demand responsibility from all Americans, and create a community of all Americans. That's what we said we'd do.","Now, in 1992, it was an argument. And the people decided to give me a chance, even though I was, in the rather disparaging characterization of the incumbent President, just a Governor from a small southern State. [Laughter] The people decided to give me a chance. They bought our side of the argument.","By 1996, there was no argument anymore because the results were beginning to pour in. And now, in 1999, I can look back and say with gratitude and thanks and humility that it has worked out. The results speak for themselves. We have the longest peacetime expansion in history; 19.4 million jobs; the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years; the lowest welfare rate in 32 years; the lowest crime rate in 26 years. Today I announced that this year's surplus will be $115 billion, the first time in 42 years we've had a surplus 2 years in a row.","And I say that to make this point—and along the way, by the way, with the HOPE scholarship and other financial incentives, we've opened the doors of college to virtually every American. The air is cleaner; the water is cleaner; the food is safer; 90 percent of our kids are immunized against serious childhood diseases for the first time; 100,000 young Americans have served in AmeriCorps in their communities all over this country, including this one, and earned some money for college. And we've been a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. And I'm proud of that.","What's that got to do with this? Well, I'll just give you a few examples. And what's that got to do with the Governor's race, even if it has something to do with our record? And I'll give you a few examples of that.","Number one, all this started with one vote in August of 1993. The economy started getting better after the election, as soon as I announced my economic plan. But it did not get voted on in Congress until August, because it was fairly controversial. I had cut hundreds of programs but dramatically increased education. And I asked the wealthiest Americans to pay more taxes, and cut taxes on 15 million Americans who were working for modest wages, lower wages, with children in their home.","And there was a lot of controversy, and the Republican Party in Congress decided that they would vote against this to the person, that they would not give me one vote, and that they would tell everybody it was a just a tax increase, even though they knew only a tiny fraction of Americans were going to have one.","Now, that bill passed by one vote in the United States Senate, Al Gore's vote. And it passed by one vote in the United States House of Representatives. If Bill Jefferson hadn't voted for that, it wouldn't have happened, the recovery probably wouldn't have occurred, and none of us would probably be standing here today doing this. So I am grateful to Bill Jefferson.","I'm grateful to him for supporting our agenda to reach out to other countries—to Latin America, to Africa—to expand trade of American products, to build up the Port of New Orleans, to bring us closer to other people in other countries. I'm grateful to Bill Jefferson for supporting the anticrime agenda that Mayor Morial talks about all the time: Get guns out of the wrong hands; put more community police on the street; give our kids something good to do.","And I'm grateful to Bill Jefferson for supporting my education agenda every step of the way, including our plan to hire 100,000 more teachers to get class size down in the early grades, something he's running on; our plan to build or modernize 6,000 schools, which would include his commitment to air-condition the schools that don't have it; our plan to triple the number of our young people who are eligible for after-school programs; set high standards for failing schools, and if they don't turn around, let the parents go to another public school with their kid, but help the schools turn around.","We can do that. I've seen that all over America. I'm telling you, I've been in the schools in the worst neighborhoods you can imagine in terms of adversity, and I've seen children learning at a high level because of what was done in the school.","So, yes, I'm grateful to Bill Jefferson. And a lot of what we enjoy today came as a direct result of policies he supported that he played a critical role in bringing to bear.","The second point I'd like to make to you is that I believe I'm the only person in this room who has actually been a Governor. I know something about this. [Laughter] And I did it quite a long time. I served 12 years. I served for 12 years and would have served for 14 if the people hadn't elected me President. [Laughter] And I'm telling you, I loved every day of it. It is a wonderful job if you love people and if you care about good schools, good jobs, and creating strong, healthy, vibrant communities.","We have done more in the education area probably than any administration, certainly since the Johnson administration. But most of the money for schools and most of the direction for schools, by State constitutional law, comes from the State, in every State in America. So it is very important.","You know, education is very important to me, personally, and to Hillary and to all of our administration. But the President has to protect the American people in many ways; the national security has to come first, and then you have to deal with a whole range of other issues. But a Governor has no more important job, none, than education.","And a Governor also has to be able to get people together to really get things done. What you want in a Governor is somebody who is smart, committed, with a good heart, who is passionate about what he or she believes but is not particularly partisan. And I can tell you, Bill and I—we all came out of State Government; he and I both did. We're both, frankly, mortified by how partisan that crowd is in Washington. [Laughter] I mean, I always tell him there's plenty of things for us to argue about in the next election, but the people give us a paycheck every 2 weeks to show up for work in the meanwhile. And we're not supposed to fight about everything; we're supposed to work out things and get things done. That's the sort of person he is.","And he has a lot of friends in the Congress who are Republicans because they know that he has not responded in kind to the harsh partisanship of their leaders and that he is still willing to work with people of good will to get things done. You cannot be a good Governor unless you are both open to people in both parties but absolutely aggressive in what you believe and what you want to achieve. You need both an agenda and an ability to bring people together. He can do that. And I did this for 12 years; I'm telling you, this is important, and he can do it superbly well.","The other thing that has not been mentioned—Vic talked about his service in the legislature—he was twice voted, twice, the best member of the Louisiana Legislature. So he knows about this job.","The last thing I'll say is this, and I think it's important. I want to thank Anne and Stan and Chris Rice for having us in this magnificent facility. But this facility used to be an orphanage, and I got to thinking, Hillary and I had a very moving event at the White House this week to celebrate our attempts to move people, kids from foster care into adoption, and all the work we've done over the last 7 years—one thing we have done, by the way, on a bipartisan basis—to speed up adoptions. And I got down here today, and when I was over at the school, a woman stopped me and said, \"Mr. President, thank you for helping to fix the adoption laws. I just adopted two children.\" So we've worked on this.","Now, I want to say that I want you to think about this as a place where children once lived who had no family. This man knows what it's like to have a difficult time. He knows what it's like to have the support of a good family. He knows what it's like to build a good family, and he and his wife have five magnificent daughters who have done superbly well because they have good parents and a good home.","In the end, having now served 12 years as a Governor and 7 years as President, I can tell you, a lot of times you have to make decisions that nobody is smart enough to make. A lot of times decisions come to me that, no matter how smart I think I am, I cannot think my way through. And all you can do is pray to God to give you the wisdom to do it, and listen to your heart, not your head.","So the last thing I'll say is, remember everything—the man has proven he's had the courage to take a tough decision. He cast a decisive vote on the most important bill that brought us the prosperity we enjoy today. He has wide experience in State Government. He has the capacity to get people together. He clearly has the right agenda. There is no more important agenda for Louisiana's future than getting the education up to world-class levels.","But when it's all said and done, what really counts is, do you have a good heart. Keep in mind, 50 years later I still remember my mother loved me enough to kneel down on those railroad tracks and cry when I had to go away. When it's all said and done, you don't remember first and foremost in the last moments of your life the honors you had, the riches you had; you remember who you liked and who you loved, how it felt when the seasons changed, and what it felt like to be really, really important, to matter in the lives of other people. The people of Louisiana will matter to Bill Jefferson if he is the Governor.","I agree with what has been said. You should only vote for him if you think he'd be the best Governor. But if you think he'd be the best Governor and you let him be defeated, it would be a terrible thing, because the children here, the children of this State deserve the very best person they can get in experience, in mind, and in heart.","Thank you. God bless you."]}

We need some new approaches.","For that reason I have directed the Secretary to prepare a major report on transportation and a policy for the future.","That will not come tomorrow, and it won't come in a week or a month. We hope that within the next 6 months .that report will be available so that we can do some advance planning.","In addition, the Secretary will be able to answer some questions today on the SST and other problems in which you may be interested.","I did want to appear with the group because of the importance of the assignments that they will undertake, and I think we have some high-quality men who have a vision about the future and are not simply going to try to administer the programs of the past."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmeetingwithamericanindianleaders","text":["Secretary Kleppe, let me welcome each and every one of you to the White House this afternoon. I am extremely happy to have the opportunity to meet with you individually as well as collectively, and I am very proud to have the distinguished leaders and the elected representatives of America's Indian tribes here in the East Room of the White House.","I looked over your schedule and I hope from the distinguished speakers that spoke with you that you have had an informative briefing session, not only with Secretary Kleppe but the others--those who were responsible for some of the Government Indian programs. I think it is vitally important that you tell us what your problems are, what your needs are, and then we can be fully informed as to the right policies and the right programs.","Let me take just a few minutes to talk with you on a personal basis, to let you know of my personal concern for the needs of Indians and Native Americans. The Federal Government has a very unique relationship with you and your people. It is a relationship of a legal trust and a high moral responsibility. That relationship is rooted deep in history, but it is fed today by our concern that the Indian people should enjoy the same opportunities as other Americans, while maintaining the culture and the traditions that you rightly prize as your heritage.","That heritage is an important part of the American culture that we are celebrating in this great country in our Bicentennial Year. Your contribution has been both material and spiritual. Your ancestors introduced settlers not only to new foods and new plants but to Indian ways of life and Indian values which they absorbed. This is a year for all of us to realize what a great debt we individually and collectively owe to the American Indians.","Today you are concerned about such serious problems as poverty, unemployment, crime, poor health, and unsuitable housing on Indian reservations. I share your concern. I am hopeful about the future and about what we can achieve by continuing to work together.","The 1970's have brought a new era in Indian affairs. In the last century, Federal policy has vacillated between paternalism and the threat of terminating Federal responsibility. I am opposed to both extremes. I believe in maintaining a stable policy so that Indians and Indian leaders can plan and work confidently for the future.","We can build on that foundation to improve the opportunities available to American Indians and, at the same time, make it possible for you to live as you choose within your tribal structure and in brotherhood with your fellow citizens.","We have already begun to build. My administration is supporting the concept of allowing Indian tribes to determine whether they and their members, in addition to being under tribal jurisdiction, should be under State or Federal civil and criminal jurisdiction. I have directed the Departments of Justice and Interior to draft legislation which would accomplish this goal efficiently, effectively, and within adequate guidelines. They have solicited the views of the Indian community in preparing their recommendations, which I will soon send to the Congress.","I am committed to furthering the self-determination of Indian communities but without terminating the special relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian people. I am strongly opposed to termination. Self-determination means that you can decide the nature of your tribe's relationship with the Federal Government within the framework of the Self-Determination Act, which I signed in January of 1975.","Indian tribes, if they desire, now have the opportunity to administer Federal programs for themselves. We can then work together as partners. On your part, this requires initiative and responsibility as you define your tribal goals and determine how you want to use the Federal resources. On the Federal Government's part, self-determination for Indian tribes requires that Federal programs must be flexible enough to deal with the different needs and desires of individual tribes.","In the past, our flexibility has been limited by the lack of effective coordination among departments and agencies offering a wide variety of programs and services to the Indian people. Programs serving both reservation and nonreservation Indians are spread across half a dozen different Cabinet departments involving agencies ranging from the Economic Development Administration to the Federal Aviation Administration.","As many of you know, this is Ted Marrs' last day on the White House staff. Ted's service as White House Liaison for Indian Affairs has been invaluable to me as [SPEAKER] and to the Cabinet officers and, I am confident, to the Indian community. With his departure, I will announce shortly the name of a person who will assume Ted Marrs' duties in the Office of Public Liaison in the area of Indian affairs. This appointee will be an individual with responsibility to work with the Cabinet officers, with the Office of Management and Budget, with the Domestic Council, and with my legal office to encourage the improved coordination of the various Federal agencies and programs that currently serve the Indian population.","As an additional step in this direction, I am also sending a memorandum to the heads of all Cabinet departments with Indian responsibilities, directing them to give priority attention to the coordination of Indian programs. These two actions will help to ensure that $1½ billion spent annually on Indian programs and services will be spent efficiently, with cooperation, and without duplication.","An important task we can help you with is the challenge of economic development of your lands. I congratulate you on the initiative that you have shown. I pledge encouragement. I pledge help in your efforts to create long-term economic development.","Many Indian reservations contain valuable natural resources. There must be the proper treatment of these resources with respect for nature, which is a traditional Indian value. My Attorney General has established an Indian resources section whose sole responsibility is litigation on behalf of Indian tribes to protect your natural resources and your jurisdictional rights.","Indian leaders and the Indian people have gained an increasing skill in managing these resources so they benefit your tribes and our Nation as a whole. I wholeheartedly and unequivocally pledge our cooperation in working with you to improve the quality of Indian life by providing soundly managed programs and a stable policy.","We can make the 'rest of the 1970's decisive years in the lives of the Indian people. Together, we can write a new chapter in the history of this land that we all serve and this land that we all share.","I thank you very much."]}

It's a great honor to be here at SAIS. I've been fortunate to count a lot of SAIS graduates and SAIS faculty among my friends, indeed, I see many friends and colleagues in the audience. Thanks for being here. This is a place that is synonymous with professionalism, with hard work and with influence on the important issues of foreign and defense policy around the world.","I've been told that this speech is also being broadcast live on the worldwide web, and so for those of you who are sitting in your offices or your home, or even at a classroom in Nanjing or in Bologna, welcome, and thanks for taking the time to tune in.","I'd like to thank Steve Szabo very much, the Interim Dean of SAIS, for the opportunity to be here. Jessica Einhorn, the Dean Designate and a good friend; congratulations on your recent appointment, Jessica. To Bill Brody, the President of Johns Hopkins, and his wife, Wendy, who leave this university so very, very well, thank you. To Dorothy Rostov and Gene Rostov, the widow and son of Charles Rostov, thank you for sponsoring this lecture. As a former provost, I know how important it is to have that kind of support.","To Paul Nitze and his wife, Leezee, it's an honor to have you here. Not only are you good friends, but Paul, your decades of service and your visionary work in containing the Soviet Union and giving America a vision that was transformative and that was realized 50 years later is something that George Shultz has perhaps put best, that \"wise men come and wise men go, but one wise man goes on and on.\" And, Paul, we're very glad for that.","Zbig Brzezinski, also a former National Security Advisor -- we have a little club that we hold. (Laughter.) Zbig, it's nice to have you here. And to Cliff Wharton, who is a good friend and a graduate of SAIS, as well to the members of the Advisory Council, thank you very much for this opportunity.","As Steve said, I was originally scheduled to be here on September 11th, and I thought I would speaking. Instead, I ended up, after a few hours in a White House bunker, trying to deal with the effects of a huge terrorist attack on the United States. None of us will ever forget where we were when we heard the news that particular day.","I, myself, was standing at my desk in the White House, and I was waiting to go down to my senior staff meeting, when my executive assistant handed me a note that said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. And my first thought was, what a terrible accident. And I called the President and he said essentially the same thing, he was in Florida, he said, what a terrible accident.","And, of course, first reports are always wrong. First we thought it was a twin engine plane, and then later we learned it was a commercial airliner. And I went down for my senior staff meeting and about three people into the staff meeting, as I was asking for reports, I got a note from my executive assistant that said a second plane has hit the World Trade Center. And I thought, my God, it's a terrorist attack.","And I walked into the Situation Room to try to gather together the national security principals for a session, a meeting, and I was trying to reach Don Rumsfeld and I couldn't. And I looked behind me, and a plane had hit the Pentagon. And there were reports that there were car bombs at the State Department and that airplanes were headed for the White House.","It is one of those events that foreign policy professionals spend their lives talking about and thinking about and studying -- and perhaps even exercising for, as I'm one who believes in teaching from decision simulations -- but you hope to God that you'll never actually face it.","Indeed, we did face it, as a country and as a world. In the hours and days that followed, the President set the broad outlines of a strategy to address what had happened to us. And, of course, as a part of that, he ordered the Pentagon to quickly develop a military strategy for Afghanistan, which was obviously the center, the home base from which this attack had taken place.","Now, that plan was truly outside the box for the simple reason that the American military did not have on the shelf a plan that said: your ground forces will be on horseback, but they'll be complemented by 21st century air power. It took a little, shall we say, adaptive planning to figure out exactly how to make that work. But we quickly did adapt to the new conditions that faced us. And the President, who wanted to use America's military forces deliberately but decisively, was able to do so.","The results speak for themselves: al Qaeda has been deprived of its home base; its leadership is on the run; many of its operatives have been captured or killed; the Taliban regime has been routed; Afghanistan has been transformed from a terrorist-sponsored state into a country led by people who are trying to create a better future.","There remains much work to be done on many fronts, from military operations to law enforcement to intelligence sharing to cutting off terrorist financing. The war on terrorism has many aspects, not just military aspects, and we are pursuing them all. Patient and focused leadership has brought us thus far, and we believe that it will carry us through to victory.","It's going to take years to understand the long-term effects of September 11th. But even now we are beginning to recognize that there are certain verities that September 11th reinforced and brought home to us in the most vivid way.","First, there has been an end to innocence about international politics and about our own vulnerability. We see that wars of consequence are not mere relics of a bygone era. We see that in years to come the primary energies of America's Armed Forces will be devoted to more than just managing civil conflict and humanitarian assistance.","As the world's most powerful nation, the United States has a special responsibility to help make the world more secure. And when we were attacked on September 11th, it reinforced one of the rediscovered truths about today's world: robust military power matters in international politics and in security.","Second, the events of September 11th underscored the idea that a sound foreign policy begins at home. We are now engaged in trying to harden the country. That means thinking about airport security, visa requirements, protection of nuclear power plants and other physical and cyber security infrastructure.","We also are working with the American Armed Forces to make certain that the role of America's Armed Forces, in defending our territory, our airspace, our land and our sea, is properly taken care of. And that is why Secretary Rumsfeld and Chairman Myers have proposed the creation of a U.S. Northern Command -- having America's Armed Forces cover for the first time the American continent, wholly consistent with American constitutional responsibilities and expectations, but with a new understanding that America's frontiers need to be safe.","In doing so, we recognize that we have to secure our own neighborhood, not just America's borders. And we are now cooperating with Mexico and Canada in unprecedented ways to construct smart and modern borders -- borders that protect us from those who would harm us, but facilitate the trade and human interchange that enrich us.","Since the earliest days of the campaign for President, President Bush has stated his determination to build a fully democratic western hemisphere that lives and trades in freedom and grows in prosperity. Strong, prosperous neighbors export their goods, not their problems -- like drugs and terror.","The third truth is that we can only do so much to protect ourselves at home, and so the best defense is a good offense. We have to take the fight to the terrorists. And that means that there can be no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. So in addition to pursuing al Qaeda, we have also pursued the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan, as we knew that they had shared responsibilities for the terrorist attacks.","Now with the Taliban out of power and al Qaeda damaged, we have moved into the second stage of our war on terror. But let's be very clear: much remains to be done in Afghanistan. Ultimately, Afghanistan will be secured by more democracy and more prosperity. This great project is not America's alone and it will require a broad range of tools. We need to help Afghanistan build up its political institutions, its economic institutions and its civil society. Building a nation is not an American military task -- it is a joint project, a long-term project between the Afghan people and the international community.","Beyond Afghanistan, we are engaged in a sustained campaign to deny sanctuary to terrorists, regardless of where they are from and where they commit their crimes. Our message to every leader on every continent is that terrorism can support no cause, it is never, never legitimate; it is, by its very nature, evil; terrorists have no positive agenda; terrorists are not for anything, they are against peace and freedom and life, itself.","Recent events in the Middle East illustrate the terrible damage, the terrible toll of terrorism. Innocent lives are being lost. People who could be living together in peace are being driven apart by death and destruction. And on April 4th, the President called on all parties -- Israel, the Palestinians and regional leaders among the Arab neighbors -- to accept their responsibilities to create an environment free from violence and terror.","A fourth truth that September 11th underscored was the need to deny terrorists and hostile states the opportunity to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The world's most dangerous people simply cannot be permitted to obtain the world's most dangerous weapons. And it is a stubborn and extremely troubling fact that the list of states that sponsor terror and the lists of states that are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction overlap substantially.","We do not see how these facts can be denied. And if these facts are admitted, they must be confronted. We must use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat, including strengthened nonproliferation regimes and export controls, and moving ahead with missile defense to deny any benefit to those who would try and acquire weapons of mass destruction.","The United States and our coalition partners must act deliberately. But inaction is not an option. As the President has said, we must not and we will not wait on events while dangers gather.","Finally, the new challenges have underscored the critical importance of allies, partners and coalitions. Global terror demands a global solution. Right now there are 20 countries with forces operating in and around Afghanistan, one of the largest military coalitions assembled since the Gulf War. And there are many who are not a part of the military coalition who are providing important intelligence, law enforcement and efforts to cut off terrorist financing.","In this we have been tremendously helped by our allies around the world. And our NATO allies have particularly led the way, especially Britain, which heads the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan and has sent air and naval and special forces into the region. America will never forget that within 24 hours of the attacks, NATO, for the first time in its history, invoked Article V of its charter, stating that an attack on one is an attack on all.","We will continue to work closely with our friends and our allies as the war progresses and as we seek victory over the scourge of terrorism.","These enduring truths, made more vivid by September 11th, are very important to centering our foreign policy. But there is one other important truth from this period: an earthquake of the magnitude of 9/11 can shift the tectonic plates of international politics. The international system has been in flux since the collapse of Soviet power. Now it is possible -- indeed, probable -- that that transition is coming to an end.","If that is right, if the collapse of the Soviet Union and 9/11 bookend a major shift in international politics, then this is a period not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity. Before the clay is dry again, America and our friends and our allies must move decisively to take advantage of these new opportunities. This is, then, a period akin to 1945 to 1947, when American leadership expanded the number of free and democratic states -- Japan and Germany among the great powers -- to create a new balance of power that favored freedom.","It is, indeed, possible to see age-old problems in a new light. And, as an academic, may I suggest, to put aside age-old distinctions between realism and neoliberalism in thinking about the task ahead. Put more simply than any of its proponents would find acceptable, realists downplay the importance of values and the internal structures of states, emphasizing instead the balance of power as the key to stability and peace. Neoliberals emphasize the primacy of values, such as freedom and democracy and human rights and institutions in ensuring that a just political order is obtained.","As a professor, I recognize that these debates enliven our conferences and our classrooms. (Laughter.) I have participated in them, myself. In fact, most of us got tenure because we participated in them. (Laughter.) But as a policymaker, I can tell you that they obscure reality. Power matters. Great powers matter. Great powers matter because they can influence international stability for good or for ill due their size, influence and their will. Great powers never have, and never will, just mind their own business within their borders.","Thus, the Soviet Union's collapse was important both because it resolved a high-stakes struggle that profoundly affected world peace and security, but also because values and ideas, democracy, markets and freedom triumphed. The socialist alternative that had existed for 70-plus years, which kept so much of the world isolated from the international economy and deprived so many millions of the benefits of freedom, died alongside the hammer and the sickle.","Our goal today, then, is not just a favorable balance of power, but what President Bush has called a balance of power that favors freedom.","After the end of the Cold War, and still in the shadow of September 11th, we may well be on the cusp of an era in which the world will not be bedeviled by great power rivalry. There will be differences among the great powers. But if the scales tip toward shared interest, rather than interest in conflict between them, this will truly be an era unlike any other.","September 11th and its aftermath illuminated a fundamental divide between the forces of chaos and those of order. And all the world's great powers clearly see themselves as falling on the same side of this divide, and they are acting accordingly.","Europe and the United States see that our common and fundamental interests and values far outweigh our differences. When people are trying to kill you, and when they attack because they hate freedom, other disputes -- from Franken-food to bananas to even important issues like the environment -- suddenly look a bit different. They look like policy differences, not fundamental clashes of values.","Germany and Japan have begun to adopt new security roles that correspond with their identities as leading powers and democracies. Russia's democratic transition is by no means yet complete. Yet, September 11th has helped to clarify elements of a common security agenda with Russia. We have also worked cooperatively on a range of issues with India, an emerging democratic power, even as we work closely with Pakistan. And we are optimistic about the future of our relationship with China, a country in the midst of a fundamental and still uncertain transition. But the emergence of a China that embraces the rule of law, markets and, ultimately, democracy would have a profound and positive effect on world security and prosperity.","A balance of power that favors freedom is, at its core, a balance of power based on the ascendancy of shared values on every continent. That is why in places such as Russia and China, values matter. They matter in our relations and they matter to the outcome of the balance of power that favors freedom -- values like religious freedom, media freedom and a recognition of the aspirations of long suffering minority groups. It is not enough for the great powers to share an interest in order; we need to move to sharing an interest in an order that is based on common values.","America today possesses as much power and influence as any nation or entity in the world, and certainly in history. But in stark contrast to the leading powers of centuries past, our ambitions are not territorial. Our military and economic power are complemented by and multiplied by the values that underpin them: democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law, honest government, respect for women and children, private property, free speech, equal justice and religious tolerance.","That is why America seeks a great world beyond the victory over terror. We seek not merely to leave the world safer, but to leave it better; to leave it a world that makes it possible for all men and women to experience the exhilaration and the challenges of freedom. This mission to leave the world safer and better is more important than ever in the face of September 11th. That is why President Bush is strongly committed to free trade as a cornerstone of American policy -- trade that advances economic growth at home and abroad and advances the forces of freedom, as well.","That is why in Monterrey, Mexico last month the President put forth a new compact for global development defined by greater resources from wealthy nations and greater responsibility from developing nations. That fund will benefit poor countries, especially in Africa, but also in Latin America. The President pledged to seek a 50 percent increase in America's core development assistance, with new funds devoted to projects and nations that govern justly, invest in their people and encourage economic freedom.","There is also a new urgency to address our relations with Muslim societies around the world in a positive way. This war in which we are engaged is not a clash of civilizations; it cannot be a clash of civilizations. Extremism and progress are most assuredly enemies of one another. But you do not have to reject tradition and belief to reap the benefits of integration into modern society.","This was the central insight of Pakistan President Musharraf's speech on January 12th. And as President Bush recognized in his speech, the State of the Union, all fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence. The United States will stand with people on every continent, in Muslim societies and in all societies that seek to claim a better future for their people.","Education will play a particularly important role in societies that are making this quest. A good education teaches an appreciation of practical skills for the global economy. But is also provides a forum in which one learns to live with difference and to respect the rights of others. It fuels new hopes, instead of old hatreds.","Americans have a deep understanding of the ability of education to open you up to the full range of possibilities. At Stanford, I was always heartened to stand before a class in which a fourth-generation Stanford legatee sat next to the son or daughter of a migrant farm worker. It reinforced that education is the great equalizer. Because after that experience, it would not matter where they came from, it would matter where they were going.","Here at SAIS, there are not only diverse students from a collection of American families, but also people from different backgrounds and from different countries -- some 70 nations. The common experience shared here by students, many of whom will go on to leadership roles here and in their own countries, will influence choices for a long, long time to come. And choices are important. Our continued success in the fight against terror, our success in making the world safer and better hinges on the choices made by the rest of the world.","America cannot impose its vision on the world -- yet, we will use our influence to favor freedom. There are right and wrong choices and right and wrong acts. And governments are making them every day for their own people and for the people of the world. We can never let the intricacies of cloistered debate -- with its many hues of gray and nuance -- obscure the need to speak and act with moral clarity. We must recognize that some states or leaders will choose wrongly. We must recognize that truly evil regimes will never be reformed. And we must recognize that such regimes must be confronted, not coddled.","Nations must decide which side they are on in the fault line that divides civilization from terror. They must decide whether to embrace the paradigm of progress: democracy and freedom and human rights, and clean limited government. Together, with others, we can help people and nations make positive choices as they seek a better future, and we can deter those who want to take away a better future for others.","September 11th reintroduced America to a part of itself that some had forgotten, or that some thought we no longer had. We have been reminded that defending freedom was not just the work of the greatest generation, it is the work of every generation. And we will carry this better part of ourselves out into the wider world.","Thank you very much.","MR. SZABO: Thank you so much for that superb lecture. I know the faculty really appreciated the use of theory in your lecture. (Laughter.) The students were grimacing, but I think they also -- (laughter.)","We're going to open the questions up to the SAIS community, and I have two questions that I will intersperse at some point that we have from Bologna, but let's open it to some students. We have one shy student in the front here who will ask the first one.","Q The Bush administration, in your speech you use a lot of moral dichotomies -- there's a fault line, there's the good, the evil. But it seems that the realities of foreign policy are much more complicated than that and America has to engage with some regimes that are either anti-democratic, like Saudi Arabia, or with dubious moral records, Israel. And I think the recent kind of silence regarding the coups in Venezuela shows that it's not always 100 percent for pro-democratic regimes as well.","I was wondering if you feel that this moral rhetoric, but combined with actions that obviously have to serve our self-interest, create a perception of hypocrisy and threaten America's credibility with our allies and internationally.","DR. RICE: Thank you. No, I don't. That won't surprise you. (Laughter.)","No, it's a very good question. Look, the truth of the matter is, though, unless you know where you're going, unless you're clear about where you're going, you will go nowhere. And what moral clarity gives you is a compass against which to measure everything else -- because you're right, it is a complex world, it's a hard world. The complexities bring you into different kinds of situations in which different tactics are important.","But if you ever lose sight of what you think is wrong and what is right, then you have nothing to guide you. And if you ever lose sight of the fact that there is wrong and right, you have nothing to guide you.","I would cite, for instance, the American struggle for which Paul Nitze is known against the Soviet Union. It is absolutely clear that we \"engaged\" the Soviet Union. We entered into large-scale arms control talks and treaties with the Soviet Union to keep from blowing each other up. But we knew the character of the Soviet Union and so we also made certain that we always made room to try and engage around the government of the Soviet Union to people in the Soviet Union.","One of the most interesting aspects of the end of the Cold War, the periods of between '88 and '91, was the degree to which a lot of people who had been a part of exchanges with the United States, scholarly exchanges and others, emerged from that to be the voice of a new liberalism in the Soviet Union when conditions permitted.","Now, we have to do the same thing now. The fact is that when you are engaging with a state that, shall we say, has not yet met the test democratically, you have to say so. I was recently in a meeting with the President, with a central Asian leader, with Karimov, in which he said to him, yes, I appreciate what you've done in the war on terrorism, this is terrific and we're glad that we were able to deal with the IMU; our relationship will get stronger as you reform economically and politically. And you can never leave those words out of any such conversation.","Let me just speak briefly to Venezuela because, in fact, the United States did speak out against anti-constitutional means both publicly and privately. We did make very clear that we believe that democratically elected governments could not be overthrown by extraconstitutional means. But the threat to democracy in Venezuela didn't begin with those people in the streets. We have to remember that Chavez also, in shutting down the press, for instance, was doing things to harm Venezuelan democracy long before that fateful outcome.","Now, we're all very hopeful that what he has said -- which is that he plans to be self-reflective and the nation needs to be self-reflective -- will lead him to recognize the importance of democratic values for real, not just claiming that because you're elected you are exercising democratic values. We cannot fall into that trap. When people are elected, they especially have a responsibility to follow democratic values and we have to call it for what we see. But we were very strong in this and, in fact, joined with countries in the region to talk about the importance of respecting democratic processes.","Q President Bush has said Iran is part of the axis of evil. However, in the last few years, countries like Italy and Germany have pursued a fruitful open-door policy in regard to Tehran. Do you think that a more flexible and realist policy by the U.S. towards Iran could be in the political and economic interests of the U.S., itself.","DR. RICE: Well, I think that the problem with Iran is that its policies unfortunately belie the notion that engagement with it has helped. It has been engaged -- I mean, Great Britain has relations with Iran. A number of our European allies have relations with Iran.","Our problem with Iran is in policies that are so destructive to international politics -- from the support of terrorism around the world to the support of terrorism in the Middle East and, frankly, the un-elected few in Iran who continue to frustrate the hopes of their own people, who repeatedly turn out and vote to throw off tyranny. There are an un-elected few who continue to frustrate the hopes of the people. And we're simply speaking the truth about the nature of Iran.","Now, the truth is we've had some useful interaction with Iran around Afghanistan. Iran is Afghanistan's neighbor. We expect Iran to have good relations with Afghanistan, but they need to be transparent relations, they should be relations that are state to state, not relations that try to play into the complex and difficult politics of Iran.","So I think that our view is that the behavior of Iran at this point would suggest that it is a state that while there may be some positive forces within it, those positive forces are not quite yet capable of changing the nature of Iran's behavior; Iran's behavior continues to be a major problem in international politics. And we watch the developments with great interest, but Iranian behavior puts it squarely in the axis of evil -- whether it is weapons of mass destruction or terrorism or any of those things. It's a complicated situation, but I think the behavior speaks for itself.","Q I have a question about democracy being a compass. I understand that the idea, the American foreign policy idea is to sort of influence the development of democracies. However, some nations, it seems to me, may not be either ready or on the verge of becoming democratic. And so if this is sort of pushed on them or imposed it could create instability and chaos. And is there -- my first question is, is there not a need to respect a pace at which democracy can actually be established in certain countries?","And, second of all, if we look at reform, for example, in the former Soviet Union, as well as China, and then we see that the fast pace at which reforms occurred in the Soviet Union led to chaos and a bit of anarchy -- and, of course, we see that in China, the progress is a lot slower -- do you think there's a need for shock therapy? Is it better, is it better for preserving stability?","DR. RICE: Thank you. It's a very good question. I would hate as a policymaker to have to make the choice of who's ready for democracy and who isn't. And I think that it is really not our responsibility to try and divide countries into, if you will, tiers with whom you push democracy because they're kind of ready and those that might not quite be ready because of chaos and instability.","First of all, whenever we've tried to do that, whenever we've tried to make judgments about who's ready and who's not, we've almost always been wrong. Because societies that -- particularly societies that are tyrannical are brittle very often inside, and are opaque to us.","And so I think our better response is to be clear about the importance of democratic development, to press the agenda on behalf of people whom from within these societies are trying to bring about democratic change, to offer a hand to those countries that are in transition and to provide tools that might help the democratic transition.","You mentioned China. While none of us believe that just because China joined the World Trade Organizations its democratic development is assured -- nobody believes that -- but we do recognize that some of the things that China will do as a part of its WTO membership -- whether it's rule of law or transparency or giving greater economic freedom to entrepreneurs -- will change the political landscape in China. So there are lots of different ways to go about this.","I do think we need to recognize, too, that just holding an election is not democracy. It is a first step, but democratic consolidation takes some time. And even mature democracies like our own take a long time to get all of the pieces right. I'm often fond of saying, you know, when the Founding Fathers said \"we, the people\" they didn't mean \"me.\" (Laughter.) And it's taken us a little while to get that piece of it right.","So we should recognize that democracy is something that you build brick by brick, step by step. But unless you recognize that it is a universal aspiration of all people to be free, unless you recognize that given a choice between tyranny and freedom people will choose freedom, you will always be surprised by how much that is true. We just saw it again in Afghanistan. People said, well, is Afghanistan after 20 years of civil war and Taliban, maybe they're not quite ready. Yes, well, the democratic transition there is going to be hard. But if you have any doubt that these people wanted to be freed from the tyranny of the Taliban and that they want a chance at democratic development, you should just talk to the many people now who are trying to help them get there.","So I don't think we should make those choices. I think we have to be firm in our belief in the values, I think we have to press the values. And I think we have to provide opportunities for leaders to make the right choices. Right now we are fortunate in that many of the incentives are very powerful -- to give your people greater creativity and greater freedom. Because the truth of the matter is, economic development in the modern world is dependent on human potential. And human potential does not flourish in tyrannies. And so the incentives to freedom and to greater freedom are very strong. I think we have to press them.","As to China and Russia, I think I would read what happened in Russia a little bit differently. Yes, it was chaotic and it was scary sometimes. But I would never be one to say that the fact that political change preceded economic change was a bad thing for Russia. Indeed, it may well be that when economic change now begins to catch up that some of the political circumstances are stronger and more in place. They've still got a very long way to go, and this consolidation of democracy in Russia will take a very long time. But I have no doubt that the political changes that created a kind of pluralism were for the good, not for the bad.","Q I wanted to know, in your remarks today you said that regimes that coddled terrorists will, in your words, be confronted and not coddled. The Palestinian regime for the last several weeks has invited terrorists into their headquarters -- and these are known individuals who have participated in assassinations -- and has given them safe haven.","How far does a regime have to go before it will meet that criteria and be confronted and not coddled? Thank you very much.","DR. RICE: Well, we've been very clear with Chairman Arafat and with the Palestinian Authority that we expect, and the world expects them to live up to their responsibilities to rid themselves of any terrorist influences that may be close to or associated with the Palestinian Authority.","We have even given them ways to do it. One of the things that we're doing in our policy is to offer assistance to any leader who wishes to get rid of terrorism. We're doing it with Shevardnadze in Georgia, we're doing it with Salih in Yemen, and with the Palestinian Authority. That is essentially what the Tenet work plan is -- it is a way to deal with the security environment and to arrest and to bring to justice terrorists.","I don't think that there is any doubt in anyone's mind that we've not been fully happy with the response -- we've been disappointed in the response. But the context in the Middle East in which the war on terrorism cannot be fought solely by military means and in which you need the cooperation of the states in the region and you need the cooperation, indeed, of the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorists, we're willing to keep trying and we are trying.","Now, the arrangement that was made over the weekend in which these prisoners are being transferred and are going to be taken care of in a custodial fashion by British and American wardens is one way to help move this process forward. But let me be very clear. The President, when he made his speech on April 4th, was more clear, or was clearer than any American President has been in a very, very long time of what was expected of all the parties.","Peace in the Middle East is not easy. If it had been easy, we would have had it by now. And the reason that it's not easy is that everybody in the region has to do some difficult things in order to achieve it: Israel has to do difficult things to come into conformity with 242 and 338, and to create the conditions for a Palestinian state; the Arab neighbors of Israel have a lot of work to do to bring about the condition for normalization of relations with Israel and to make certain that terror is not incited from their own territories. It is simply not acceptable to have some of the incitement of terror that you've had in the Arab world, and we've made that very clear.","And, finally, the Palestinian Authority has a lot of work to do to actually meet lead its people in a way that does not incite and does not give way to people's concerns and people's hostilities but, rather, gives them another path toward economic development and prosperity. It's a hard road for everybody, but we believe that we've laid out a road map and we're going to pursue it step by step.","Q To follow up on the question on morality. Iraq's current regime clearly belongs to America's worst enemies. Its defense potential, however, might be strengthened by some foreign leaders who also claim to be friends with the United States. One of them, Ukrainian President Kuchma, had been allegedly taped while agreeing to sell to Iraq four advanced air defense systems capable of tracking stealth bombers. The tape with allegedly Kuchma's voice was authenticated by American forensic experts. And U.S. military intelligence also confirmed that Iraq, indeed, possesses such radar systems.","What measures is the United States government currently taking to investigate this allegation? What consequences might Kuchma face if the allegations are confirmed? And, more broadly, how should the United States deal with those regimes who support its war against terror on words, but help its enemies in deeds? Thank you.","DR. RICE: Sergei also was my research assistant at Stanford, so there's a little bit of a Stanford/SAIS connection here. (Laughter.) Hi, nice to see you. (Laughter.)","Let me start, Sergei, with the last part of the question, which is how to respond to regimes that are publicly or rhetorically supportive of the war on terrorism and perhaps doing things that are not so helpful. And there are a couple of things. First of all, we've been pretty clear with everybody that when we discover that there is that inconsistency, that we expect the inconsistency to be addressed, and that it would have very severe consequences for U.S.-fill-in-the-blank relations if, in fact, that inconsistency is not addressed.","In some cases, it has been a matter of saying to countries, all right, you may not have the capacity to address terrorism in your own midst; maybe that's what you're saying when you do nothing while saying you support the war on terrorism. We will help you in those circumstances, and to offer intelligence and the like.","I have to say that for the most part, the number of countries in that category is pretty small. We've been pretty impressed with the degree to which countries are not just rhetorically supportive of, but actually supportive of the war on terrorism. And I think there's a reason for that, which is that terrorism and its ugly face is actually a threat to a lot of regimes, not just to us. And so we've tended to get extremely good cooperation.","As to Ukraine, I don't want to comment on the specific example because there's a lot that's gone on there and I don't want to comment on what is really still an allegation. But I will say that we have talked very seriously to the Ukrainian regime about some of the issues of proliferation that we are concerned about with the Ukrainian regime.","We consider U.S.-Ukrainian relations to be potentially extremely important to stability, particularly in southern Europe. Ukraine is a huge country, 50 million people. It's a country that borders on extremely important countries like Russia, and it is a country that has a past of being able to cooperate with the West in other periods of time -- a people that have been able to cooperate with the West in other periods of time.","So we're seeking good relations. But we are -- we have let the Ukrainian government know that the proliferation issues are extremely important not just in the war on terrorism, but, for instance, in the Balkans, as well. We've been very clear about that, and U.S.-Ukrainian relations will progress more strongly when there's some action on some of those items.","Q I'm the Director of the Western Hemisphere Program at SAIS. Argentina is in a profound crisis. It raises a number of very important security and economic issues for the United States. Some would argue that if this were Turkey or Brazil or Mexico, aid would have been forthcoming by now. Is there some point at which we in Washington -- the \"iffies\" and the administration -- should really call time out, the social crisis is increasing; the political polarization is very deep, and provide economic support?","DR. RICE: Well, President Bush made very clear to President Duhalde not too long after he came to power that Argentina is extremely important to the United States and to the regional powers, and that we are going to be there for, and be supportive of Argentina. The fact is, though, Argentina has to do some difficult things. And Argentina is in very intense discussions with the IMF about how to move forward. It has now taken a hiatus to go home and to try to see if it can arrange politically to be able to do some of the things that it needs to be able to do.","It is not an unwillingness to have international assistance go to Argentina. It is an understanding that the conditions have to be right so that those resources actually make a difference. And some of the things that Argentina needs to do will improve confidence in Argentina just by doing them.","There was a huge disbursement of resources to Argentina, I believe $8 billion in August. It did not stem the crisis because the conditions were not right. And so it has to be a combination of willingness to provide resources, but also understanding that circumstances are not always right in which resources will make a difference.","Now, we are in constant contact with the Argentines. We fully believe that if they can just do the things that the IMF is requesting that they do, we believe that they can find a way back to sustainable growth. The President talks frequently to other leaders in the region, as well, because we recognize that this is not just U.S.-Argentina, this is about the whole hemisphere. But Argentina has, and should know that it has no better friend than the United States, and that it has a friend that will be willing to help and to advocate on its behalf for resources at the time at which they would make a difference toward sustainable growth. And that's where we are.","Q I'd like to go back to the Middle East again and ask you to comment on the Abdallah plan. What is it that keeps us from giving it a full endorsement as the beginning of a process to end Israeli terrorism and Palestinian terrorism?","DR. RICE: Thank you. The President had an opportunity this weekend, of course, to be with Crown Prince Abdallah over an extended period of time. They not only spent time in the kind of normal expanded -- well, it wasn't very expanded, it was a small group to begin with -- but they spent a good deal of time alone, talking about the future. And the President told the Crown Prince very strongly how important he thought his leadership was in stepping up with a plan.","Every element of it may not be workable. Some of it would have to be negotiated in terms of borders and the like. But we need to keep our eye on the big picture here, and the promise of deeper Saudi engagement in the peace process would be a tremendous breakthrough for the entire process.","The truth of the matter is that while we all focus very heavily on the Israeli-Palestinian piece of this, this, of course, takes place in a regional context. It takes place in the context in which Israel has to have security with its neighbors; it has to have normal relations with its neighbors, like it has with Egypt and Jordan. It needs to move to normal relations with the other Arab states. And the Arab states, who also have a stake in the way that the Israel-Palestinian issues are resolved, have to have a stake in the final outcome of those negotiations.","So we believe that what the Saudi initiative most represents is a new impetus to have Saudi engaged as Jordan and Egypt have been in bringing peace to the region as a whole. And so we have been extremely positive about it; we've embraced the concept in large parts of it. We understand that there are some things that really are matters of negotiation. But we think it's a tremendously powerful tool and extremely important step in this long-running conflict.","Thank you."]}

So now it's all business. [Laughter]","Let me start by thanking Jim Messina and Jon Carson and all the OFA staff for the great work that they do each and every day. I've gotten a lot of compliments from a lot of you about the quality of the OFA staff, and I actually concur that they are terrific and passionate about the work that we're doing out there.","I just had a chance to talk to some of the leaders from States and communities all across the country who are pounding the pavement and talking to their neighbors and talking to their friends. And the levels of enthusiasm and energy that they projected was inspiring, and it really reminds me of why what I do in the White House matters, because I got folks like that—out on the ground, out in communities every single day—that are counting on me to give voice to the incredible work that they're doing, but also the values that they represent.","And I want to thank all of you. As I look around the room, I would not be President if it were not for this room. And there are a lot of people here who are new friends, but there are also some folks here who supported me way back in the day when I had no gray hair and I didn't wear a tie. Somebody just showed me a picture the other day, and I looked really young. [Laughter]","Most of this is just going to be a conversation. I want to spend time on questions and answers and dialogue and discussion. But let me just make a couple of quick comments.","Number one, as I said at the State of the Union Address, I genuinely think this year can be a breakout year for America. We have now really consolidated the recovery. If you look at the statistics—8.5 million new jobs, unemployment rate the lowest it's been since before I was elected; you've got manufacturing coming back; we've made progress on energy, fuel efficiency, carbon emissions reductions; making steady progress in terms of reforming our education system—we're actually poised to make the 21st century the American century, just like the 20th century was.","And Alan Solomont is over here nodding his head. Alan was representing the United States and did an outstanding job in Spain. And one of the remarkable things that I think he will affirm is that everybody outside of the United States actually thinks that we're doing a remarkable job, that our economic growth is the envy of most of the developed world. And yet that's not always reflected in people's moods here in the States.","And there's a reason for that. Our growth has been uneven. Those of us at the very top have disproportionately benefited from productivity gains, technology, globalization. Middle class families, working class families, still feel like they're struggling every single day to get by. And the ladders of opportunity for folks who want to work their way into the middle class are not as robust as they used to be. And so, even in the midst of recovery, there's still a lot of anxiety out there.","And what I said in the State of the Union was that we have to be focused like a laser on building back up an opportunity society in which everybody feels like if they work hard and if they're responsible, they can get ahead. And that means more jobs; that means making sure people are trained for the jobs that are out there. It means making sure kids get a world-class education. It means that work pays and that not only are they getting a decent paycheck that can support their families, but that they've got retirement security and health care security and all the things that give them a stable platform to live their lives and make sure their kids succeed. So we're doing that.","And I've also said that Congress may not be willing to break gridlock during a Presidential year. I'm going to look for every opportunity to work with them. But if they're not, we're just going to go ahead and do some work.","So just one example: Today at the White House, we announced two more advanced manufacturing hubs, one in Detroit and one in Chicago, where we are going to take cutting-edge research that's being done on advanced metallurgy and digital technology. And consortiums of universities and businesses are coming together to bring jobs back to the United States of America, attract investment. And we didn't have to do that with some legislation, although there is some legislation pending in Congress that could expand it.","We did the same thing to make sure Federal contractors are paying their employees $10.10 an hour. We're doing the same thing when it comes to making sure that we've got high-speed broadband in every classroom in America. I already have a commitment that's going to mean millions of students, about 20 million students, 15,000 schools across America, are going to be wired for broadband. We're doing that in conjunction with the FCC and the private sector. And so we're just going to keep on looking for ways in which we can realize the values that we've been fighting for, for a long time.","But as all of you know because you were involved in 2008 or 2012, it doesn't work if we don't have folks on the ground who are speaking out on behalf of these issues and these values. Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what's necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that's where OFA comes in, because it's able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work. And that grassroots work that is done also then energizes me and informs the issues that we're going to try to lift up over the course of the next year.","So I just want to say to all of you, what you're doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. And you don't always—it's not always flashy. It's often at the ground level, but it makes a difference.","And one final example of that difference that's being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Obviously, nowhere has there been more misinformation, nowhere are just basic facts more contested. But as a consequence of some of the folks that have been doing this work on the ground, as of today, we've signed up more than 4 million people through the exchanges. That's 4 million people who have the security of health care, in many cases for the very first time. And that doesn't count the 3 million who are already able to get health insurance because they're staying on their parent's plan. That doesn't count the millions who have been able to sign up through Medicaid. And we're not done yet.","So when you've got grassroots folks who are committed and energized like they are, it makes a difference. And whatever issues you care about, whether it's climate change or women's reproductive health or foreign policy or education or access to higher education, having folks who are willing to fight for what they believe in connected to what we do here is really powerful and important. And they couldn't do it without you.","So I just wanted to say thank you to all of you."]}

Hillary and I are delighted to welcome all of you here today, including our Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Togo West; the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger; Senator Robb and Congressman Evans; Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre; Secretary Dalton; General Shelton and other members of the Joint Chiefs; General McCaffrey; Deputy Secretary Gober; Mr. Bucha, the president of the Medal of Honor Society, and General Foley and other recipients of the Medal of Honor who are here. To all the commanders of our veterans service organizations and proud members of the United States Marine Corps and former marines, to the friends and the large and wonderful family of General Day and Mrs. Day, we welcome you.","I thank Captain Pucciarelli for the fine invocation. He is not devoid of a sense of humor; before we came out here, he said he was going out to offer the exorcism. ","To those who lived through World War II and those who grew up in the years that followed, few memories inspire more awe and horror than the battle for Okinawa. In the greatest conflict the world has ever known, our forces fought no engagement more bitter or more bloody. In 82 days of fighting, America suffered more than 12,000 dead in this final epic battle, the most costly one during the entire Pacific war.","At the very heart of this crucible was the fight for a hill called Sugar Loaf, the key to breaking the enemy's line across the south of the island, some of the grimmest combat our forces had ever seen. The marines on Sugar Loaf faced a hail of artillery, mortars, and grenades. They were raked by constant machinegun fire. Time and again, our men would claw their way uphill only to be repulsed by the enemy. Progress was measured by the yard.","On May 14th, 1945, a 19-year-old corporal named Jim Day led several other marines to a shell crater on the slope of Sugar Loaf. What happened then surpasses our powers of imagination. On the first day in that isolated hole, Corporal Day and those with him fought off an advance by scores of enemy soldiers. That night he helped to repel three more assaults, as those with him fell dead or injured. Braving heavy fire, he escorted four wounded comrades, one by one, to safety. But he would not stay in safety. Instead, he returned to his position to continue the fight. As one of his fellow marines later reported, the corporal was everywhere. He would run from one spot to another trying to get more fire on the enemy.","When the next day broke, Corporal Day kept on fighting, alone but for one wounded fellow marine. Through assault after assault and into his second night, he fought on. Burned by white phosphorus and wounded by shrapnel, he continued to fire his weapon and hold his ground. He hauled ammunition from a disabled vehicle back to his shellhole and fought and fought, one assault after another, one day, then the next.","The battle on Sugar Loaf decimated two Marine regiments. But when Corporal Jim Day was finally relieved after 3 days of continuous fighting, virtually alone, he had stood his ground.","And the enemy dead around his foxhole numbered more than 100.","His heroism played a crucial part in America's victory at Sugar Loaf. And that success opened the way to the capture of Okinawa and the ultimate triumph of the forces of freedom in the Pacific.","Now, for this extraordinary valor, we recognize James L. Day as one of the bravest of the brave. In words that echo from the peaks of American military history, he has distinguished himself, at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty. As Commander in Chief, I am proud to award General Day our Nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor. This medal confirms what every marine in this room already knows: the name Jim Day belongs in the rolls of the Corps' greatest heroes, alongside Dan Daly, Smedley Butler, Joe Foss, and John Basilone.","General, your achievements leave us all in awe. In particular, it is hard to know whether we should be conferring on you a Medal of Honor for bravery or for modesty.","Let me tell you the story of how we happen to be here today, over 50 years later. Although the battle for Okinawa was still raging when his battlefield commanders nominated young Corporal Day* for this decoration, so many died in the fighting and so many reports were lost in the battle, the paperwork simply never went forward in 1945. General Day later said that awards weren't on their minds in those days. As he put it, \"We just had a job to do, and we wanted to get the job done.\" Years later, when veterans of Sugar Loaf wanted to restart the process, Jim Day forbade them from doing so. Then a general, he felt that seeking such an honor would set a bad example for those he commanded.","General Day, everyone in our Nation, in the military and outside it, can learn a lot from your selfless conduct both under fire and throughout your life. In your modest service, as well as your heroism, you are a shining example to all Americans.","Today, as we applaud one extraordinary performance on Sugar Loaf, we also celebrate one of the most remarkable military careers in our Nation's history. Just days after the action we recall now, Jim Day distinguished himself again on Okinawa and received the Bronze Star for his heroism. During a career that spanned more than four decades, he rose from enlisted man through the ranks to major general, becoming one of the greatest mustangs the Marine Corps ever produced. In Korea, his valor in combat was recognized with two Silver Stars. In Vietnam, his leadership and bravery under fire earned him a third Silver Star. Just as astonishing, for his service in three wars, Jim Day received six Purple Hearts.","General, I'm told that your ability to absorb enemy fire led to a lively debate among those who served with you as to whether it was safer to stand near you or far away.","Amid all this heroism, General Day and his wife have also raised a fine family. He has given not only a lifetime of devotion to the Corps, he and Sally have brought up two more generations of marines: his son, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Day, and grandson, Lance Corporal Joshua Eustice, both of whom are here today, and we welcome you.","General, we thank you for a lifetime lived to the highest standards of patriotism, dedication, and bravery. For all marines and, indeed, for all your fellow Americans, you are the embodiment of the motto Semper Fidelis. You have been unerringly faithful to those who fought alongside you, to the Corps, and to the United States. We are profoundly fortunate to count you among our heroes. On behalf of all Americans, I thank you for a lifetime of service without parallel and for all you have done to preserve the freedom that is our most sacred gift. Thank you, sir."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkspriorcabinetmeetingandexchangewithreporters2","text":["About Search"," ","[SPEAKER]. All right, well, I'm glad to be able to pull together my Cabinet for the first official Cabinet meeting of the year, and I want to wish everybody a wonderful new year.","We've got a lot to do in 2014. As I've said before, this is going to be a year of action. We've seen the economy improve. We want to maximize the pace of our recovery, but most importantly, we want to make sure that every American is able to benefit from that recovery; that we're not leaving anybody behind and everybody is getting a fair shot.","I was very pleased to see the House and the Senate agree to a budget and to put forward a bill that will fund our Government at levels that allow us to take some important steps to provide the services and the help that Americans need and American families need in order to get ahead in this economy. And so I would urge that Congress pass that funding measure as quickly as possible so that all these agencies have some certainty around their budgets.","And Congress is going to have some additional work over the course of the next several weeks; specifically, it's important that they do something about unemployment insurance. Although we've seen improvements in the economy and job creation in our economy, I think we all know that there are a lot of hard-working Americans out there who are desperately looking for a job, and unemployment insurance is not only good for them and necessary for them, but it's also good for our economy as a whole and will actually accelerate our growth if we go ahead and get that done. We know that we need to get immigration reform done, a major piece of unfinished business from last year.","So Congress is going to be busy, and I'm looking forward to working with Democrats and Republicans, House Members and Senate Members, to try to continue to advance the economic recovery and to provide additional ladders of opportunity for everybody. But one of the things that I'll be emphasizing in this meeting is the fact that we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help that they need. I've got a pen, and I've got a phone. And I can use that pen to sign Executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward in helping to make sure our kids are getting the best education possible and making sure that our businesses are getting the kind of support and help they need to grow and advance, to make sure that people are getting the skills that they need to get those jobs that our businesses are creating.","And I've got a phone that allows me to convene Americans from every walk of life— nonprofits, businesses, the private sector, universities—to try to bring more and more Americans together around what I think is a unifying theme: making sure that this is a country where if you work hard, you can make it.","And so one of the things that I'm going to be talking to my Cabinet about is, how do we use all the tools available to us, not just legislation, in order to advance a mission that I think unifies all Americans: the belief that everybody has got to take responsibility, everybody has got to work hard, but if you do, that you can support a family and meet the kinds of obligations that you have to yourself and your family, but also to your communities and to your Nation.","We're already seeing some examples of that. In fact, this week, I'll be traveling tomorrow down to North Carolina to talk about a manufacturing innovation hub that we initiated, talked about in our State of the Union last year. It's going to be moving forward. And there are a lot of folks down in North Carolina who are excited, because it's a perfect example of the kind of public-private partnership that can really make a difference in growing our economy faster and creating the kinds of good-paying jobs that help people get ahead.","I'll also be pulling together university presidents from all across the country to talk about how we can make college education more accessible to more young people around this country. And we're going to be bringing in CEOs from across the country to also have a conversation about commitments they can make to start hiring the long-term unemployed, people who oftentimes have terrific skills, have a great work ethic, have wonderful experience, but because of the misfortune of having been laid off or lost their jobs in the depths of a extremely severe recession, have been out of work long enough that now we're finding, it's very hard for them to just get in the door and make their case to an employer; that there's some screening that's taking place for people who have been out of work for more than a month or two and it makes it harder for them to get the kind of shot that they need. And we're going to try to work with CEOs to make a pledge that we're going to take a second look at these Americans who are very eager to get back to work and have the capacity to do so, but aren't getting the kind of shot that they need.","So overall, the message to my Cabinet—and that will be amplified in our State of the Union—is that we need all hands on deck to build on the recovery that we're already seeing. The economy is improving, but it could be improving even faster. A lot of people are doing better than they were in the depths of the recession, but there are still a lot of folks who need help. And I am absolutely confident that in 2014, if we're all working in the same direction and not worrying so much about political points, but worrying much more about getting the job done, that we can see a lot of improvement this year, and people will look back on 2014 as a year in which we didn't just turn the corner in the aggregate for the economy, but everybody started feeling a little more optimistic about our futures.","So I'm looking forward to the discussion.

Today, as part of an international coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab countries, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.","More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists. We're disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move. We're destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We're taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders.","In Iraq, local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed ISIL back. In Syria, ISIL failed in its major push to take the town of Kobani, losing countless fighters in the process, fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians. And we've seen reports of sinking morale among ISIL fighters as they realize the futility of their cause.","Now, make no mistake, this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It's going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose. Its barbaric murders of so many people, including American hostages, are a desperate and revolting attempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or its ideology, because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction. And with vile groups like this, there is only one option: With our allies and partners, we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.","And when I announced our strategy against ISIL in September, I said that we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. Today my administration submitted a draft resolution to Congress to authorize the use of force against ISIL. I want to be very clear about what it does and what it does not do.","This resolution reflects our core objective to destroy ISIL. It supports the comprehensive strategy that we've been pursuing with our allies and our partners: a systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria; support and training for local forces on the ground, including the moderate Syrian opposition; preventing ISIL attacks in the region and beyond, including by foreign terrorist fighters who try to threaten our countries; regional and international support for an inclusive Iraqi Government that unites the Iraqi people and strengthens Iraqi forces against ISIL; humanitarian assistance for the innocent civilians of Iraq and Syria, who are suffering so terribly under ISIL's reign of horror.","I want to thank Vice President Biden, Secretaries Kerry and Hagel, and General Marty Dempsey for their leadership in advancing our strategy. Even as we meet this challenge in Iraq and Syria, we all agree that one of our weapons against terrorists like ISIL—a critical part of our strategy—is the values we live here at home. One of the best antidotes to the hateful ideologies that try to recruit and radicalize people to violent extremism is our own example as diverse and tolerant societies that welcome the contributions of all people, including people of all faiths.","The resolution we've submitted today does not call for the deployment of U.S. ground combat forces to Iraq or Syria. It is not the authorization of another ground war, like Afghanistan or Iraq. The 2,600 American troops in Iraq today largely serve on bases, and yes, they face the risks that come with service in any dangerous environment. But they do not have a combat mission. They are focused on training Iraqi forces, including Kurdish forces.","As I've said before, I'm convinced that the United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East. That's not in our national security interest, and it's not necessary for us to defeat ISIL. Local forces on the ground who know their countries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to ISIL, and that's what they're doing.","At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unforeseen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn't have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our Special Forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven. So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate. And there is no heavier decision than asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives on our behalf. As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary for our national security.","Finally, this resolution repeals the 2002 authorization of force for the invasion of Iraq and limits this new authorization to 3 years. I do not believe America's interests are served by endless war or by remaining on a perpetual war footing. As a nation, we need to ask the difficult and necessary questions about when, why, and how we use military force. After all, it is our troops who bear the costs of our decisions, and we owe them a clear strategy and the support they need to get the job done. So this resolution will give our Armed Forces and our coalition the continuity we need for the next 3 years.","It is not a timetable. It is not announcing that the mission is completed at any given period. What it is saying is that Congress should revisit the issue at the beginning of the next President's term. It's conceivable that the mission is completed earlier. It's conceivable that after deliberation, debate, and evaluation, that there are additional tasks to be carried out in this area. And the people's representatives, with a new President, should be able to have that discussion.","In closing, I want to say that in crafting this resolution we have consulted with, and listened to, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. We have made a sincere effort to address difficult issues that we've discussed together. In the days and weeks ahead, we'll continue to work closely with leaders and Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. I believe this resolution can grow even stronger with the thoughtful and dignified debate that this moment demands. I'm optimistic that it can win strong bipartisan support and that we can show our troops and the world that Americans are united in this mission.","Now, today, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL, and we salute them for their courageous service. We pray for their safety. We stand with their families who miss them and who are sacrificing here at home. But know this: Our coalition is strong, our cause is just, and our mission will succeed. And long after the terrorists we face today are destroyed and forgotten, America will continue to stand free and tall and strong. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody.","NOTE: The President spoke at 3:37 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.","Barack Obama, Remarks on Proposed Legislation Submitted to the Congress To Authorize the Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksreceptionforsenatoredwardmkennedymcleanvirginia","text":["About Search"," ","Thank you so much. Senator and Mrs. Kennedy, the Kennedy family, Senator Mitchell and Members of the Senate, Congressmen, Congressman-to-be Patrick Kennedy, and Marvin Rosen, and all those who made this night possible, I thank you so much for your help for our friend. Chevy Chase, thank you for making us laugh.","I'll tell you a story about Chevy Chase. I never told this story in public before. Don't get that excited, it's not that good. I had never met Chevy Chase in my entire life, except on a movie screen. And in 1988 or '89, I went up to Long Island in the summertime. Hillary and I were up there visiting our friend Liz Robins, who's here tonight. And every summertime there's a softball game to raise money between the artists and the writers. And they asked me if I would be an umpire in this game. And once I realized there were some members of the press there and I'd be able to give them grades instead of the other way around, I eagerly accepted. Now, at that time a lot of you won't remember this; I hope, at least, you won't remember it, and I hope you'll forget after I tell you tonight. I had given a speech for Governor Dukakis at the Democratic Convention, which I intend to complete here this evening. Anyway I can't believe I said that. The announcer for the ball game was Jim Brady, the guy that does that \"Brady's Bits\" in Parade magazine every Sunday, you know? He's a delightful man, but when he saw me out there on the mound about ready to call balls and strikes, he saidhe introduced mehe said, \"This is Governor Clinton from Arkansas. He's up here visiting, and if he takes as long to make the calls today as he did to speak in Atlanta, we'll never get out of here.\" I really appreciated that. Anyway, so the game starts, and the next time the sides change, I look up in the stands, and this tall guy stands up and walks down, comes out to the pitcher's mound, shakes my hand, and says, \"I'm Chevy Chase.\" And he said, \"I may be the only person in America besides your mother who feels this way, but I liked that speech. Tell him to go to hell.\" That's verbatim what he said. [Applause] You just applauded for the next ambassador to Great Britain.","Ladies and gentlemen, you know we all do a lot of these events, and a lot of you are the backbone of our party. And sometimes we do them with great energy; sometimes we do them with interest; sometimes we do them because we know it's the right thing to do and we do them. I am here tonight because there is no place else in America I would rather be tonight than here in this cause for this good man.","You know, before I got here I really didn't understand how things so often came across in the country so different than they are up here. I was another alienated American, even though I was the Governor of my State. And I was terribly worried that this country was going in the wrong direction, that the people that were running our country were just telling the voters what they thought they wanted to hear and avoiding all the tough problemswe had had profound social problems building up for 30 years, we'd had serious economic problems building up for 20 yearsthat we had finally come to the end of the cold war, a time when we had an opportunity to take a fresh look at both the opportunities and the difficulties of this country at this time, and that we had a window here in which we could either secure the American dream for our children and our grandchildren and the strength of this country as we move into the 21st century, or we could walk away from the responsibilities of our generation.","When I talked to Hillary about running for President, Iin a very personal way, I didn't really want to do it. First of all, most of my friends thought it was a fool's errand because the incumbent President was at over 70 percent approval. Secondly, things were going pretty well for us at home, with our family, our friends, and our work. But I did it because I thought that we all have an obligation to try to make a difference and that we had to change the direction of the country.","Tonight we come here to honor someone who has always fought to keep us going forward in the right direction, who has always fought for hope over fear, for reconciliation over division, to bring out the best in us instead of to bring out the worst in us. Well, when I came here I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was determined to see that we work together to move this country forward, to address our problems, to get things done for ordinary Americans.","Well, it hasn't been easy. There have been some tough times and some really brutal fights. But you know, we've made a good start. And now, as always happens in these midterm elections, with the issue hanging fire, the American people will have to decide whether we will continue this rigorous transition into tomorrow.","Every time we reach a point in history where we're going through big changes and the future is not clear, we fight a battle within ourselves.","In that sense, our Nation is very much like a person. If you think about your own life, whenever you did anything really different and took on a new challenge, it was always with a mixture of hope and fear, when you went to school the first day or first went off to college or had your first job or first sought elective office or married or had your first child. No matter how good a thing is, if it is really big, it is also a little scary. Countries are the same way. A delicate balance always has to be maintained between hope and fear. And every day we all get up and we see things that are happening that we don't like or we're unsure what will happen to us. And it's almost as if we have a scale inside us, with blind justice holding it, and hope is on one side and fear is on the other. And each day it may take a little different balance.","The job we have between now and election day is to make sure that when people wake up on election day, they vote their hopes instead of their fears, they vote for tomorrow instead of yesterday, they vote to keep going forward, and they vote for Senator Ted Kennedy for reelection in Massachusetts.","We still have a lot to do, but we've made a good start. And we've done some very important things by putting our economic house in order, giving the American people their first serious attack on crime in a long time, and beginning to make this Government work for ordinary citizens.","If you look at the last 20 months, this CongressI might add, without one single, solitary vote from a member of the other partythe Democrats, who were so often attacked as being for big Government and spending, voted for a budget that cut $255 billion in Federal spending, that reduced the deficit by more than any plan ever adopted in the history of the country, that gave us 3 years of deficit reduction in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President. I might add, they did it by raising tax rates on only the top 1.2 percent of Americans, including most of you in this room tonight. And we thank you for staying with us.","This administrationand it's a great rebuke to those who think people only vote their own short-term self-interests; all of you are. And I honor you for your presence here tonight and for caring about your country and the long-term health and discipline and economic direction of what we're trying to do.","Our administration expanded trade by more than any in the comparable time period in the last 30 years. Exports are up, sales are up, and jobs are up in export-related areas. And what has all this produced: 4.3 million new jobs, 93 percent of them in the private sector, unlike the ratio in previous years when it's been mostly Government jobs created to try to help people deal with the problems of economic fallout. We've had 8 months of manufacturing job growth in a row for the first time in a decade. And just last week, at the annual vote of International Economists, for the first time in 9 years, it was the United States of America that was voted as having the most productive economy in the world. We've got a long way to go, but we've made a good beginning.","Senator Biden is here. And Senator Kennedy for years has been interested in this whole crime issue from his service on the Judiciary Committee. But Joe Biden will tell you they talked about crime around here for 6 years, but we finally passed the crime bill that is tough with punishment, tough in terms of putting 100,000 police on the street, but also smart in providing prevention and giving people a chance to turn away from lives of crime and giving our young people a chance to have something to say yes to. Also, for the first time in my memory we put together back-to-back victories with the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban, in spite of the ferocious opposition of the NRA. That's a pretty good beginning. We've got a long way to go, but it's a pretty good beginning.","If you look at what was done to make Government work for ordinary people, in the economic plan, we reformed the college loan program the Secretary of Education is here tonight making 20 million Americans, including over 840,000 in the State of Massachusetts, eligible for low-interest loans at longer repayment terms, a stunning benefit for middle class kids, not just poor kids, so that no one need ever walk away from the challenge of paying for a college education againyou can clap for that; Ted Kennedy was for it. [Applause] We have 200,000 more children in Head Start; hundreds of thousands of people in Massachusetts alone affected by the family leave law which says that if you've got a sick parent or you're about to have a child, you can take a little time off work without losing your job. We are going to have 2 million more children immunized by 1996, so that all the kids under 2 will be immunized and parents can go to work not worrying about whether their children are going to be safe from preventable childhood diseases. Fifteen million working people and their children are going to get income tax cuts because they work hard and they raise their kids but they're hovering just above the poverty line, and we do not want them to fall into the poverty line and quit working and go on welfare. This is a pro-work, pro-family administration making this Government work for ordinary citizens again. And it's a good start.","Finally, let me say to our friends in the other party, I sat out there in the heartland of America as the Governor for years and years and years, and I heard them talk about how terrible the Federal Government was and how big and bloated it was. But we, the Democrats, voted to reduce the size of the Federal Government by 272,000, to make it the smallest it's been since President Kennedy was in office. We have already done over 70,000 of those reductions. And every last red cent of reduction in the Federal Government is going to local government and to local communities to help them fight crime. That is the record of the Democrats in the last 2 years.","Now, if you compare that to what our opponents have done and what they have said, it's a pretty big difference. In the name of partisanship, they tried to stop the crime bill. They voted entirely against the economic program, a program that gave college loan breaks to millions of kids, a program that made 90 percent of the small businesses in this country eligible for tax cuts and gave tax reductions to 15 million working families. They have done everything they could to keep us from addressing the health care reform issue in a serious way. You needn't take my word for it, only listen to them: Congressman Grandy from Iowa saying that they had all been ordered not to cooperate and compromise on health care; a Republican Senator quoted in one of our big newspapers the other day saying, \"We killed health care, now if we can just not get our fingerprints on it\"; their political adviser, Mr. Kristol, telling them the one thing they must not do is to cooperate to bring down health care costs, make health insurance secure for those who have it, and cover those who don't because that would be a political benefit for the other party. That is their record.","Now we know what they wish to do if they get the majority. They put out their Contract With America, and you know what they did? It looks like a contract; it looks like they took out a contract against the deficit, a contract against Medicare, a contract against paying for the crime bill, a contract against all the gains we have made for ordinary Americans in the last 2 years. They want to go back to the way they did it before, explode the deficit, tell people what they want to hear, and stick it to ordinary Americans. We can do better than that. We have to go forward. We have to reelect the people and elect the people who want to keep going forward.","If you just look at the things that Senator Kennedy has been involved in just since I have been Presidentthe Head Start program, 200,000 more children; reforming the education loans; working on changing the whole unemployment system to a reemployment system, something we haven't finished yet; the Goals 2000 bill, which for the first time in the history of America commits us as a nation to world-class standards of educational excellence and commits the Federal Government not to have a bureaucracy but to give help to local grassroots efforts at reform; the national service program, which this year has 20,000 young Americans and 2 years from now will have 100,000 young Americans earning their way to a higher education by serving their communities at the grassroots level, not in a bureaucracy but in people power that can truly change the course of our country's futurehe led the way in all of those endeavors. And he deserves a lot of credit for it.","But elections are about the future. If we do a good job, it's just what we were hired to do. So why should he be reelected? Because if you ever want this country to be able to bring the deficit down without breaking the backs of our senior citizens; if you ever want to see a time when working people will be secure in their insurance, instead of the situation which exists todaythis is the only advanced country in the world where working families are losing ground in insurance coverage. There are 5 million Americans in working families today who had health insurance 5 years ago who do not have it today, even though we spend 40 percent more of our income than any other country on health care. If you want to preserve the integrity of our great medical institutions of higher learning, if you want to see health insurance for all Americans and stability in our economy long-term and in our Federal budget long-term, we have got to address the health care issue.","So what if we couldn't do it in a year. Look what's happened since I've been here. It took 7 years to pass the Brady bill, 7 years to pass family leave, 7 years to pass motor voter, 6 years to pass the crime bill. I signed a banking reform bill today that they've been working on longer than anybody can remember. We can do this. We will do this. The people of Massachusetts, I don't believe, want to send a signal to Washington, DC, that they have abandoned health care. I think they want to tell us to keep at it until we get it right. And the only way to do that is to say, \"Senator Kennedy, stay on the job; keep doing it until we get it right.\"","My friends, you will see this election everywhere in America played out. Look at Patrick Kennedy's race in Rhode Island. He's running against someone who signed the contract, a contract against health care reform, for cutting Medicare, for exploding the deficit, for putting the Federal budget in a place where they won't even be able to fund the crime billthe same old promises, tell them what they want to hear, bad-mouth Government, bad-mouth the people who are the instruments of change, and hope you don't get caught. I think the American people are smarter than that.","You know, Ted Kennedy said tonight that he was not the youngest man in the Senate race. He was once the youngest man in the Senate for quite a long time. Well, I was once the youngest Governor in America by 9 years. Time has a way of curing those problemsand of changing your perspective. But I would like to say something about Senator Kennedy and about the United States. He's made enemies in his life because he has fought for things. But the things he has fought for are things that would help people who are very different from him. Ninety-five percent of the people that would have been given the things that he was given in life never would have spent their life trying to get all that for everybody else in the country. Most of us, given the opportunities he had, would have enjoyed them in a very different way. They wouldn't have put themselves on the line day in and day out, year in and year out.","This country is also very old as a democracy, but it is forever young. When people say they worry about whether we've still got it as a country, I say to them: Why do you think the Israelis and the Arabs want to come here and have us work with them to end the decades of horrible fighting in the Middle East? Why do you think that after literally hundreds of years of fighting, the Catholics and the Protestants in Northern Ireland, and the British and the Irish wish the Americans to be involved in the peace process? Why did Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk want the United States to spend a few million dollars of our tax money to help them develop an election that would really work? Even in the 11th hour of our crisis in Haiti a little over a week ago, when the delegation was down there meeting with the military leaders and they realized finally that we meant business, one of them said, \"Well, if the President is determined to do this and the United Nations is determined to act, at least we want the United States here; we trust them, we know they can be trusted. We know what they represent.\" Why? Because the right things, my fellow Americans, never get old.","And I was sitting here looking at Ted Kennedy give that speech tonight, and I saw it literally moving his entire being. And I said to myself, let the people who disagree with him disagree. Let the people who say he's wrong on the issues say that. But let no one doubt that he may be the youngest person running for the Senate in any State this year, because he believes in things that are forever young.","Thank you, and God bless you all."]}

And he asked me to come out to a site. They took me up on an elevator outside. There was four of them, crazy sons of guns like you all, sitting and having their lunch on a beam, I guess, about 12 stories above the ground.","You're nuts. [Laughter] And thank God you are. I tell you what: You've got to not only have some brains, but you got to be coordinated to be an ironworker, man.","And I was told that—they said, you know, they've done a cutout of number 46, the Vice—the Presidency. I'm the 46th [SPEAKER]. And I'm thinking, \"Well, maybe I can take it home.\" [Laughter] That's solid steel, man. [Laughter] And you guys did that on your time. Well, thank you very much. I'm not going to try and take it home. [Laughter]","But look, folks, it really is: It's an honor to be here, for real. And I want to thank your soon-to-be new, full-blown, full-bore ironworker. Marty is already trying to get her to Boston, but that's another thing I got to warn you about. [Laughter]","But, folks, look, it's an honor to be here with Vice President Harris and with the Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, a proud member and former president of the Laborers' Local Union 222—223 up in Boston. And our Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, has got a few things we're going to build.","And I want to thank the Maryland delegation: Ben Cardin, who's been a friend for a long time; and Chris Van Hollen, who's a really close friend; and an outstanding Congressman, Anthony Brown, and other elected officials that are here. Look, all of whom fight for working people, in Maryland and in every—and every other State. Because if it happens here, it happens around the world—happens around the country.","It's been an honor to be with the ironworkers of Local 5. And we talk about building a future that's made in America. We're talking about you. And this time we're going to get it really correct.","You know, one of the press persons said to me—and I can't remember who—about 3 months ago, that—I don't know if it's factual or not, but he said, \"You've used the word 'union' as President more than any other President in American history.\" So let me tell you: I'm not sure that it's true.","Participant. It's true!","[SPEAKER]. But I tell you what: I promised you you'd have a union President. And I am, because you're the best.","You know, we talk about whether Wall Street built America. There are good folks on Wall Street; they're not bad folks. There are good people all over the country. I tell you who built America: the middle class. And the people who built the middle class are organized labor—unions, unions. Unions did it. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact. That's a straight fact.","And the Executive order I'm going to sign today is going to help ensure that we build a better America, we build it right and we build it on time and we build it cheaper than it would have been otherwise.","You know, the Executive order is making sure that Federal construction projects get completed on time and under budget, saving taxpayers money, clearing construction zones quickly, and ensuring that everything the Federal Government signs to contract to build is built to last. You guys really, genuinely, are the best in the world. Not—that's not hyperbole. It's a fact.","To do that, we're using a tool that ironworkers here know very well, called \"project labor agreements.\" I know you all know it, but folks who may be watching this may not fully understand it.","Simply put, these are agreements that contractors, subcontractors, and unions put in place before a construction site gets underway, before the construction begins. They ensure that major projects are handled by well-trained, well-prepared, highly skilled workers, and they ward off problems. They resolve disputes ahead of time, ensuring safer work sites, avoiding disruptions and work stoppages that can cause expensive delays down the line.","And that makes a big difference for the American taxpayer. Because when big construction projects are completed efficiently and with the highest degree of professionalism, it's good for the American taxpayer. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact. We don't talk about it though. We don't talk about how you all save the American taxpayers money.","It's good for families who live in those communities. All across the country, the Federal construction projects are being built as I speak. And it means that modernization of your local waterways will get done sooner, won't cost twice as much as expected. And when the next storm comes, the power will more likely stay on and homes and businesses will be better protected from flooding.","It means new air traffic control towers at the local airports will be up and running more quickly, so flights are safer at the airports and more efficient. It means new housing will be built on our military bases; will be of the highest quality, which these servicemembers deserve. It will hold up better and make life easier for our military families.","The Executive order I'm going to sign will help defuse problems before they arise. They're going to improve coordination between contractors, subcontractors, and workers on the job site. It's going to help guarantee a consistent supply of high-quality, highly trained workers.","You know, what people don't understand if they're not—don't know the industry is, you know, it's like you going to college, kid. Four years. Four years of busting your neck, learning a trade. This isn't something you walk up and show up in a day and raise your hand, \"I need a job.\" You work like the devil for it. Fortunately, you get paid while you're doing it, and you're able to do it, but it is an education—full-blown education you're getting in your trade.","Well, you'll have a voice on the work site, full commitment to getting the job done. And it's going to raise the bar on quality for some of those vital projects we're going to be building. And we're going to make sure that Federal construction projects are staffed with good-paying union jobs.","One of you actually came up to me today and said, \"Joe, you said you're going to do that, and you're doing it.\" Well, when President Obama asked me to run the Recovery Act, I made sure every single job I could get was a union job, prevailing wage. Because I've noticed when folks are getting paid a decent wage, everybody in the community does better, everything looks better.","They're jobs you can raise a family on. Or as my dad would say, \"They're jobs you can put your head on the pillow at night and just have a little breathing room\"—a little security, a little breathing room. Jobs that can't be outsourced. And that's good for nearly 200,000 workers on Federal construction contracts right now. It's good for everybody.","I don't want to get going because I'll keep you here too long, because you know all of what I'm about to—what I've said, and you know what I've done, and you know what we're doing, and you know what—I know what you're doing.","But let me close with this: A week ago, I went to Pittsburgh to tour a former steel mill that's now a cutting-edge manufacturing research and development hub. Right before I left to the trip, I got word that a bridge collapsed. You saw it on television. It looked as bad in person as it did at the time. The bridge had been rated in poor condition, like, I might add, over 3,000 bridges in Pennsylvania, 45,000 across the Nation. It had been rated that way for the last 10 years.","When I got there, folks told me something close to a miracle had occurred. Because of a snowstorm that morning, school openings were late and commutes were delayed. So when that bridge collapsed—and it was well over a hundred feet off the—two—almost two—I don't—I didn't—I don't know the exact, but probably from down to the creek that it went over and the ravine, probably a couple hundred feet.","When it collapsed, instead of a bus with a couple people on it—being packed with school buses full of children, the people on their way to work on the bridge that is one of the busiest bridges—you know, there are more bridges in Pittsburgh than any other city in the world; with the three rivers—the bridge was empty, relatively empty. Fortunately, no one was killed, but for a snowstorm.","Just imagine the challenges we face and the opportunities to build a better America, and extend it far beyond roads and bridges now that we can—know we have to do. We passed that infrastructure bill. But it's not just that.","Across the country right now there are countless buildings, ports, airports, power stations, and other Federal construction projects that need to be modernized and built for the future. We can't count on miracles, like happened in—out in Pittsburgh, to prevent tragedies that are waiting in plain sight.","But what we can count on, what America has always counted on: the American worker, the hardest working, best trained workers in the world; American workers who, given just half a chance, have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down, and gotten the job done.","And that's what this day is all about, in my view: getting the job done for the American taxpayers, getting the job done right the first time.","You know, folks, there's a law that's existed for a long time that has too many exceptions like this one had, and that is that—buy American.","As [SPEAKER] of the United States, I award contracts. And I'm now making it the case—and it's working; it's one of the reasons those jobs were up—is unless the product that I'm purchasing for the American people was made in America and all of its component parts are made in America, we ain't buying it. We're just simply not buying it.","And what's going to happen here—not a joke; it's a fact. It's not a violation of any international laws either. What we're talking about here, with three exceptions I won't bore you with—and they're highly unusual—but with three exceptions: Every single project that we're talking about that's paid for with Federal dollars and is a Federal project, it's going to be union jobs, every single one of them.","The last time we tried it, there were so many exceptions, I think only 19, 20 jobs—[inaudible]. There are going to be thousands, thousands of people put to work. Not a joke. I mean, this is serious.","And guess what? The American public's going to be safer, and it's going to be cheaper—cheaper paying the right wage and the right trained people to begin with and get the job done right and on time.","So I'm about to walk over and sign an Executive order that's going to make that happen. And we're going to start once that order is signed.","Just remember: It ain't labor, it's unions. Thank you.","Now, usually you have a pen to give out to everybody around you, but we didn't have enough pens to bring with us. So I'm going to sign this order, but you're all going to get one of the signing pens, starting with the Maryland delegation. [Laughter]","[At this point, [SPEAKER] signed the Executive order.]","There you go.","Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningintolawthefoodandagricultureact1977","text":["About Search"," ","[SPEAKER]. I think all of you can see before me the results of a tremendous amount of work and cooperation among all those in our Government who are interested in the present and future strength of our Nation's number one economic resource, and that's agriculture.","I think it's also accurate to point out that more than has ever been the case in the past, that professional nutritionists and their representatives, private citizens, consumer groups, have been involved in the preparation of this legislation.","Another fact that I think would be undisputed is that in the last 40 years, there has never been such a far-reaching and important piece of legislation passed relating to American agriculture. There's been a heavy emphasis in this bill on the strength of the American farm family. This is an important concept for us all.","We are very eager to continue our preeminent position in international agricultural trade circles. Public Law 480, which permits us to dispose of American food products in a beneficial way, is enhanced. Foreign trade with the sale of our own agricultural commodities is enhanced.","We have in this bill, too, a new approach to the food stamp question. This has sometimes been considered as an anomaly or an anachronism in a modern day Department of Agriculture. But I think this legislation that has been included in the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 is a great step forward in providing a simple food stamp system and one that would be easy to administer, one that is more equitable, which eliminates the pervasive threat of fraud.","I'd also like to point out that this bill includes many other features--a renewed emphasis and an enhancement of our research program in agriculture that's so important to every family.","It, for the first time, makes a major step toward tying target prices to actual production costs. This has been one of the most controversial issues that the Congress has had to face. Obviously, because production costs vary so widely from one community to another, and a bill of this kind has to deal with average prices or cost of production throughout the country, there still remain and will inevitably remain some inequities.","But this bill makes a giant step toward tying target prices with production costs, and it also narrows its focus on individual commodities so that there can be more equity insured.","This bill also sets up a means for maintaining adequate food reserves. Although we have been blessed recently with bountiful crops, we don't have an excessive reserve supply of crucial food and feed items on hand. This bill permits us to maintain adequate reserves, and it also encompasses a provision that's very dear to me, and that is that most of the reserves will be under the control of farmers and that there's a very careful safeguard against the dumping of agricultural products on the market, artificially, to force prices down and, therefore, to damage the economy of farm families.","We have moved in this bill to correct a very serious economic problem that exists among the farm communities of our Nation by increasing target and loan prices for the 1977 crop. And I believe that this will certainly be a good investment both this year and in the future.","Another aspect of this bill that particularly ,appeals to me is the reduction of Government interference in the agricultural economy. This is always devoutly to be sought, and I think the Congress has very wisely achieved this goal in this current legislation.","We've eliminated acreage allotments. Quite often in the past, acreage allotments historically have evolved into a financial measure of the benefit of Government programs, and they are bought and traded like actual property. This bill moves to eliminate those acreage allotments.","We've also maintained an important element in the set-aside authority for the Agriculture Secretary. And very shortly now, set-aside regulations will be promulgated by this Department.","I have to admit that the bill is about $300 million more costly than I had personally preferred to see. But I think the investment is a good one. And I think the cost of this bill, because of its wise drafting, will be less and less as the future years go by.","We have an exceptional case at the present time in agriculture, where additional expenditures are required. One of the elements of agricultural legislation and appropriations which is often overlooked is that at least half the costs that are normally attributed to an agricultural bill are actually in the form of redeemable loans. And this is not an expenditure from the Federal Government; it's an investment in a very good and sound commodity. The loan is secured and the loans are repaid, but under our present accounting system, this is identified as an expenditure, and it tends to distort in the public mind the degree of Federal investment in agriculture.","I'd like to close by saying that I'm very proud of the good work that has been done this year, and in years gone by, by Senator Talmadge, the chairman of the Senate committee and, of course, by Tom Foley and Bob Poage and all those Democrats and Republicans who've worked with them, both within the committee and on the floor of Congress.","These have been tedious studies and negotiations. Bob Bergland and his staff in the Department of Agriculture have worked very harmoniously with the congressional leaders. And as [SPEAKER] of our country, as a farmer myself, as someone who feels a direct responsibility to the consumers of this country, I'm very proud now to affix my signature onto the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 and ratify into law one of the most progressive and far-reaching pieces of legislation that has come before me.","Thank you very much, all of you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthebilldesignatingthecentennialyearlibertytheunitedstates","text":["Three very nice young people. I will speak about them in a few moments. Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, honored guests, and ladies and gentlemen, on this date in 1886, President Grover Cleveland stood on an island in New York Harbor to dedicate a statue entitled \"Liberty Enlightening the World.\" Ninety-nine years later, the statue is known by a more familiar affectionate name, the Statue of Liberty or simply Miss Liberty. She's cherished across America, and the torch that she bears is recognized throughout the world as a symbol of human freedom.","The Statue of Liberty was conceived and created by the French sculptor Frederic Bartholdi. Legend has it that as he worked, he modeled the statue's face—that face of utter calm and nobility—on the features of his own mother. Completed, the statue rose more than 150 feet and was constructed of 200,000 pounds of hand-hammered copper sheathing hung on an iron frame engineered by Gustav Eiffel, who later designed the Eiffel Tower. On July 4th, 1884, the statue was presented to the American Ambassador to France. Built using funds donated by the French people, she was then dismantled and shipped to the United States. Then, she was rebuilt using funds donated by the American people, including money raised by schoolchildren. Ever since, she's stood on her island in that great harbor lighting the way to freedom.","Just a few hundred yards away, there's a second island, Ellis Island. Between 1892 and 1954, nearly 17 million immigrants to the New World passed through the Ellis Island checkpoint. Most immigrants moved through the checkpoint in a few hours to begin their new lives in America and freedom. And I like to picture the scene as a boatload of immigrants leaving Ellis Island for New York, they pass Miss Liberty and crowd the rails to gaze. Someone on board knows English, he reads and translates the inscription that the statue bears, words that have proclaimed the meaning of America for millions of immigrants, for shiploads of returning soldiers in two great wars, for every family that has ever visited that glorious statue. And those words: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost, to me. I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door.\" Well, many of those immigrants remain at the rails until Miss Liberty is lost in the fog. It would be no surprise if some shed tears of joy.","In recent years, it became all too apparent that Ellis Island and Miss Liberty, herself, were being ravaged by the passing of decades. Nearly half of all Americans can trace their ancestry to someone who passed through the Ellis Island checkpoint. But that island, which should be a proud memorial to our forbearers, had instead become a sad and ramshackled place. Miss Liberty, for her part, had been badly corroded by decades of salt air; her iron supports had weakened; in places, she'd become pocked with jagged, rusty holes.","Well, then, in 1982 the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation was formed to restore Miss Liberty and rebuild Ellis Island, and to do so with private funds. This effort has become one of the largest private sector initiatives in American history. Across America, everyone is lending a hand; major corporations are making contributions; small businesses are helping out. And I'm pleased to say that just as schoolchildren helped raise the money to build her pedestal and install Miss Liberty back in the 1880's, today, a century later, they're holding bake sales and car washes to see to it that she gets the restoration she needs.","Let me give you just three of many stirring examples. Michael Haverly, of Indianapolis, Indiana, has raised over $5,000 for the statue by going door to door with an appeal to help Miss Liberty. Well, I'm proud to be in Michael's company here in the Rose Garden today. And then, there is Amy Nessler, of West Deptford Township, New Jersey, who brought a jar of 365 pennies into her first-grade class to help raise money for the Statue of Liberty. The pennies had been collected 15 years earlier by Amy's mother, who, day by day, put one into a jar to mark the time that her fiancé was in Vietnam. And now, after all these years, they felt it was only appropriate to give these special coins to Lady Liberty, who symbolizes what Amy's dad fought for freedom. Well, I'm very happy that Amy, her mother, and father are here with us today. And finally, there is Donna Daley, a 13-year-old from Ridgeland, South Carolina. When Donna's hometown learned that she was losing her sight to an incurable eye disease, they pitched in to raise money to send her and her family to visit the Statue of Liberty. However, Donna, in the spirit of generosity, donated part of this contribution to the Liberty Restoration Project. And, Donna, you're a fine example to us all.","So far, this private sector initiative has raised more than $170 million, well on its way to its goal of 230 million. Today Miss Liberty and Ellis Island are surrounded by scaffolding; workers are on the sites 24 hours a day. Among countless other repairs, they're giving the statue new iron supports and fitting her pedestal with the tallest hydraulic elevator in America. On Ellis Island, they're giving the main building a new roof, replacing the copper towers, and completely restoring the interiors. Much has been accomplished, but there's still a great deal to be done in order to reopen Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty by the only appropriate date—the Fourth of July, 1986.","And mindful of this need, the Congress has passed a resolution which it is my honor to sign today. The resolution reads in part: \"Whereas, the nation will celebrate the Statue of Liberty's 100th anniversary through commemorative events scheduled to take place during the Fourth of July weekend in 1986, and on October 28, 1986; now therefore be it resolved—that the 12-month period ending on October 28, 1986, is designated as the centennial year of liberty...\"","Well, I'm looking forward to attending the Liberty Weekend celebration next July and the hundredth anniversary a year from today. David Wolper, who is producing the Liberty Weekend activities, has promised to outdo himself, which won't be easy, after seeing the superb job he did with the 1976 bicentennial and the 1984 Olympics. And Ambassador Mosbacher has planned quite a display himself with the tall ships of Operation Sail.","Throughout this Centennial Year of Liberty, let us join in the great work of restoring the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, perhaps our nation's most moving and powerful symbols of freedom. And drawing inspiration from these symbols, let us rededicate ourselves to the great cause of human liberty throughout the world.","I thank you, and God bless you. And now I'm going to sign that resolution."]}

Welcome to the people's house as we celebrate a victory for the American economy. Last week, the United States Congress passed trade promotion authority and renewed and expanded the Andean Trade Preference Act. Trade is an important source of good jobs for our workers and a source of higher growth for our economy. Trade is an important source of earnings for our farmers and for our factories. It creates new opportunities for our entrepreneurs. Trade expands choices for America's consumers and raises living standards for our families. And now, after 8 years, America is back in the business of promoting open trade to build our prosperity and to spur economic growth.","I appreciate so very much Vice President Cheney's hard work on this issue. I appreciate Colin Powell and Ann Veneman, who ably serve in my Cabinet. I want to particularly thank Don Evans, who's not with us, and Bob Zoellick, members of my Cabinet who both worked tirelessly to get the vote in the House and then in the Senate, and I appreciate Elaine Chao as well. These Cabinet Secretaries worked hard for trade. They understand the promise of trade, and I appreciate their hard work on behalf of American workers and farmers.","I particularly want to thank the Members of Congress who are here with us, starting with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator from Montana, Max Baucus. Max did fantastic work to get this trade bill through the Senate and was then able to work with Chairman Thomas. [Laughter] Chairman Thomas was heroic in the House. He was steadfast in his support for trade, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue. And I want to thank both Members of the United States Congress, one Democrat, one Republican, who put their country ahead of their parties to do what was right for the people of this country. You two deserve a lot of congratulations. I want to thank Senator Hatch, who was a conferee and a member of the Finance Committee. Thanks for coming, Senator. I want to thank my fellow Texan Tom DeLay, the best vote-counter in the history of the United States Congress. [Laughter] After all, he was able to triple—[laughter]—the vote margin on final passage. I appreciate so very much Cal Dooley and a guy I call \"Jeff,\" William Jefferson, Congressmen from California and Louisiana, and I want to thank them for their work as well. They led the Democrats in the House of Representatives, many of whom are here today, to do what's right for our country. And again, I appreciate your leadership, and I appreciate your work, and I appreciate your help.","I want to thank Embajadora A-Baki from Ecuador. I want to thank you for coming. I also want to thank Carlos Alzamora from Peru and all the other ambassadors who are here. I want to appreciate you—appreciate your hard work on sending the message of trade to Members of our Congress. I want to thank you for your diligence, and I want to thank your [SPEAKER]s for their care and concern about this incredibly important initiative, not only for Americans but for workers all around the world. Thank you all for coming.","With trade promotion authority, the trade agreements I negotiate will have an up-or-down vote in Congress, giving other countries the confidence to negotiate with us. Five Presidents before me had this advantage, but since the authority elapsed in 1994, other nations and regions have pursued new trade agreements while America's trade policy was stuck in park. With each passing day, America has lost trading opportunities and the jobs and earnings that go with them. Starting now, America is back at the bargaining table in full force.","I will use trade promotion authority aggressively to create more good jobs for American workers, more exports for American farmers, and higher living standards for American families. Free trade has a proven track record for spurring growth and advancing opportunity for our working families. Exports accounted for roughly one-quarter of all U.S. economic growth in the 1990s. Jobs in exporting plants pay wages that are up to 18 percent higher than jobs in nonexporting plants. And our two major trade agreements, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, have created more choices and lower prices for consumers while raising standards of living for the typical American family of four by $2,000 a year.","America will build on this record of success. A completely free global market for agricultural products, for example, would result in gains of as much as $13 billion a year for American farmers and consumers. Lowering global trade barriers on all products and services by even one-third could boost the U.S. economy by $177 billion a year and raise living standards for the average family by $2,500 annually. In other words, trade is good for the American people, and I'm going to use the trade promotion authority to bring these benefits to the American people.","Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global prosperity and adding to the momentum of political freedom. Trade is an engine of economic growth. It uses the power of markets to meet the needs of the poor. In our lifetime, trade has helped lift millions of people and whole nations and entire regions out of poverty and put them on the path to prosperity. History shows that as nations become more prosperous, their citizens will demand and then can—and can afford a cleaner environment. And greater freedom for commerce across the borders eventually leads to greater freedom for citizens within the borders.","The members of the diplomatic corps with us today understand the importance of free trade to their nations' success. They understand that trade is an enemy of poverty and a friend of liberty. I want to thank the ambassadors for their role in getting this bill passed, especially the Andean ambassadors, who are such strong advocates for the Andean Trade Preference Act. By providing trade preference for products from four Andean democracies, we will build prosperity, reduce poverty, strengthen democracy, and fight illegal drugs with expanding economic opportunity.","Trade promotion authority gives the United States an important tool to break down trade barriers with all countries. We'll move quickly to build free trade relationships with individual nations, such as Chile and Singapore and Morocco. We'll explore free trade relationships with others, such as Australia. The United States will negotiate a Free Trade Area of the Americas and pursue regional agreements with the nations of Central America and the Southern African Customs Union. We'll move forward globally, working with all nations to make the negotiations begun last year in Doha a success. A little more than a week ago, the United States put forward a far-reaching proposal to lower worldwide agricultural trade barriers. These innovative set of ideas can lead to real progress in this challenging area.","Trade gives all nations the hope of sharing in the great economic and social and political progress of our age. And trade will give American workers the hope that comes from better and higher paying jobs. America's committed to building a world that trades in freedom and grows in prosperity and liberty. Today we have the tools to pursue that vision, and I look forward to the work ahead.","And now it's my honor and pleasure to sign into law the Trade Act of 2002."]}

Sometimes you can't join us, but for the most part, we've been very good about it, and I just urge your strong support for this veto strategy.

Thank you, Secretary Shalala, Acting Secretary Metzler. Thank you both for the work you've done on this. I thank the Commission members for their willingness to serve, those who are here and a few who could not be here with us today. And I thank all of you here in this audience for your interest in this profoundly important matter.","The Advisory Commission that I announced today will help to chart our way through a time of profound change in health care. Their task will be focused and urgent: to find ways to ensure quality and to ensure that the rights of consumers in health care are protected.","Since I took office, we have been committed to improving our health care system, to making it more affordable, more accessible, while preserving its high quality. You have heard Secretary Shalala mention some of the things we have done together. We've worked with States to expand Medicaid to more than 2 million Americans who previously had no insurance. We reached across party lines to enact the Kassebaum-Kennedy law that provides that working families will not lose their insurance when they change jobs, increased the health care tax deduction for 3 million self-employed Americans. And now in our budget plan, we have funds sufficiently targeted to extend coverage to as many as half of our 10 million American children who still don't have medical coverage.","We've worked to constrain costs. Just yesterday, I announced a new effort to combat the multibillion dollar problem of fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. Our balanced budget proposal also strengthens Medicare through savings and overdue structural reforms.","Of course, we're not alone in this. The private sector has found ways to rein in costs, sometimes dramatically. And in many cases, changes in the health care delivery system have, frankly, also improved its quality. For example, the growing recognition of the value of preventive care, such as mammography screening, is saving and extending lives and the quality of life. This is all very encouraging. Step by step we have been working to expand access to health care, and today we take the next step.","In this time of transition, many Americans worry that lower costs mean lower quality and less attention to their rights. On balance, however, managed health care plans, HMO's, PPO's, and others, give patients good care and greater choice at lower cost. Still, we must make sure that these changes do not keep health professionals from offering the best and the most medically appropriate services to their patients. Managed care managed well can be the best deal for our families. Whether they have traditional health care or managed care, none of our people should ever have inferior care.","I am proud that the Medicare and Medicaid programs have taken the lead in responding to the quality concerns of both patients and health care providers, as Secretary Shalala has just described. But we're learning the defining, measuring, and enforcing quality is far from a simple task. There are many complicated issues. They require thoughtful study. And not surprisingly, there are many areas where broad-based consensus on how best to proceed does not yet exist.","That is why I decided late last year to establish the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry. Today I am happy to introduce the members of that Commission to the American people. They are a highly distinguished, broad-based, and diverse group. They represent consumers, business, labor, health care providers, insurers, managed care plans, State and local governments, health care quality experts. Their specialties are wide-ranging, including care for children, the elderly, women, people with disabilities, mental illness, or AIDS. This Commission includes some of the best health care policy minds in our Nation and a lot of people with hands-on experience. Its task will be as challenging as it is critical.","Today, to assure that they get busy right away, I am charging the Commission to develop a consumer bill of rights so that health care patients get the information and care they need when they need it. Let's assure that patients and their families—first, that the health care professionals who are treating them are free to provide the best medical advice available; second, that their providers are not subject to inappropriate financial incentives to limit care; third, that our sickest and most vulnerable patients, frequently the elderly and people with disabilities, are receiving the best medical care for their unique needs; fourth, that consumers have access to simple and fair procedures for resolving health care coverage disputes with plans; fifth, and perhaps most important, that consumers have basic information about their rights and responsibilities, about the plans—the benefits the plans offer, about how to access the health care they need, and about the quality of their providers and their health care plans.","I'm delighted that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor will take on the task of being the Commission's Cochairs. I look forward to reviewing their first report at the end of the year and their final report next March.","The need for this Commission is real. It is urgent. It will give us a roadmap to help us make our way through the time of rapid change we now see in our health care system. There are few people in the Nation better suited to the task than the members of this Commission. And again, let me say, I want to thank them for their commitment to serve.","And to all the rest of you let me say, one of the things, one of the many things I have learned in the last 4 years as [SPEAKER] is that a distinguished commission, broadly based with a clear mandate, can make a profound positive difference for our country. In the health care related areas, I ask you to think of only two. Think of the work done by the Gulf War Commission and what we now know that we did not know when they started to meet and work. Think of the remarkable work done by the Commission that dealt with those who were exposed to human radiation experiments just a few decades ago here and the work that they have done. There is a peculiar way in which the citizens of the United States, when brought together around a clear mandate, interfacing with their Government and with the private sector, can do more than either the Government or the private sector could do alone.","And so again, let me say, I'm very hopeful about this Commission. I look forward to their progress on the consumer's bill of rights. I look forward to all the work that they do. And I ask you to join me in thanking them for their willingness to serve.","Thank you very much."]}

But I must say that the great pleasure of meeting with a group of people that you know to be friendly, who wish well to you and to the cause for which you struggle, is a very warm feeling.","And this inspires me to tell you a little bit of what we are trying to do, how truly simple it is, and therefore, to see whether we may not draw even a little closer together because of the simplicity of these ideas and, I think, the fact that we see all right-thinking Americans should be for, in general this kind of thing.","Carter Glass once went to a great university. He was to receive an honorary degree of doctor of laws; and the dean of the law school, in presenting him to the president of the university, read a long citation. This citation had to deal largely, almost exclusively, with the long record of Carter Glass's integrity, his absolute unimpeachable honesty as a public servant throughout his life. It dwelt on this theme in numerous ways and I think even quoted examples.","Finally it was Carter Glass's turn to speak. He said: \"My friends, I think I should decline to receive this decoration, because if the time has come when the American people and their great institutions of learning find it proper or necessary or desirable to decorate a man and give him awards because he is honest in the public service, then I despair of the Republic.\"","\"This,\" he said, \"is something you can demand of your public servants; you don't .have to reward them for it. You can demand it through the proper use of your authority as an American citizen, through the ballot box, and you can see that you get good men--honest men and women in government. ' '","Now there is a particular reason why this is so important. We are very apt, when we speak about government in Washington, to think of some rather amorphous, distant, bewildering, comprehensive, complex thing. We don't really know what we mean when we say government. We realize there is a President up there, and a few leaders in the Senate and the House, and we sort of have them visualized; and the rest of it is just a bunch of bureaucrats.","And that's largely true.","But what I want to get over is this: government is nothing in the world but men and women that you select and send to fill the several offices.","Now of course, there is an organization roughly outlined by a Constitution, and more crystallized through our laws as the decades have gone on. But the only thing that comprises government is men and women.","Now those men and women, therefore, must be the people that you carefully select.","Frankly, that is all that the administration that you people have sent to Washington is trying to do.","Make certain they are men and women who, first, are unimpeachable in their approach to every public problem; that neither politics nor cronyism, nor hope of reward nor hope of favoring any particular class or group, has any influence on it; that they are motivated and inspired by one thing: what is the good of 160 million people? That must be, of course, the purpose in their hearts, but take a look at their heads.","You have to send people who are, by their reputations in their own localities, fitted to tackle such complex jobs as now plague a government. They have to be men that have established some success. And you have got to work out in your own mind, \"What kind of man do I believe is a good Senator, a good Congressman, a good Governor?\"","Incidentally, may I pause to say, you have so many good ones in California, you seem to know more about this, maybe, than I do.","But one thing I want to point out is this: we must not have doctrinaires. This world moves. We outlined, through our forefathers, a great set of principles in the Constitution, and that Constitution--through our Supreme Courts, through actions of the Congress and the Chief Executive down through the years--has been molded and modeled to our needs.","Our needs are not what they were 20 years ago. It is just as senseless, today, to talk about the social security of today in the same terms we would have talked about social security when there were free lands everywhere, and this country was a debtor country with great assets and resources yet to be explored, as it is to talk about taking off here and flying to the moon, instead of waiting for the 50 years that it is going to take for the scientists to show how to do it. It is just that silly, to talk about going back to that kind of thing.","Now, how do we get a man that is that flexible, that adjustable? We want men that can take and listen to facts, who are not so doctrinaire that every fact that is brought in front of them, if it doesn't agree with their preconceptions, it is just thrown out in the woodpile. That is a very necessary thing.","And I want to assure you that in the last 20 months I have watched some very great people making up the executive department--I have watched them work. I don't know of a single one who comes in with the theory--into the Cabinet meeting, or anywhere else--and with this theory fixed in the back of his mind forces everything to conform to it.","On the contrary, every one of them is supported by his own selected group of associates, of advisers throughout this country--from trade associations, from every kind of professional group, from businessmen--everywhere. Those people are the ones that come in and help formulate the policies that this group then tries to translate into recommendations for the legislature to consider.","What I am trying to show is this: that throughout the ten governmental departments, through the heads of agencies, of the FOA, and the Office of Defense Mobilization, and everything else, there is a very earnest attempt on the part of these people to get the opinion of the United States. There is a very great conviction there that the commonsense of the United States--if we avoid both extremes, and take the commonsense judgment of the United States, you have got a pretty good guide as to where we should move in legislation and in programs.","I commend, therefore, the kind of man whom you know to be absolutely unimpeachable in his honesty, who has shown by his standing in the community that he deserves the respect of that community, and who has been something of a success, either as a young man or at any stage of life.","And finally, a man who has got the flexibility of brain, in this day and time, to try to adjust the basic principles in which we believe, the liberty of the individual and his rights, and adjust to the problems that face us every day, whether it be in Indochina, Formosa, or whether it be right here in your great city of Los Angeles.","That is the kind of people that we need so desperately in Washington. And I think that you people who helped to send this administration there, if you will look at the character and types of people now occupying the executive positions, all the way from the Secretary of State on down to the newest appointee, that you can take some pride in the people that have been selected.","And largely, after the Cabinet is selected, remember, all these other people are selected by those Cabinet officers. So there is a wide geographical distribution among these people. There is a wide distribution of professional attainment in their particular specialties.","This same applies, of course, in the Congress, by their very nature being so representative. Our leaders--particularly Senator Knowland and his senior associates in the Senate, Joe Martin and the great Charlie Halleck, a very great lieutenant, their associates in the House--are really doing a remarkable job.","So, as we face this coming election, recognizing as we do that if you are going ahead with a positive program--and I am not going to take up your time this morning to outline this program again; it has been recited time and again in the newspapers, it has been on the television. As a matter of fact, some of you may know I made a little speech about it last night.","Now, of course, none of us is in detail going to agree entirely with that program, because no program, if it is made up as I have been trying to describe to you, is reflective of any single person's complete ideas. But if it follows the general purpose, the good of 160 million people, if it is supported by honest men and women who want nothing in the world but the good of those people, and if it has been intelligently, broadly based, then I think we have got something that we ought to be able to sell.","One of the troubles, of course, is that anyone who takes something of that kind to carry to the people is robbed, really, of the drama of the extremes. It is much easier, you know, to get up and say everybody is a so-and-so except my little gang and me, than it is to go out and sell a really constructive truth, because we tend to take it for granted.","Well, I think that the Administration, probably, is not capable of telling anybody how to dramatize these truths, these programs, and carry them out so that people will overwhelmingly accept them.","But I know it can be done. I believe that if you carry the truth to the people, that there will be only one decision from the mass of 160 million Americans.","I am going to end this little talk with a little story.","Not long ago, I went out to Illinois to the State Fair, and on the way I happened to pick up a paper that was on my airplane. And Paul Hoffman had had a little trouble there at Studebaker--you remember he had asked his union to take a lower wage, a wage they agreed was in conformity with the average. Studebaker had been well above it, I understood, so he asked them to go to two dollars-and-something an hour. He got his teeth kicked in, the first time he proposed it, although the president of the union was very much on his side--I believe his name was Horvath. This story was after they had voted the second time and the union had overwhelmingly voted to accept this cut and then go to work.","This union leader was interviewed by the press, and they said to him, \"Well, what do you think about all this?\" He said, \"Well, you know, I have found this: if you can just get time to tell your people the whole truth, they will always go along with the right thing.\"","It was a rather comforting thought to have this labor leader saying this, when we had so many wise-cracking so called intellectuals going around and showing how wrong was everybody who didn't happen to agree with them.","By the way, I heard a definition of an intellectual that I thought was very interesting: a man who takes more words than are necessary to tell more than he knows.","I hope that no one is going to get up and wisecrack at me and say, \"You've already done it.\"","I think, though, with those thoughts, and I do pray there is a little bit of commonsense and homely philosophy in them, that you will accept, now, my thanks for the cordiality of your welcome, for the great honor you have done me by inviting me to appear before you.","I assure you that within just about a half hour or an hour, I am to appear before another audience who are not going to be nearly as friendly.","Thank you very much."]}

It's wonderful to see all of you, all of the service personnel, all of your families, all the kids who are here. I thank you for coming. And I just want you to know I kept the rain away. They thanked me at the Air Force Academy, and I said, \"You know, when you're President, you get blamed for so many things you didn't do; it's okay to take credit for a thing or two you didn't do, either.\" But I'm very, very glad to be here, glad to see all of you. I want to thank Chief Master Sergeant Sue Turner for her introduction. If she were running for office, she'd get a lot of votes just on being brief, I think. And I thank her for what she said. I'm glad to be here with your Governor, Roy Romer, General Ashy, and others.","Earlier this month I want to say something serious, if I might, for a moment our Nation lost six patriotic reservists of the 302d Airlift Wing based here at Peterson. Today, I, as their President, just want to remember them with my respects, my gratitude, my thanks. And I'd like to ask if we could all just have a brief moment of silence in their memory, please.","Thank you very much.","Like the Rockies, the men and women here of Peterson stand tall and strong and proud. You're always ready. You are the sentinels of our air sovereignty. You're the home base for our Space Command and for NORAD. You are our eyes in space.","I did a couple of interviews yesterday with some Colorado newspapers, and one of them asked me if we still needed eyes in space since the cold war was over. And I said, the last time I checked we had more stuff up in space every day; I thought we needed more eyes, not fewer. I thank you for what you're doing.","You have made America safer. You have made the world safer. And as we face the new challenges of the 21st century, you know as well as I do that the American military will continue to play a vital role, not only in the defense of our freedom and our security but also in advancing the cause of democracy and freedom throughout the world.","We have seen painfully in the United States in the last several months, first at the World Trade Center and then at the awful incident at Oklahoma City, that our security can be threatened in a global economy with open borders and lots of personal freedom here at home as well as beyond our borders. We had those two terrorist incidents: One of them occurred from people I believe were deeply disturbed and way off track within our country; another occurred because this is a free country and people can come and go here, and people who bore us ill will and wanted to destroy a symbol of American democracy came into this country and set that bomb at the World Trade Center.","I'm also happy to tell you that other sentinels of freedom working to thwart terrorism stopped two terrible incidents that were planned, one to blow up another bomb in New York and another that was designed to take some aircraft out of the air, flying out of the West Coast going over the Pacific.","But we now know that the security threats we'll face in the future, rooted in terrorism and organized crime and drug trafficking, are closely tied to things the military has had to work on for years, trying to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stand up to rogue states, and protect our security interests around the world. We're going to have to fight on all these fronts, and you're going to have to continue to be the best trained, best equipped, best motivated, most flexible military in the world for us to succeed.","I am committed to making sure that you always are that and to doing whatever we have to do to improve the quality of life and the conditions of living, so that the best people in America want to be in the military and want to stay in the military.","Since I have been President, I have twice had to go back to Congress to ask for large appropriations totaling over $35 billion to help to maintain our training, our readiness, and our quality of life. And this year I asked the Congress for a supplemental appropriation to cover contingencies in the Defense Department so we could fund a pay increase at the maximum legal level allowable and continue to make improvements in readiness and the quality of life. We are going to continue to do that. If you're committed to serving America, the people who make the decisions about investments in your future should be committed to making sure that you can serve and succeed, that you can have good families and a good life in the United States military. And we are very grateful to you for that.","Let me say, what I most wanted to do was to have a chance to say thank you personally and to go down the row and shake hands with the children.

{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecommunitysandiegocalifornia","text":["Thank you so much. Thank you, Chief Emerson, Sheriff Kolender, District Attorney Phingst. Chief Sanders, thank you very much for the tour of your activities this morning and your statements. Thank you, Congressman Filner. Thank you, Madam Attorney General, for all the great work you do. I'd like to also say a word of appreciation for some others who are here who have not spoken today: our United States Attorney, Alan Bersin; the Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner, Doris Meissner; the person who was very active in helping me pass the crime bill which put these police officers on our streets, former Congresswoman Lynn Schenk, I'm delighted to see you here.","I want to thank all the officers who are here from the Customs, the Border Patrol, Immigration, from Chula Vista, from San Diego. I especially want to thank these uniformed officers who give their lives to make our lives safer and all the community citizens groups who work with them. Thank you all very much.","Ladies and gentlemen, when I came to California and to San Diego 4 years ago and I listened and attempted to learn what was going on here, I saw an enormous amount of potential and a lot of stress. Mostly what people talked to me about then were two problems, the economy and the problem of crime and illegal immigration. I spent a lot of time here 4 years ago and had the opportunity to come back often since. If you'll forgive me just one personal note, this is the first time I've come back to San Diego since the death of my friend Larry Lawrence, who served this country so well as our Ambassador to Switzerland, and I miss him now, coming back here, and I want to thank him for what he did for me here. Anyway, what we tried to do was to develop a serious approach, to work with you, to help you seize control of your destiny, and to help you do more of what you were already inclined to do.","On the economy, I'd like to make just a couple of comments. Because we're building two new ships for our national defense, the San Diego shipyards are busy, securing another 4,000 jobs until the year 2000. I think that's a good and positive step. Because in 1993 and 1994 the Congress agreed to invest in defense conversion, in high technology research and development and new environmental technologies and biotechnology, jobs are being created here that have a real future to grow in number and to strengthen and diversify the economy of this area. Because we've started work on a new sewage treatment plant and we're proposing to step up our sand reclamation efforts, thanks in no small measure to the relentless efforts of Congressman Filner, we're ensuring that the San Diego beaches will be enjoyed by children and their children for generations to come.","But we all know that America has had, building over years and years and years, a serious problem of illegal immigration which has aggravated the crime problem along our borders. The Attorney General talked about some of the progress we've made. She gave me a report today which reviews where we are and what we've done. So as we have worked hard to bring the crime rate down all over America, we've made special efforts in our border communities, because we know that we have special responsibilities there. Immigration laws are national laws, not State laws. They have to be enforced, and the consequences of their enforcement or their failure to be enforced have to be borne primarily by the National Government. I have done what I could to get more money into California in very difficult fiscal circumstances in Washington to help you deal with the costs of illegal immigration—more than ever before— and I will continue to work on that.","But the most important thing is we have to be able to work together to prove that we can do better. I agreed with what the district attorney said when he said there's a difference in being a safer community and a safe community. I agreed with what the sheriff said when he said that we'd never fully solve this problem until both the United States and our friends in Mexico are working together in a long-term and consistent way.","But think about how far we have come in the last 3 1/2 years. Three and a half years ago, many people believed that these problems were totally intractable, that drugs would always flow freely, that illegal immigration would always be rampant, that criminal immigrants deported for crimes they committed here in America would return the very next day to commit crimes again.","For a lot of years people in public life at election time talked tough about immigration, but didn't do much about it. We tried to change that. We tried to substitute deeds for words. It's a pretty good practice in a lot of areas of life, and I think it's worked pretty well here. Our message has been simple: We will work with you to give you the tools you need to patrol your streets, protect your children, secure our common border. And you have to do what you can to help the police to bring the crime rate down and make your community safe.","Well, you heard what the prosecutor said: San Diego has the 5th lowest crime rate in the country of the 75 biggest urban areas. I actually believe when the numbers come out this year, you'll be even lower than that. And it's a great tribute to the work that you have done together.","Let me say, again, while the job is far from over—and we have a lot of work to do—the report I got from the Justice Department makes clear that we have begun to turn border communities under siege into communities where law and order and safety and security are once again the order of the day. I want to say too, again, I'm glad that we're working to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America, that we're putting community policing in every community in the country that's willing to receive it. But what really makes it work are law enforcement officers committed to it and citizens groups working on it.","Today I had a very impressive briefing from people involved in the San Diego citizens patrol in the Safe Streets Now program. They are also helping your communities to be safer. The RSVP program is helping your community to be safer. So I ask you, don't stop now. We need more citizens working with more police officers until crime is the exception, not the rule. When you're surprised when you hear about a crime, then you'll know you've got a safe community. And you need to continue to do it.","The second thing we're doing is to put criminals behind bars. And after they serve their time, if they don't belong here in the first place, they're being deported. The crime bill gave us the weapons we need to do things that had not been done before to deal with the problems of criminal activities by illegal immigrants. As of January of last year, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on Federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported in the first place. We are changing the policy of this country on that problem.","We are also making strides in getting control of our border. We've added Border Patrol agents, in San Diego alone increasing by 762 the number of agents who are working for you by the end of this year. In El Paso, our border guards stand so close together, they can actually all see each other. [Laughter]","Here in San Diego, control has been taken back of Imperial Beach from the criminals and the illegals. We deployed underground sensors, infrared night scopes, encrypted radios. We built miles of new fences, installed thousands of watts of new lighting. There is more to do. I heard what was said earlier about the threats facing San Diego residents in East County, particularly with the onset of the fire season. Today I have asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, to send 20 more law enforcement officers to Cleveland National Forest, and they will be there by the close of business today.","Let me say one final word of appreciation here to the cooperation between the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials. What they have done here today, over the last several months—I mean, it ought to be something that we all take for granted. It ought to be the rule in every jurisdiction in America. It's a shame that it's rare, but it is rare, and we can be grateful that here there is one American law enforcement team. And I tell you, that's what we're trying to create for all the citizens of the United States, wherever they live.","And I am very proud of what they've done. They've put aside politics and put the people of this community first, their safety first, their future first. That's why there has been an 84 percent increase in felony drug prosecutions in one year. That's why murders and robberies and car thefts have dropped so much, because they're all working together and working for you, instead of protecting their turf and playing politics. And I say, God bless them, we need more like them all over this country.","Let me just say one other thing that affects Americans a long way from you, but I bet you've all identified with them in the past few months. Even as we crack down on illegal immigration and do more than has ever been done before on that, we must never forget that we are all a nation of immigrants and, except for the Native Americans, we all came from somewhere else. I say that to make this point: Our incredible diversity is a source of our rich potential as we move into this global society. Anybody who is willing to work hard, obey the law, respect their neighbors, and follow the values inherent in the Constitution ought to have a chance in America, and that ought to be the rule here.","And because we're people and because we're imperfect, the country will always have problems. There will never be a time when there will be no problems. But we really fall into a dangerous trap when we start blaming our problems on other people just because they are different from us.","I say that because even though I'm a long way from there, my heart has been in my native South for the last several weeks as we have dealt with this incredible rash of church burnings. That's just another way of people finding a way—trying to blame somebody else or put down somebody else or put distance between them and someone else in a totally dehumanizing way, forgetting that everybody should be treated equally before the law, in the eyes of our fellow Americans, just as we are before God Almighty. And to burn a church is a terrible thing. Just 2 days ago, I reported to the American people about what we were doing to deal with the church bombings. And then barely a day later yet another congregation, this one in Greenville, Texas, found its church in flames. We have got to stop these things.","We do have a team of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials working overtime to investigate these crimes. Just this morning, Federal investigators made an arrest for the burning of the church in Charlotte, North Carolina, last Thursday. And I do want you to know that for all the partisan fights you hear about in Washington, there is a bipartisan bill before the Congress, sponsored by a Democrat from Michigan, John Conyers, and a Republican from Illinois, Henry Hyde, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who attacks any house of worship, of any religious faith, of any race in America, and I urge Congress to pass it without delay.","We need to come together as one America to rebuild our churches, restore hope, and show the forces of hatred they cannot win, just as we need to come together as one America to say we are a nation of immigrants and we're a nation of laws. If you want to be in our country, you should be here lawfully. We will protect our people. We will enforce our laws. We will secure our future. And we will do it together.","Thank you, and God bless you all. "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthecongressionalcaucusforwomensissues","text":["Thank you, Eleanor, for that introduction. We've been friends a long time and, frankly, I had forgotten that I had done some of those things. Thank you, Nancy Johnson, Madam Secretary. Thank you, First Lady, for now spending more than half your life at least acquainted with me in some form or fashion almost half of it married.","I congratulate the members of the caucus on 20 years of leadership. I thank Women's Policy Inc. for hosting this event, and I am delighted to be here, not only with the Secretary of State but also with Audrey Haynes, the Director of the White House Office for Women's Initiatives and Outreach, and several other outstanding senior officials of the White House.","I, too, want to pay tribute to Margaret Heckler and Elizabeth Holtzman for their vision in creating this office, for the leadership that thank you for the past leadership of Olympia Snowe and Pat Schroeder, Connie Morella and Nita Lowey. And of course, to Nancy Johnson and Eleanor Holmes Norton, who show no lack of energy in pressing your cause with the President.","When Nancy mentioned there are now 52 members of this caucus in the House of Representatives, I was sitting next to Hillary, and I knew what she was thinking: That's about 52 too few. And I was thinking it, too, based on your record.","I think the thing that has been overlooked in this whole endeavor of trying to give more sensitivity to issues of special concern to women and trying to give women more opportunities to serve is that we live in an age where every public figure says, as if it were just a cliche, that the most important resource in any human endeavor in the private sector or the public sector is our people. And yet we cavalierly go on, in example after example after example, not giving all our people the chance to live up to the fullest of their God-given capacities and make the greatest service they can to the rest of us to promote the general welfare. I've done what I could to correct that, partly based on the example of my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, and partly because I have known so many of you personally, and partly because it is manifest that we have to find a way to reach across all the lines in our society and lift up everyone to the position of his or her highest and best use and potential.","In that connection, I would like to thank the newly confirmed Ambassador to the Vatican, Lindy Boggs, for her willingness to serve.","I've been proud to work with you on a lot of issues. Most of them have been mentioned tonightthe family and medical leave law, which has changed more lives than almost any bill that we've passed around here in a long time. Everywhere I go around the country now, people still come up to me and tell me personal stories of how that law changed their lives. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, the minimum wage, the child care, the adoption tax credit, increased child support enforcement, the family violence initiativesall these things have made a difference. The hand of this caucus was felt heavily in the recent balanced budget, with the single biggest aid to education increase since '65, the biggest increase in aid to children's health since Medicaid in '65, and the children's tax credit. So, the country is in your debt.","And I do believe that the bipartisan nature of this caucus has made a profound difference. I know that we're joined tonight by the Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, and I believe Speaker Gingrich wanted to be here and had to be in Georgia tonight. I know Mr. Gephardt would agree with me that all of us have been impressed by how you are able to stay together, work together, and, in Eleanor's terms, get down to business no matter how crazy things get in this occasionally loony town. And for that, too, we are all in your debt, for you set an example that everyone else should follow.","I'd like to talk just a moment about health issues. Hillary mentioned them and has worked on them so hard, and others have mentioned them. The budget not only provided for $24 billion to extend health coverage to 5 million children who don't have it, thus giving greater peace of mind to the parents who are raising them, both as parents and also when they're away at work, it did a lot more for the health of women. It expanded Medicare to cover bone mass measurement for women at risk of osteoporosis. Funding for osteoporosis research has now reached more than $100 million at NIH. It expanded Medicare to cover annual mammograms for all women over the age of 49 and eliminated the copayments to make these examinations more affordable. These were important things, and we have more to do.","We have to continue our focus on women's health. Since I took office, funding for breast cancer research, prevention, and treatment has almost doubled, and we've discovered two breast cancer genes, holding great promise for the development of new prevention strategies, something that's profoundly important to all of us who have ever dealt with this in our families.","We're unlocking the mysteries of the genetic code and continuing to discover new ways to diagnose and treat genetic disorders. But we know that these breakthroughs also bring with them the need for new protections. Studies show the leading reason women do not take advantage of new genetic breast cancer tests is because they fear they will be discriminated in health plans if the tests come out the wrong way. This is wrong, and it ought to be illegal.","So I want to work with you to get Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that will ban all health plans, group and individual, from denying coverage or raising premiums on the basis of genetic tests. After all, if we can get everybody to take the tests, if they know what they're up against, in the end we will prevent more severe illness, we will reduce cost to the health care system. And we shouldn't punish individuals for doing something that we know is not only in their own interest but is in the interest of society.","Also, legislation should prohibit all health plans from disclosing genetic information that could be misused by other insurers. It ought to protect researchers' ability to make the best use of this important tool. So, again, let me applaud those, especially Representative Slaughter and Senator Snowe, for their leadership. Genetic discrimination legislation deserves action now.","Let me also say that many of you in this room have contributed to our efforts to support legislation to protect women who have had mastectomies. They shouldn't be forced out of the hospital before they're ready because of pressure from a health plan. It's unacceptable that Congress has not yet held a hearing on the DeLauro-Dingell-Roukema 48-hour mastectomy patient protection bill, and we need to keep pushing for that.","And finally, we need to keep breaking down the doors and breaking through the glass ceilings and acting to bring women the full measure of economic and legal equity to which they're entitled. This caucus and our administration, under the leadership of Aida Alvarez, continues to work to counter the effects of discrimination and long-developed networks which hinder the success of women- and minority-owned businesses. I'm proud of the fact that the SBA in the last 5 years has tripled the number of loans to women businesses, and I thank you for your support of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, which has successfully increased the percentage of women- and minority-owned construction firms. I'm pleased to say that this has now passed both Houses, and I hope you'll keep up the fight so that it actually reaches my desk.","Twenty years after its creation, the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues commands the respect that you've always deserved. You now have a record you can be proud of. You work in a way that you can be proud of. You can feel the respect here in this audience this evening of all the people who have come to pay tribute.","Tonight is a night for celebration. We celebrate an initiative taken in 1977, a celebration of 20 years of hard work, of the many initiatives that you have accomplished. But most importantly, I'm here to celebrate the energy, the intelligence, the character, and the old-fashioned patriotic devotion to the task at hand that will bring you even more brilliant achievements in the years ahead.","Thank you, and God bless you."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthedigitaldivideandexchangewithreporters","text":["[SPEAKER]. Good morning. I just thought we ought to come out here in the brisk morning sunshine and wake up together. I want to thank the representatives here from all parts of the communications industry, from the foundation world, from various civil rights and other civic groups for being here, and coming in and giving me a chance to make this statement, because I had intended to go to Secretary Daley's conference today on bridging the digital divide, and because I'm going to Worcester, I couldn't do that. So they came in this morning, and we had a visit. I want to thank them for being here and for their commitment and for all those who aren't here but who are at the conference.","This conference is about closing the digital divide. And we have worked hard on that for the last several years in very specific contexts. Under the Vice President's leadership, we have worked to make sure that eventually a digital divide will not deprive business of the technology-savvy workers they need and will not hurt our educational systems today.","We started with the first NetDay in California, back in 1994, when only 3 percent of our classrooms were wired and only 14 percent of our schools were. And we've been working ever since. Now we know that, through the public-private partnerships that have been established all over America, through the Telecommunications Act and the E-rate, which the FCC set to make sure our poorest schools could afford to be connected, we're now up over 50 percent of the schools, from 3 percent, and over 80 percent of the classrooms, from 14 percent, since 1994. And I think that's pretty good.","I'm very pleased by that, and we're on our way to meeting our goal sometime next year of having all of our schools wired and, soon after that, all of our classrooms wired. I want to thank the Vice President and all the people in various industries who have supported us and helped us in this regard.","But as Secretary Daley's most recent \"Falling Through the Net\" report shows, there is still a lot more to do. We must connect all of our citizens to the Internet not just in schools and libraries but in homes, small businesses, and community centers. And we must help all Americans gain the skills they need to make the most of the connection. So this morning, as they go back to their meeting, I want to announce a series of new plans and partnerships that will expand on both these efforts to use the combined forces of public, private, and nonprofit sectors, finally to slam shut the digital divide.","First, I have decided to lead a prominent delegation, including top CEO's, on a new markets tour this spring to focus specifically on the digital divide out in America. As we've done on our previous tours, we will visit communities that have not fully participated in our Nation's economic growth. And yet, in the communities we'll also see how partnerships between the public and private sectors can unleash the power of the Internet to link children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to enhance safety, and foster economic development.","Second, I am signing an executive memorandum to ensure that closing the digital divide will be a vital goal not just for Secretary Daley and for us here in the White House but throughout the Federal Government. For example, I'm directing Secretary Daley to work with the private sector to develop a national strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet and directing Secretaries Daley, Riley, Herman, Cuomo, and Shalala to expand our growing network of community technology centers.","I just ask you all to think about this one thing. What do you believe the economic impact would be if Internet access and usage were as dense in America as telephone access and usage? I think it's clear that we need to keep working until we achieve this goal.","Third, with the help of many other groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is launching an initiative to empower the entire civil rights community through an expanding civilrights.org website, through leadership forums and even modern-day freedom riders who will bring high-tech training to the doorsteps of nonprofit organizations.","As the Congress of National Black Churches has said, the digital divide is a key civil rights issue of the 21st century. That's why our civil rights organizations must be ready, wired, and able to lead the change.","Fourth, the Benton Foundation is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software, and Internet industries, as well as the Urban League and several other large private foundations, to create the Digital Divide Network, an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities. For the first time, we'll have one-stop shop for tracking our progress in every community and for learning exactly what's worked and what hasn't.","Now, these are the steps we'll take immediately. I want to thank all the leaders who are here today who are making these initiatives possible and all of those who are going to announce specific things that they and their companies and organizations are doing at the conference. I thank them for the other major commitments they will make, because there is no single, big silver bullet here, but we know we have to have a national commitment to closing the digital divide.","I also want to send out an invitation to all of your counterparts around the country who are not able to be with us today but who should join with us in this great national endeavor. Together we have the power to determine exactly what we want the Internet to become. And what we want it to do is to be an instrument of empowerment, education, enlightenment, and economic advance and community building all across America, regardless of the race, the income, the geography of our citizens. And thanks to these people, we're going to be closer to achieving that goal.","Thank you very much."," "]}

I'm so grateful that many from the diplomatic corps are here.","This is a historic year for America. It's a year of great consequence. It's a year in which we have an opportunity to work with others to shape the future of our globe. We have a chance to achieve peace. We have a chance to achieve a more compassionate world for every citizen. America believes deeply that everybody has worth, everybody matters, everybody was created by the Almighty, and we're going to act on that belief, and we'll act on that passion.","You know, the world looks at us and say, \"They're strong.\" And we are. We're strong militarily, but we've got a greater strength than that. We've got a strength in the universality of human rights and the human condition. It's in our country's history. It's ingrained in our soul. And today we're going to describe how we're going to act, not just talk, but act, on the basis of our firm beliefs.","I want to thank Tommy; he's the new chairman of the board of the Global Fund. He's also the Secretary of Health and Human Services, doing a great job for our administration. I want to thank so very much the Ambassadors from Guyana and Uganda for standing up here with us today. I appreciate the other ambassadors from the continent of Africa and the Caribbean for being here.","With us as well is Bill Frist, a United States Senator, majority leader, passionate advocate of good health care for every citizen on the globe, a man with whom this administration will work, along with Russ Feingold, from Wisconsin, to make sure that the proposal becomes real. That means funded. There's no doubt in my mind that when you've got the majority leader and a distinguished Senator like Senator Feingold teaming up together, that this will get done. It's just a matter of time.","I'm honored that Mark Malloch is here Mark Malloch Brown is here, who is the U.N. administrator of the U.N. Development Program. I want to thank the U.S. Surgeon General Carmona is here with us. Rich, thank you for coming. Andrew Natsios is USAID administrator. Dr. Zerhouni of the NIH is with us. Tony Fauci is here with us. There are a lot of docs here today. Julie Gerberding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thank you all for coming today. Les Crawford is the deputy commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.","And of course, a man who is on my staff who is going to make an enormous difference here and abroad as a direct adviser to the President, and that's Dr. Joe O'Neill, who's the director of National AIDS Policy. He's about as fine a human being as you'll ever know. He cares deeply, and his care has had he's got a lot of influence, let me put it to you this way, because of his convictions.","As I mentioned, we're a strong nation, but we're also a blessed nation, and it's important for our citizens to recognize it. Richness is one thing; recognizing that we're blessed gives a different perspective, I think. I think it enhances the fact that we have a responsibility. If you're blessed, there is a responsibility to recognize your blessings in a compassionate way. Blessings are a two-way street. We've got to understand in this country that if you value life and say every life is equal, that includes a suffering child on the continent of Africa. If you're worried about freedom, that's just not freedom for your neighbor in America; that's freedom for people around the globe. It's a universal principle.","As I said in my State of the Union, freedom is not America's gift to the world; freedom is God's gift to humanity. Freedom means freedom from a lot of things. And today, on the continent of Africa, freedom means freedom from the fear of a deadly pandemic. That's what we think in America, and we're going to act on that belief. Our founding belief in human dignity should be how we conduct ourselves around the world and will be how we conduct ourselves around the world.","I want you all to remember, and our fellow citizens to remember, that this is nothing new for our country. Human dignity has been a part of our history for a long time. We fed the hungry after World War I. This country carried out the Marshall plan and the Berlin airlift.","Today we provide 60 percent over 60 percent of all the international food aid. We're acting on our compassion. It's nothing new for our country. But there's a pandemic which we must address now, before it is too late. And that's why I took this message to our fellow citizens, that now is the time for this country to step up our efforts to save lives. After all, on the continent of Africa, 30 million people have the AIDS virus 30 million people. Three million children under the age of 15 have the AIDS virus. More than 4 million people require immediate drug treatment. Yet, just about one percent of people receive drug treatment. I mean, there is a significant world problem that the United States of America can do something about. We can be involved.","Tommy mentioned the images, the horrible images, that take place in Africa. It's important for our fellow citizens, as they listen to the dialog on this initiative, to understand that there are mass burials and unmarked graves on the continent of Africa. So many people are dying that the graves are unmarked. The pandemic is creating such havoc that there are mass burials, that there are wards of children that are dying because of AIDS, not a ward, not some wards, but wards after wards full of dying children because of AIDS, that there are millions of orphans, lonely children, because their mom or dad has died children left, in some cases, to fend for themselves.","Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many folks don't seek treatment, and that's a reality. It's as if the AIDS pandemic just continues to feed upon itself over and over and over again, because of hopelessness. This country needs to provide some hope, because this disease can be prevented and it can be treated. That's important for our fellow citizens to know. Anti-retroviral drugs are now dramatically more affordable in many nations, and these drugs are used to extend the lives of those with HIV. In other words, these drugs are really affordable.","And when the treatment has come to Africa, it is also important for our citizens to understand the effect of that treatment. It's called the Lazarus effect. When one patient is rescued by medicine, as if back from the dead, many others with AIDS seek testing and treatment, because it is the first sign of hope they have ever seen.","We have the opportunity to bring that hope to millions. It's an opportunity for this Nation to affect millions and millions of lives. And so that's why I've laid out the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. I called it in my State of the Union a work of mercy, and that's what I believe it is.","With approval of Congress, we will devote $15 billion to the fight AIDS abroad over the next 5 years, beginning with 2 billion in the year 2004. I've been asked whether or not we're committed to the Global AIDS Fund. Well, first of all, I wouldn't put Tommy as the head of it if we weren't. And more importantly, he wouldn't have joined if we weren't.","And so we're still committed to the Global AIDS Fund to fight disease. This program in no way diminishes our commitment to the fund. We will continue bilateral AIDS programs in more than 50 countries. We've already got bilateral relations with 50 countries with whom we're working on AIDS, and we'll continue that program.","But this plan that I've laid out in front of the Congress, and will work with Members of the Senate and the House on, will dramatically focus our efforts. You notice I didn't say, \"focus our efforts,\" I said, \"dramatically focus our efforts.\" And that's important for the American people to understand, because we want to bring a comprehensive system. It's more than money that we bring; we bring expertise and compassion and love and the desire to develop a comprehensive system, work with people in Africa to do so, for diagnosis and treatment and prevention.","We are determined to turn the tide against AIDS. And we're going to start in 14 African and Caribbean countries, where the disease is most heavily concentrated. We whip it in those 15 or 14 we will show what is possible in other countries.","We're going to be involved with the fund. We'll continue to have bilateral aid. We want to have intense focus where the need is most severe and show the world what is possible not just show our fellow citizens or show the folks on the continent of Africa, but the world needs to see what we can do together. The model has been applied with great success in Uganda. Anybody who knows the issue of AIDS on the African Continent appreciates the efforts of Uganda. And we feel like that it can be duplicated, and that's the mission, the goal. Even though we're on 14 countries initially with this major focus, we understand there's suffering elsewhere. And we want to expand beyond. We want to encourage others to join us as well.","The funding will initially go toward expanding existing hospitals and, of course, drawing on the knowledge and the expertise of local physicians. That makes sense. You've got a doc in place, we want to encourage that doc to be able to continue his or her healing. We'll build satellite facilities that can serve more people. Of course, we'll provide antiretroviral drugs and as well work with folks on the ground for education and care.","It's important for our citizens to know that the infrastructure is it's hard for many Americans to imagine the lack of infrastructure that we're working with on the continent of Africa. So we use motorcycles, trucks, bicycles. We use nurses and local healers to go to the farthest villages and farms to test for the disease and to deliver medications that will save lives. It doesn't matter how the medications get there; what matters is they do get there.","Facilities across Africa and the Caribbean will have now the medicine. And our fellow citizens must understand that the reason they do is because of your generosity, the taxpayers of the country. I hope when our citizens absorb that knowledge the massive attempt to save lives that they feel proud of their country and proud of the compassion of America. We're going to work with other governments, of course, private groups there's all kinds of faith-based programs involved on the continent of Africa, and we welcome that, of course. And we encourage that. And we thank you for that.","A fellow named Father Edward Phillips is here. Where are you, Father? Right there, yes. I thought you were Father Edward Phillips for a minute. He is in Kenya, works in Kenya. He's obviously followed his faith. He leads an organization that provides testing and treatment in Nairobi. He's helped thousands of people every year. He ought to be giving this speech, not me, because he knows what it must feel like to play a significant role in saving lives. And that's what we're here to talk about today, how best to save lives.","And here's what the experts believe that will be accomplished through the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief: that in this decade, we will prevent 7 million new infections; that we'll treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs. We'll provide humane care, of course, for those who suffer and, as importantly, for the orphans.","To me, that's just the beginning. But it's a pretty good start. Most important thing is we're providing hope, which is immeasurable. How can you possibly measure the benefits of hope? There's no we can't quantify that. But it certainly can be qualified by saying a hopeful society is a heck of a lot better society than what they found on the continent today.","This project is urgent, and as we move forward on this program we will continue to call upon other nations to join. The United States doesn't mind leading, and we believe others have a responsibility as well, that we're not the only blessed nation. There are many blessed nations. And we hope they join us. And as well we've got a lot of work to do here in America. It's important for our fellow citizens never to think that one initiative or a major initiative in Africa doesn't mean we're going to forget the 900,000 people living in America today who carry the HIV virus. Of course we'll never do that. It's important for our citizens to understand that there's 40,000 new infections every year in this country. It's an issue. It's an issue we must continue to deal with.","The AIDS diagnosis still obviously brings tremendous grief and worries in parts of our society. And so the budget I've submitted and worked with Congress on will be a request for $16 billion for domestic HIV prevention and care and treatment; it's a 7 percent increase over '03. It's a $93 million increase for AIDS research. It's $100 million more to support the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. This is a program which provides funding to purchase AIDS-related medicines for those without health coverage. And we're going to help those abroad, and we'll help those at home as well.","We must also move quickly to increase the number of people who are tested for HIV. How can you treat if you don't test? How can you help if you don't know? And so the Food and Drug Administration recently has approved a new HIV test, which can provide results in less than 30 minutes, with a 99.6 percent accuracy.","So today I've got an announcement to make, and it's this: That the Department of Health and Human Services, after a lot of careful review, has waived regulations so that the test will soon be more readily available to doctors and public health facilities throughout the country.","As I've said, it's going to be a significant year for our country. I'm a person who believes that there's no obstacle put in our path that we can't overcome; I truly believe that. I love what our country stands for. I love the strength of America. The strength of America really is the lies in the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens.","As we move forward into the 21st century, there's no doubt we can help the people on the African Continent, while we help our own folks at home with the deadly disease. There's no doubt we can arrest the pandemic. There's no doubt we can bring hope in all parts of the world, not only in Africa but in neighborhoods in our own country where people wonder what the American Dream means. There's no doubt in my mind we can make the world more peaceful.","Today's initiative is one it's a step toward showing the world the great compassion of a great country.","Thanks for coming, and God bless."]}

But from very long and close observation of 34 years, it seems to me that President Wilson may have been describing the requirements for congressional page.","So, whether your experience on the Hill has been long or brief, each of you in this page class this morning has been through a very rigorous and a very demanding test. And I want you to know--each of you to know--that I am extremely proud of you.","From this point on you will turn upward along many different paths. All of you are exceptional young men with exceptional training. I am sure that in your choices of professions or other pursuits many of you will achieve exceptional success. Whatever your pursuit, however, I hope that the experience you have had at the heart of our representative democratic system will always be a part of your life.","Even if you do not choose a career of public service, I hope as private citizens you will live your lives with a high and an active sense of public duty and responsibility.","This is a time of change in America. All of us are awakening to the fact that America today is far different from the land into which my generation or your generation was born. The answers, the attitudes, and the approaches of 30 years ago, or 20 years ago, or even 5 years ago, are not now adequate to meet the new obligations or the new opportunities of the 1960's.","As one who shares with you a very abiding respect and affection for the Congress, I am especially gratified and pleased by the response that Congress itself has made last year and this year toward meeting the change of our changing times. Congress has done much to silence the critics and the cynics who have belabored it and who have attempted to downgrade it.","You can all be proud that you served during a season when the Congress of the United States was strengthened and revitalized as a functioning, responsive, and conscientiously responsible branch of our system of government. And I am pleased that at their own direction they are now engaging in a considerable amount of introspection and study on how they can make the Congress stronger and better and more effective.","As this is a changing land, so America stands as a part of the changing world. There are some who would have mankind believe that the only choices of these times are choices between political philosophies. Actually, I do not believe that this is the case. In a real sense, the choice facing men in every nation today, old or young, large and small, is a choice between moving into the modern world with all of its unlimited potential or turning back toward the restrictive world that is dominated by the dogma and the doctrine of the 19th century.","So, in your lifetimes, and in the lifetimes of a majority of the nations on earth, the total of human knowledge has doubled twice. The growth of human knowledge has made obsolete many of the causes of friction and contention and division among nations. Certainly the advance of human knowledge has made war itself obsolete and impossible as a means of resolving differences between large or small nations. Above all, the growth of human knowledge has rendered obsolete and archaic the doctrine on which the dogma of communism was constructed.","Man today has in his capacity the potential of ending human misery or ending human life. We can really, for the first time, see the promise and the prospect of eliminating hunger and poverty, illness, bias, and prejudice in our own land and, we would hope, all around the world.","So, this is the work that we want to do. And this is the work which your generation will do. And that is why I have said over, and over, and over again that we of the United States invite all peoples--East and West--to pull back their curtains, and to tear down their walls, and to come out of the darkness of dogma and walk all together in the bright light of human knowledge and human freedom toward the peace that mankind must make together, and must keep together, on this earth.","I have seen many classes of Capitol pages graduate throughout the years. I would say that the class of which you are members faces the brightest and the most thrilling and the most hopeful prospects of any. For never before have young men like yourselves had so sure and so strong a prospect of being a part of the constructive building of a sane and a sensible and a rational world.","Whatever profession you choose as your own, I hope you will never forget that the ultimate success of our system rests upon the contributions that every citizen makes to public service.","And I would hope that as the days and weeks go by that you would, too, engage in a little introspection and ask yourselves, upon occasions at least: What did I do today to make my country better, to make it stronger, to make my Government more efficient and more useful? And whether as the elected or the elector you will have a great opportunity to be leaders of your times in fostering the responsible and the responsive politics that is needed at every level--local and State, as well as national and international ?","You have been privileged to know some of the great leaders of these times in the legislative halls. And I hope that when your time comes you will keep faith by being leaders then in the cause of peace and freedom for the world, and for progress for all of humankind.","I went to sleep last night after reading a letter from a mother who was the mother of only one child, and that boy was now 20 years of age. And she had just gotten a letter from him and he said in 20 days he would be on his way to Viet-Nam. And she said, \"Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I hesitate to take your time to write this letter, but I did not want to see my boy go away unless and until I could have your assurance that our Government and our country needs that boy and needs him where he is going.\"","He had lost his father. He was an only child. It was a difficult letter to dictate an answer to, but I had to write it this morning. And I told her that our liberty and our freedom was so precious, and liberty and freedom was in danger. And we had to call upon those who were capable and equipped to help us protect it. And all of us in our own way were doing the very best we could to preserve freedom, and that I did think it was necessary.","The mother had said in her letter that if t felt that, that she wouldn't, under any circumstances, object, although she did have to admit that while she did not want him out of the service, and she did not want him not to face up to his duty, she had to admit that she did not look with any favor to his going to that place at this time.","So, those of you who in a short time will be in the service of your country in one capacity or another, know how blessed you are to live in a system that was inherited by you as the result of the sacrifice of many thousands of young men like yourselves.","I believe that as you leave your present work that you will have gained from the halls of the Congress a sense of duty and a sense of responsibility that will always make the job of serving your country a pleasant one for you.","Thank you very much."]}

And although I wasn't here, I am grateful and understanding of the loyalty and the appreciation you had for that great man whom I succeeded and for whom this park was named.","We have tried to carry forward his program, put it on the statute books, and execute it as he would have had us do.","The last 2 days we have traveled throughout the northeastern part of the United States and New England and we have talked about the problems of our people.

But we haven't been talking party matters. We have been talking people matters; problems of people. We don't want to just talk about problems all the time. We want to talk about our successes, too. And I am going to do that tonight.","Two years ago I stood on the steps of the city hall in Portland and I quoted from a message that Governor Joshua Chamberlain once sent to the Maine legislature. Governor Chamberlain said:","\"A government has something more to do than govern and levy taxes to pay the Governor .... Government must also encourage good, point out improvements, open roads of prosperity, and infuse life into all the right enterprises.\"","I promised the citizens of Maine that night that we would try to follow that course if we were selected for this place of leadership.","And I have come back tonight to report that we have lived up to that promise. Your Government--and I think it is very important that each of you always remembers this is your Government, not my Government-this is your Government and it has been infusing life into one right enterprise after another. And we have just only begun.","And I think there is no better example of this than the promising new Maine project that we call the Dickey hydroelectric project. We are going to put more than $300 million into this project, and every single one of those dollars will be a good, sound investment in the future of a stable Maine and in the future of all America.","I have two brilliant young men on my staff from the State of Maine: Milton Semer of Auburn and Hal Pachios, my Associate Press Secretary, from Portland.","They are both good lawyers and good citizens. But we were talking the other evening and one of them said, \"You know, Mr. President, so many people have been listening so long to the old voices that constantly talk about big government, that they haven't caught up with the fact the United States is a very big country.\"","Our population increased by more than 2 million people alone just last year. Half a century from now we will have over 400 million Americans.","So we cannot have a stagecoach government in the era of orbiting astronauts. Government has to keep up with the times, and it has to stay ahead of the problems. For too long we have lagged behind and now we are trying to catch up.","I came here tonight to pledge to you good people--who are Americans first, but select the best government you know how--I came here to pledge you that as long as I lead this country we are going to keep up and catch up.","But I came here to say something else. Building a Great Society is not the job of a President alone. It is not the responsibility of the leaders of the Congress--some of whom are here with us this evening--alone. It cannot be done in Washington alone. It has to be the goal of every man and woman, every boy and girl. Every one of you has to pitch in and improve the corner of the country that you live in.","We can pass laws to bring justice to all our people, whatever their color. We can spend money for housing, education, and training. But until we have a domestic good-neighbor policy on every block, in every city, on every roadway, there is going to be racial strife in America.","We can start new programs to try to clean up the ghettoes of our cities, but until the people who live in our suburbs are color blind, there will continue to be discrimination in America.","We can establish training programs for young people who need a second chance, but until law-abiding citizens give them their second chance, there is going to be delinquency in America.","So if I could write just one letter to every American citizen tonight, I would make it brief, but I would try to make it directly to the point. And I would say something like this:","\"My fellow American, democracy depends on whether you are willing to conduct yourself as if the destiny of many others were in your hands, as if the future and the character of our Nation were to be decided by what you are and by what you do. Live every day with the knowledge that America is the sum total of all the decisions that you and people like you are making this very hour.\"","I would write that letter because I believe that what America needs more than it needs anything else right now is a strong dose of self-discipline. We need it to carry through and to support our men who are in the rice paddies of Vietnam tonight. We need it to bring racial peace and social justice to all our citizens in the United States. We need it to bring education to the mind and health to the bodies of all of our boys and girls in this country tonight. And we need it to maintain the strong economy that gives all of our people good jobs at good wages tonight.","Because never forget that no matter how many harassing, frustrating problems you may have, the strong economy is the underpinning of America's material strength. Let me illustrate what I mean.","People are talking a lot about inflation this election year. These same people used to talk a lot about unidentified flying objects. Well, now, what is inflation? Where is it going? Where did it come from?","I don't know the answers. But I do think that we should try to put the problem of inflation into perspective--and not just in terms of the early 1930's when prices were very low but few people had many dollars to buy much with.","I mean the perspective that comes from looking at both sides of the prosperity coin --looking at the rising prices without forgetting the rising standard of living.","There is poverty in America. We talk a lot about it these days--and we are doing a lot about it. There is want and there is some hunger--there is more of each than any of us would like to have. But I think most of you people that I am looking at here tonight in Lewiston, like most of my fellow Americans that I have seen in over 25 States, are tonight enjoying the best standard of living that you have ever known.","Now it may be in the 1930's some of you were doing better. It may be in the 1940's some of you were doing better. It may be in the 1950's some of you were doing better. But I think the majority of us are doing better now than we have ever done before.","Now prices have gone up. They have gone up 10 percent since 1961. And they will probably go up again. During that same time, though, wages have gone up, too. And they are going up some more. They have gone up not 10 percent as the prices have, but the wages have gone up 17 percent and most of you can buy more tonight than you could with your paycheck 6 years ago.","In 1966 the average wage--I try to make this as understandable as I can--the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much in the retail stores as it would when I came to Washington in 1931.","I want to repeat that because I want all of you to listen to it. In 1966, the year of our Lord tonight, the average wage of a factory worker will buy twice as much at retail as it would when I first came to Washington in 1931.","You could buy more bread, and more butter, and more milk, and more molasses, and more bacon with one hour of your earnings last year than you could in 1960. And that is also true of steaks, and potatoes, and tomatoes, and liver--if you ever eat it.","It is a fact that Americans are eating better food at a lower real cost than they have ever eaten before. After you get through paying your taxes--to all the Presidents and Governors and I don't know whether Senators and Congressmen think they have anything to do with it or not--but after you get through paying your taxes, your family is spending 18 percent of its income on food, 18 percent tonight, this year, compared to 26 percent of its income that it was paying 20 years ago.","So, I repeat--prices have gone up, and they are going to go up some more. We are going to do our best to have stabilization, but they have gone up and they will go up some more--but so has your standard of living gone up. And it is going up some more, too.","We have a goal, we have an objective, we have a future for America. We want to leave this world better than we found it. We have advantages that our fathers and our grandfathers didn't have. And we want our children to have things that we don't have ourselves.","So, prices have gone up and your standard of living has gone up, too. I hope you will keep that in perspective.","You know, I think that may have been what President Franklin Roosevelt's friend meant when he saw President Roosevelt during the 1940 campaign. You remember President Roosevelt asked him how he was voting. And his friend said, \"Republican.\" \"How come?\" President Roosevelt asked. \"Is the third term bothering you? .... No,\" the friend answered, \"that's not it at all. It's just that I voted Republican the first time you ran\"--this fellow lived in Maine, not in Lewiston, but in Maine--\"and I voted Republican the second time you ran\"--that was 1936, you know--\"And I am going to vote Republican again, because I seem to have never had it so good!\"","Now this is not to say that we should or we will ignore the threat that is made to our stabilization program and that comes with inflation. But keeping things in perspective will not chase the threat away.","I want you to know that, as your President, every day that I open my office I am going to be concerned about rising prices and will try to do as much as I intelligently can about them.","But I am as deeply concerned with finding the right way to deal with inflation. And that brings me back to my central point.","This morning at the University of Rhode Island I said along with rights we have responsibilities.","Tonight I want to leave this point: self-discipline.","The ideal way to keep the economy healthy without inflation is restraint--restraint on the part of those whose decisions have a real impact on prices. And I am looking into a lot of faces of people who make decisions that can probably have more impact on prices than I can.","For 2½ years now I have urged business and labor in many, many conferences I have had at the White House to bargain responsibly to reach decisions that will not trigger inflation.","And I am proud to report to you that many businessmen and many labor leaders have responded with restraint and with self-discipline to their President's pleas.","I am sad to report to you that not all of them have, and as a result we are faced tonight with a real danger to the prosperity which you have enjoyed for 6 consecutive years.","I would like for all Americans to know, those who can hear it and those who can read, unless there is restraint now, unless there is voluntary self-discipline by management and labor, then your Government will be compelled by sheer necessity to act in order to protect all of the people.","For in a democracy, the interest of all the people is, and should be, always overriding. And it is Government's duty and it is your president's duty, and he will exercise that duty by trying to reason--\"come reason together\"--to protect that interest.","But if, after we reason and after we appeal for self-discipline, after we ask for restraint, there are still general excesses, then I pledge you tonight we are going to protect your interests.","Now that sums up about all I have to say on the inflation problem. This will end my speaking for this week--at least this Saturday. I have told you the general subjects we have discussed.","I just want to conclude by talking about one that we have not discussed.","We have been talking about problems. But I want to talk about successes. I want to talk about the day in America when we have 76 million people working, working full 40-hour weeks, some of them drawing good overtime, working at an average factory wage in excess of $112 per week-the highest in the history of this Nation-more people working, getting more pay, than at any time in the history of this Nation. We have the best education and health programs that any government has ever inaugurated. Our citizens are eating more. They are wearing more. Their children are going to better schools.","They are driving better automobiles and more of them--some people even have two. They are living in better homes, although all of them don't have good homes. And except for our problems in Vietnam, we have so much to be thankful for.","So when you go home tonight after having listened to those whose principal job all day has been complaining, to those who got up on the wrong side of the bed and have been martyrs all day long, feeling that nobody loved them and they had been mistreated, just think about what other country you would like to trade your citizenship in for.","Just think about what other flag in the world represents as much to you as that one does. Just think of what boy and girl that you know who has more constitutional rights, more liberty, more freedom, more educational opportunity, more care of their body and their health, more opportunity for recreation, more opportunity to make individual decisions and be independent of everybody than you have here in America.","I have never felt that our people were unreasonably demanding. I think the average American doesn't ask much, doesn't expect much, doesn't have to have much.","He wants a church where he can worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. He wants a home where he and his wife can raise their family in comfort. He wants a job where he can earn enough to meet his responsibilities as a parent. He wants to be able to provide health care for his growing family and security for his old age.","And he may want to go to a park or a seashore once in a while, or even a movie, or to sit and listen to television. But outside of that, that is about all he asks for. And most of us have that and we ought to be thankful for it.","So if I could leave one thought with you, finally. I have gotten great strength from visiting with you and looking into your faces and giving you my views. I have learned something from you, too, you people in the five States that I have visited.","I can go back and listen to the complainers-if there be any in Washington--the commentators, I can hear their individual viewpoints. But I will have enough strength to make my judgments and my decisions, because every man that's ever been President of the United States wants to make the right decision.","No man who has ever been President, whether it was Hoover, Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Truman, or Kennedy--every single man that has ever been President, wanted to do what is right. Their great problem is knowing what is right because most of the decisions that come to a President are balanced just like this. The easy ones are settled by the Congressmen, the Senators, and Governors.","Last week or the week before, when we settled the airlines strike the first time, before the machinists had had their vote on it and had a chance to express themselves, I picked up some of the leading journals of this country which really have a good deal of information on a good many subjects.","One of the editorials said that I was a dictator, and I had arrogance of power, and I twisted arms, and I had brought about an agreement. That made me sad, because I don't like for people to say ugly things about me and I don't want to be a dictator.","And then, the next day they didn't ratify the contract. They turned it down and a week went by. Some of the writers had to ride a train from New York to Florida instead of being able to go by airplane. So then they said, not that he was a dictator, but they said, \"Why doesn't he show some leadership?\"","So then I was talking to Ed Muskie about it. I said, \"I am between the devil and the deep blue sea. I don't want to be a dictator; I do want to have some leadership. Now how do I go about it?\"","He said it reminded him of the story about the fellow and the donkey. He said, \"A man was walking along with a donkey. Someone said, 'Why would a man want to lead a donkey? Why doesn't he ride it?' Said he got on the donkey and the little boy he had with him was walking along beside him. Someone said, 'Why did that old, big man get on a donkey and let that little boy walk?' So the fellow said, 'OK,' and put the little boy on the donkey.","\"As they went on down the road a little bit, one of these complainers saw the little donkey coming along with the man and the boy both on it and they said, 'Why do those two big men ride that poor little donkey?' And they went on down a little bit further and finally someone said, 'That is an outrage! Why don't - they carry the donkey?'\"","Now dissent, different viewpoints, different objectives are the strength of America. We don't all see everything alike or we would all belong to the same church, we would all wear the same clothes, we would all drive the same automobile, and we would all want the Same Wife.","It is this difference and this right to express it that makes this the most powerful, the most wealthy, the most stable nation in all the world.","But while we are exercising all these rights we have, all these liberties we cherish, all these privileges that we claim, let's not ever lose completely our perspective. Let's not start feeling so sorry for ourselves that we fail to be thankful and that we fail to realize really how many blessings we have. Thank you, and good night."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalhispanicfoundationforthearts","text":["Well, first of all, let me say thank you for the welcome. I thank the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who are here and other Members of Congress and the people from our administration who are here. I want to thank Jimmy Smits and Felix Sanchez. And I want to congratulate your honorees, Sara Martinez Tucker and the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, for 25 years of service. I want to say a special word of appreciation to all the Latinos who have been part of our administration, including Maria Echaveste, Mickey Ibarra, Brian Barretto, Aida Alvarez, Bill Richardson, and all the others.","Let me say, I'm sorry I'm not in proper attire tonight. But Jimmy Smits called me this afternoon, and I only had two other things I was supposed to do, and so he said I had to show. And I want you to know I am here in spite of the fact that Jimmy Smits called me. And I'll tell you why. If I have to hear Hillary say one more time, \"That is the best looking man I have ever seen,\" I think I will die.","So, right before I was here, I went over to the Kennedy Center. And there's a magnificent event at the Kennedy Center that Kerry Kennedy Cuomo is having about her book on human rights activists, and artists from all over our country and human rights heroes from all over the world are over there tonight. And so, I went from there to a book party for my friend Paul Begala. And I'm on my way over here, and everybody wanted to know where I was going. And this NBC television reporter said, \"Jimmy Smits, that's the best looking man I ever saw in my life.\"","So, I said, \"Well, what can I tell you? I've been to war for 8 years now, and I don't look very good anymore.\" He will never forgive me for embarrassing him like that.","I want to say something seriously. Felix, I appreciate what you have done so much with this foundation. And I want to say, I made fun of Jimmy Smits tonight, but I want you to know that becoming a friend of his has been one of the real joys of being [SPEAKER]. He has been so kind to my wife and to me, to our family. He's been to the White House many times, and he's always been there for a good cause. And I hope you'll forgive me for pulling your leg tonight, Jimmy, but I'll never forget you for being our friend. Thank you very much.","I want to thank the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts for giving young people a chance. From the silver screen to the Broadway stage, kids with talent and dreams need a chance. That's what we've tried to do for 8 years now for all America's children. And the Vice [SPEAKER] and I owe those of you who have done so much to help us do that a profound debt of gratitude, and I thank you.","Tonight I came mostly just to do that, just to say thank you, for all you do for the arts, for all you do for the Hispanic community, and for all you've done to help America move forward in the last 8 years. We now have the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate we've ever recorded, the lowest Hispanic poverty rate in a generation, a million new homeowners in the last 6 years. The earned-income tax credit has been doubled, and it's lifted over a million Hispanics out of poverty. The minimum wage helped 1.6 million Hispanic workers, and it's time to raise it again and help more.","The Hispanic Education Action Plan to encourage Hispanic youth to stay in school and go to college, along with our scholarship initiatives and other things, have contributed to the fact that the college-going rate among Hispanic young people is up over 50 percent in the last 7 years. And—listen to this—a report which was issued last week said there has been a 500 percent increase in the number of Hispanic students taking advanced placement courses in high school to prepare for college.","Under the Vice [SPEAKER]'s leadership, we've reduced the naturalization backlog at INS. And under Aida Alvarez's leadership, loans to Hispanic entrepreneurs by the SBA have increased by 250 percent.","We have all been enriched by your work. And I know that because of your work, we'll have more great singers, more great writers, more great actors and actresses. I know we've got a long way to go, too, because still Latino characters are only about 3 percent of those that appear on prime-time television. I just left Rita Moreno, and I told her that I enjoyed watching her as a nun on her television series. And we were laughing about it. And I think that you will see, if you keep working, though, more and more of our movies and our television shows and our Broadway shows reflecting the rich diversity of America.","And that's the last point I want to make. I have said on many occasions, and I'll just say one more time tonight, that if I could have only one wish for America, believe it or not, it would not be for a continued unbroken economic prosperity. It would be that somehow we would find the wisdom to live together as brothers and sisters, to truly be one America across all the lines that divide us.","And to—just sort of a little picture of how fast America has changed; you may see the advertisements today for—they're on television now—for Denzel Washington's new movie about the integration of T.C. Williams High School over in Alexandria, Virginia, and its football team, which occurred—what—almost 40 years ago, not such a long time ago once you've reached my age, anyway. Now, a little over three decades later, that high school is in a school district which has students from over 180 different racial and ethnic groups, parents speaking over 100 different native languages. It's the most diverse school district in America.","And I think it's sort of fitting that this movie, coming out in the new millennium, talks about something that to most of these kids is ancient history, that we hope they'll never forget. But it's sobering to look at the profile of them and realize that they are both the great opportunity and the great challenge of the future: Can we figure out a way to give them all a world-class education, with all their diversity? Can we figure out a way to make sure that every single child, every family, every faith in America is profoundly proud of its roots, understands them, and yet believes deep in the core of being that our common humanity is even more important than our unique characteristics? These are very big questions.","Not so long ago, a number of you in this room came to the White House for a showing of \"Mi Familia,\" the movie. Remember, you saw it; you were there. And so I was thinking about that tonight and feeling sort of nostalgic. And I think the central question that all of us have to ask ourselves, both within and beyond our borders now, is who is in our family anyway?","There is an astonishing new book out, been out a few months, by a man named Robert Wright, called \"Non Zero,\" kind of a weird title unless you're familiar with game theory. But in game theory, a zero-sum game is one where, in order for one person to win, somebody has to lose. A non-zero-sum game is a game in which you can win, and the person you're playing with can win, as well. And the argument of the book is that, notwithstanding all the terrible things that happened in the 20th century— the abuses of science by the Nazis, the abuses of organization by the Communists, all the things that continue to be done in the name of religious or political purity—essentially, as societies grow more and more connected, and we become more interdependent, one with the other, we are forced to find more and more non-zero-sum solutions. That is, ways in which we can all win.","And that's basically the message I've been trying to preach for 8 years here, that everybody counts; everybody deserves a chance; we all do better when we help each other. We have to have an expanding idea of who is in our family. And we in the United States, because we're so blessed, have particular responsibilities to people not only within our borders who have been left behind but beyond our borders who otherwise will never catch up if we don't do our part, because we are all part of the same human family and because, actually, life is more and more a non-zero-sum game, so that the better they do, the better we'll do.","Now, I believe, because of the history and culture, because of the pain and the promise of the Hispanic community in the United States, you are uniquely qualified to make sure America learns this lesson now.","And so that's the last thing I'd like to say from the heart. You have made being [SPEAKER] this last 8 years a joy. It has been an honor for me to work with so many of you. If our country is better off because of anything I did, I am grateful. But all the best stuff is still out there if we can learn to preserve what is special about us and our clan, our tribe, and our faith, and do it while affirming our common humanity. Do that for America, and the best is still out there.","Thank you, and God bless you."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthenationalsalutethepresidentandhisblackappointees","text":[" ","[SPEAKER]. Thank you, Josh Smith, and all of you. Thank you very much, Josh, and thank all of you. My heavens, 27 different States, I'm told, represented here by all of you. Josh, I can't begin to thank you, not only for your friendship and loyal support but your service to the Government, to the people, I would put it that way, and also for your outstanding commitment to small business and your own accomplishments in that field.","I also want to acknowledge Josh's wife, Jackie Jones-Smith, who is the Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; my old friend Milton Bins here, chairman of the Council of 100. Kay James from the Office of National Drug Control Policy gave up an awful lot to move over there to fight this drug scourge, and I'm very proud of her.","Reverend Thad Garrett, we all know Thad. He ought to be praying more and talking less out there on the campaign -- -- I need that, I'll tell you. But somebody once gave me a little rug, and it said, \"What would we do without friends?\" I am grateful that Thad and so many others out here are true and loyal friends. When the going is tough, they're hanging in there.","I want to salute Fred Brown, the chairman of the National Council of Black Republicans. I was very grateful to Reverend Larry Haygood for that invocation, for his leadership in education, for his commitment and faith. Thank you, sir, for coming and for doing that.","Of course, I can't say too much about Lou Sullivan. I love it when we talk about genuine health care reform for this country. He summarized it in his remarks there, giving me the credit. But he's out there on the cutting edge. When a paper like the New York Times, which has not been overly friendly to me this year -- -- points out that we've got a sound, or the best of the health care reform programs out there, why, I'm very grateful to Lou. He's tireless in taking the message across the country, and he's leading this, the largest Government bureau, with such distinction and honor. I tell you, we're lucky to have him in the Government.","Ginger is not clapping too hard. Maybe she wants him back; I don't know. But nevertheless.","May I salute Gary Franks, distinguished Member of Congress. I don't see him, but I know he's here. Where's Gary? Well, he's not here. All right, he's late. He's to be here; Andy Ireland, a Member of the United States Congress, with us here today, too.","I want to single out a warrior. Some of you know her just by seeing her on television. Some of you know her for seeing her at my side as I climb on the helicopter or Air Force One or go to take on some political debate. And I'm talking about Marlin's able deputy, Judy Smith, who is standing right over here. Judy, I don't want this to come out wrong, but you talk about tough women. I mean, she is strong, and in a wonderful way. She takes it and can dish it out just as well. It is tough out there in that press arena. But boy, she's doing a superb job for me and I think for the country because she gets out our position on fundamental issues that are important to the Nation.","Let me just talk for a few minutes. I'm off to Wisconsin in a few minutes and then to New Jersey. So I want to just talk a little bit about the concerns that we share about the future of this great country, about the choice that we have in shaping that future. I will spare you a stemwinding political oration, but I will just point out that we've got a great task before us, and the differences are clear. With the end of the cold war that Reverend Haygood very generously referred to, now we've got to turn our attention to winning the new global economic competition.","The other side is telling us everything that's wrong about the economy, and I'll accept my share of the blame. But we're caught up in something worldwide. And any fair-minded observer knows that it's not just the United States that's had difficult economic times. It's England. It's France. It's Canada. It's Germany now. A lot of countries in this, and we have the strongest economy of all of them. It's my objective to make it even stronger. I call that winning the peace, for only then will we keep the promise of opportunity that is the birthright of every American. I am proud of the fact that our kids go to bed at night without that same fear of nuclear weapons that their predecessors had. This is, I think, a significant accomplishment, and I salute everyone in our administration that worked to help end that nuclear nightmare.","But now we've got to do the same thing, apply that same leadership, and lift this country up. You know, the Governor, Governor Clinton, and I offer very different choices. They're really based on very different philosophies, different experience. He's spent most of his life in government. He believes that government, kind of a Washington elite, should take the lead in shaping the economy. He uses the word \"investing\": investing your money, that's taxpayers' money, more wisely than you can as entrepreneurs and individuals.","Well, that's not the way I see it at all. Like so many of you, I've spent exactly 50 percent of my adult life in business and 50 percent in government. Not with the sparkling success that some in this room have had as business people, but nevertheless, I understand it. I built a business from the ground up. I met a payroll, created jobs, and worked for a living. I happen to think that that is a good qualification for being [SPEAKER] of the United States, because I believe it's a prospering small business or large business environment that's going to do more to help people. Put it this way, a job in the private sector is going to do more to help people than Government programs can.","I learned in that private sector what many of you not only have learned but have mastered: what makes an economy grow. It is not central planning, quote, \"investing,\" unquote, the taxpayers' money. It is not the people who take your taxes and spend them. It is you who make the economy grow, ordinary men and women with the extraordinary dreams who have the grit to make those dreams real. And I'm very grateful to what Josh does in taking this message of small business out around this country.","That understanding is really at the heart of what Larry Haygood again referred to as the Agenda for American Renewal. I talk about the global economy and then what we're going to do now to be the lead. We are the only remaining military superpower. We have the strongest economy; I want to help make it stronger. I want to see us become an export superpower as well. To do this, we've got to unleash the energy, the brainpower of our workers and our entrepreneurs, and again, particularly in small business because this is the area that employs the most and takes the risks and creates the new opportunities.","I want to encourage investment so that wages rise and those unemployment lines shrink. That's why I'm helping small business in particular and, hopefully, all business in general. We unveiled a good small business program the other day down in North Carolina. I'll just touch on a couple of points: Reducing the corporate tax rate for small business 15 percent to 10 percent; increasing the amount of equipment that small business can expense, and thus that would create more jobs and new opportunities; simplifying the tax filing. Most small-business people know that the onerous reporting for tax purposes takes too many work hours, too many people hours, and we're trying to change that. Then, of course, I still feel that to stimulate risk-taking, the reduction in the capital gains is very, very important, bringing people into the enterprise zones in the minority areas; a reduction in capital gains, a break on that will help attract jobs to the areas that need it the very most.","So to the business people here, we are trying to streamline so you won't have to be second-guessed back here in Washington by some bureaucratic establishment. And that's why we've put an end to the Federal regulations that turn redtape into pink slips. We just put out a moratorium on them. We're going to go forward with safety and health; obviously we have to do that. But we've got a moratorium, a blanket on new regulations, recognizing that there is too much control and regulation on the back of the small entrepreneur and the small-business person.","We really do want to do what Lou was talking about, and that is to make health insurance available to everyone. We want to make health care more accessible and more affordable for everyone. That's why we're all -- have our shoulders to the wheel, fighting for health care reform without burdening small businesses with expensive new mandates and more payroll taxes.","Our program is good. It keeps the quality of American health care where it belongs, number one in the entire world, and still says to those who cannot get insurance, we're going to make it available to you through pooling, and also we're going to reduce the costs. We're doing something about these crazy malpractice suits and also doing something about lifting the regulatory burden and streamlining the operating processes of our health care system.","So we've got a good program there, and I hope that it'll get the kind of support in the very next Congress that we need to have it enacted into law.","I want to reward the risktakers who bring capital and jobs to our inner cities; I touched on that. But it's very interesting to me that when we went to Los Angeles in the wake of the South Central problems, all the civic leaders there were saying we must have enterprise zones. It's an idea whose time has come. We ought to try it at the Federal level. So we're fighting hard to bring the enterprise zones into reality.","On issue after issue, you see the very sharp differences between my opponent and me, because he really does want a Government. He's already proposed more taxes, more spending, more regulations. He's already proposed programs that would result in the latter, in the last item, and tax plans and spending plans that would tax at the outset $150 billion more in taxes and $220 billion more in spending. It's going to kill off a lot of small business.","So we want to free up, instead, the genius of American enterprise and initiative. This is going to be one of the clearest distinctions as people begin to really make up their minds on this election.","Let me be clear: I am not anti-Government. Government must never shirk its responsibilities. The fine men and women honored here today who I've been proud to have at my side for the past 3 years are a testament to the good work that Government can do. We believe it's Government's role to create opportunity, though, and not stifle it, and to clear the path for individual accomplishment, not to block it; to facilitate, not to dictate. Together, we believe that there is no room in our country, and I want to repeat this here, for discrimination of any kind whatsoever. As long as I am [SPEAKER], I am going to do absolutely everything I can in my power to drive bigotry and anti-Semitism and racism from our great land.","You know, I hope you know that I have strong feelings about this. Lou and Josh and I were talking. I'm not sure the American people know how strongly I feel about this. That's one of the reasons I hope we get these debates on. We've proposed four debates with the Governor. Let him step up now and debate. We've accepted his formula for two of them, and so, we'll have an opportunity there without any filters, without any Monday morning quarterbacks telling you what you thought you heard, to take the case directly to the American people.","I've tried in my public life -- like supporting fair housing when I was a Member of Congress from Texas and fighting for I think decent civil rights legislation, whether it's the ADA bill or an antidiscriminatory civil rights bill. I think we got, and others here have mentioned this very generously, an excellent record of appointing officials on the content of their character and their competence to positions of high authority in the Government. I am proud of what both Josh and Lou talked about, to have appointed a higher percentage of blacks and women in the history of the Presidency to important positions.","Some are here with us today: Gwen King at the Social Security Commission, who is now going on to new pursuits. I mentioned Kay James, who served with such distinction in several capacities. Some are nonpolitical. I think it's a wonderful thing that Colin Powell is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I don't know anything about his politics, and I couldn't care less. I know something about his character, though. I know something about his ability, though. I know something of how it is when he's making tough, tough decisions regarding the life of somebody else's son and daughter, and that's all I need to know in selecting the best Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.","Connie Newman, we all know her, how she served with great distinction in this administration; and a most beloved figure, Joyce Berry. I mentioned Lou, of course. I mentioned Josh for the Commission. But we've got others, Carla Hills, Antonia Novello, Lynn Martin, Bernadine Healy, all women in high-level positions. I'm proud of Wayne Budd over at Justice. You talk abut a tough assignment, there's a decent man and a man of honor, fulfilling an extraordinarily tough assignment over at the Department of Justice. My old friend Art Fletcher is head of the Commission.","Let me tell you something: I am not going to let the political diatribes going on out there and attacks coming out of some radical groups diminish the pride I take in having appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. So let others try to smear a decent man. I'm standing with him. He's going to be a great Justice. You watch. You just wait. He's just beginning. He's going to be outstanding.","So we're here to salute all of you -- I came over to do that -- and to thank you, those in Government, for serving and serving with integrity. I'll tell you something: Our administration has been a clean administration. You look back over your shoulders. We haven't had scandals because we have honorable men and women who sacrifice to serve their country. I'm proud of each and every one of you. And in terms of those others who are out in the private sector employing people, creating opportunity, living the American dream, I salute you as well. We want to facilitate what you're doing, not get Government in the way and make it tougher.","So this is the message we'll be taking to the American people, and I believe we're going to get this job done. It has not been a very pleasant political year for Barbara Bush and me; I'll have to confess that. Indeed, I've been around the political track for a long time, and I've never seen quite the anger and the ugliness in the political process, the willingness to twist and distort and make things ugly. But it's worth it; you know it. It is worth it because we have accomplished a lot for this country. We've accomplished a lot on the world scene as well. Now I want to finish the job, finish the job by bringing opportunity and hope to all Americans, and I am very grateful to each and every one of you."]}

Well, chancellor and Coach Fulmer, Tee, Mercedes this is the most disgusting pander I've ever seen. You know, Coach Fulmer came up 48 hours ago, and he and Al practiced all this 15 times. We're going to be cited by the Federal Election Commission for this event.","Let me tell you you know, I'm not running for anything. I can tell you the whole story about this this Tennessee-Arkansas deal. Everything he said is true. And for all of you who are covering this who aren't from one of the two States, let me the game was an unbelievable game, and Arkansas was ahead at the end.","And there was only a minute and a half to go, and we seemed to have an insurmountable lead. And our quarterback was trying to kill the clock, a little of the clock. And the Tennessee line broke through the Arkansas offensive line and tackled him behind the line. And he fell, not with his free hand but with the hand on the ball, which squirted out into the arms of Tennessee. And the rest is history.","Who's responsible for that over there? Raise your hand, there. Give him a hand over there. Bring that guy up here. Get him up here. Come on.","And what you really don't what Al couldn't tell you, because he's not like me; I'm not running for anything is that I was actually watching this game as this foreign policy crisis was unfolding. And I was talking on the phone, injecting things, and they thought, you know, I was being tougher on what was happening on the phone, and I was really just reacting to the ballgame.","But to be fair, to be perfectly fair to Tennessee, I think that you had over 40 yards still to go","Coach Fulmer. Forty-six.","[SPEAKER]. for a touchdown, right? Forty-six. So it wasn't like he fumbled on the goal line. And they rolled down there like there was nobody there. And they won the game, and they went on to the national championship.","And I paid off my bet, and","The Vice President. I'll get you some ribs.","[SPEAKER]. and we've had a lot of laughs about it.","But I do want to say, you know, I was the first President from my home State ever elected. I owe a lot to Tennessee; if it hadn't been for the Vice President joining the ticket, I might not have won the first time, almost certainly wouldn't have won the second time, because we made all the record we made together. And so I feel deeply indebted.","And all I can say is, we're even now.","Actually, I was very impressed. I like teams, and people, who don't quit, who never say die, and who stick together.","I like the fact that this team had a lot of stars, at different times during the year, but won as a team. You had Peerless Price caught a, what, a 76- and a 79-yard touchdown pass in the Fiesta Bowl, but he wouldn't have been there to catch those passes if this guy hadn't broken through the line, somebody else hadn't kicked a field goal, and if all the guys in the line who never get their names called on television didn't show up for every play and play like crazy.","And I think it's important. And I think it's a real tribute to these young men, and to their fine coach. And I think it should be obvious to anybody who knows anything about college football, and anything about this coach, anything about this program, that this is a program, and a team, founded not just on strength and speed and talent but also on thinking and effort and courage and good values.","And in that sense, in winning the national championship and in winning it the way they did, in a highly competitive season, they reflected credit on the entire United States of America.","And every every person in America should be proud of them. I certainly am, and I wish you well in getting back next year.","Thank you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthephilharmonicclubturinitaly","text":["Mr. Mayor, Your Excellency, Fellow Citizens:","You show your welcome in many delightful ways and in no more delightful way than that in which you have shown it in this room. The words which the mayor has uttered have touched me very much and I have been most touched and stimulated by the words which Senor Postorelli has so kindly uttered in behalf of the Government of this great kingdom. It is very delightful to feel my association with that government and with this city. I know how much of the vitality of Italian effort comes out of this great center of industry and of thought. As I passed through your streets I had this sensation, a sensation which I have often had in my own dear country at home—a sensation of friendship and close sympathetic contact. I could have believed myself in an American city. And I felt more than that. I felt, as I have also felt at home, that the real blood of the country flowed there in the street, in the veins of those plain people who more than some of the rest of us have borne the stress and burden of the war.","Because think of the price at which you and at which we have purchased the victory which we have won. Think of the price of blood and treasure not only, but the price of tears, the price of hunger on the part of little children, the hopes delayed, the dismay of the prospects, that bore heavy upon the homes of simple people everywhere. That is the price of liberty. Those of us who plan battles, those of us who conceive policies, do not bear the burden of it. We direct and others execute. We plan and others suffer, and the conquest of spirit is greater than the conquest of arms. These are the people that hold tight. These are the people that never let go and say nothing. They merely live from day to day, determined that the glory of Italy or the glory of the United States shall not depart from her. I have been thinking as I have passed through your streets and sat here that this was the place of the labors of the great Cavour, and I have thought how impossible many of the things that have happened in Italy since, how impossible the great achievements of Italy in the last three years, would have been without the work of Cavour. Ever since I was a boy one of my treasured portraits has been a portrait of Cavour; because I had read about him, of the way in which his mind took in the nation, the national scope of it, of the strong determined patriotic endeavor that never allowed obstacles to dismay him, and of the way he always stood at the side of the King and planned the great things which the King was enabled to accomplish.","And I have another thought. This is a great industrial center. Perhaps you gentlemen think of the members of your Government and the members of the other governments who are going to confer now at Paris as the real makers of war and of peace. We are not. You are the makers of war and of peace. The pulse of the modern world beats on the farm and in the mine and in the factory. The plans of the modern world are made in the counting house. The men who do the business of the world now shape the destinies of the world, and peace or war is in large measure in the hands of those who conduct the commerce of the world. That is one reason why unless we establish friendships, unless we establish sympathies, we clog all the processes of modern life. As I have several times said, you can not trade with a man who does not trust you, and you will not trade with a man whom you do not trust. Trust is the very life and breadth of business; and suspicion, unjust national rivalry stands in the way of trade, stands in the way of industry. A country is owned and dominated by the capital that is invested in it. I do not need to instruct you gentlemen in that fundamental idea. In proportion as foreign capital comes in among you and takes its hold, in that proportion does foreign influence come in and take its hold. And therefore the processes of capital are in a certain sense the processes of conquest.","I have only this to suggest, therefore. We go to Paris to conclude a peace. You stay here to continue it. We start the peace. It is your duty to continue it. We can only make the large conclusions. You constantly transact the details which constitute the processes of the life of nations.","And so it is very delightful to me to stand in this company and feel that we are not foreigners to each other. We think the same thoughts. We entertain the same purposes. We have the same ideals; and this war has done this inestimable service: It has brought nations into close vital contact, so that they feel the pulses that are in each other, so that they know the purposes by which each is animated. We know in America a great deal about Italy, because we have so many Italian fellow citizens. When Baron Soninno was arguing the other day for the extension of the sovereignty of Italy over Italian populations, I said, \"I am sorry we can not let you have New York, which, I understand, is the greatest Italian city in the world.\" I am told that there are more Italians in New York City than in any city in Italy, and I am proud to be [SPEAKER] of a Nation which contains so large an element of the Italian race, because, as a student of literature, I know the genius that has originated in this great nation, the genius of thought and of poetry and of philosophy and of music, and I am happy to be a part of a Nation which is enriched and made better by the introduction of such elements of genius and of inspiration.","May I not again thank the representative of this great city and the representative of the Government for the welcome they have given me, and say again, for I can not say it too often, Viva l'ltalia?"]}

Anyone that hasn't gotten his cuff links or tickets to the Kennedy Center, please see Max Friedersdorf.","Well, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Cabinet and staff and all of you who are here, I don't think the East Room has ever seen exactly this kind of meeting here before. And I think last week we saw an extraordinary example of cooperation between the legislative and executive branches of government, and I want all of you Members of the House to know how deeply grateful I am for what you did last week.","During these past 112 days we've worked well together, and I think we've made a little history. Thanks to you, we've made it clear that spending can be controlled and that our system works. The voice of the people can be heard here in the Capital, and in so doing, we've restored their confidence of our people in their government and in the institutions of this Government. I know that what we did was only the first step, but I have confidence that in the weeks and months ahead we'll continue to put country ahead of partisanship.","Yes, we have a big job ahead of us putting tax cuts into effect that are really the other half of returning America's prosperity. I believe the reduction in the tax rates, as I know I've said to many of you, is essential to restoring the spirit of enterprise.","You know, some years ago there was an economist at Harvard, now deceased, Sumner Schlichter. And he said once that if a visitor from Mars came to Earth, he would conclude that our tax policy had been created to make private enterprise unworkable. And, you know, maybe what he was talking about, sometimes in a business or a sports team or an army, will outperform its competitor even though the material assets of the two seem to be roughly equal.","Now, some academicians have commented-well, they've referred to this as the x factor in human affairs, a confidence or a spirit that makes men and women dream and dare and take greater risks. Well, for too long a time our tax structure has stifled that x factor and that spirit of confidence and daring in our economic doings here in our land. Those who have the means to invest have sought tax shelters instead. And workers have been discouraged from saving or even trying to increase their earnings by increasing their productivity. I think the people have told us they want to see America return to the can-do spirit that made this country an industrial and economic giant.","Would I be wrong in suggesting that all of us here today feel a kind of special closeness? It's a feeling, I think, born of standing together for something we believed in. And I appreciate the courage it took for some of you to take that stand. I hope that we can maintain this bond established so far in the days to come. And again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkstheresignationalanbkruegerchairmanthecouncileconomicadvisersandthe","text":["Good afternoon, all of you. It's now been nearly 5 years since an economic crisis and a punishing recession came together to cost far too many Americans their jobs and their homes and the sense of security that they had built up over time. And by the time I took office, my team and I were facing bubbles that had burst, markets that had cratered, bank after bank on the verge of collapse. And the heartbeat of American manufacturing, our auto industry, was flatlining. And all this meant that hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs each month. So this was a scary time. And nobody had any idea where the bottom would be.","Four and a half years later, our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 36 months. The American auto industry has come roaring back. We're producing more of our own energy; we're consuming less that we import from other countries. Our deficits are shrinking rapidly. The cost of health care is slowing. The housing market is rebounding. People's retirement savings are growing. The wealth that was lost from that recession has now been recovered.","All of this progress is a testament to the grit and resolve of the American people, most of all. But it's also due in some measurable way to the incredible dedication of the men and women who helped to engineer America's response. And two of those people are standing next to me, two very smart economists: Alan Krueger and Jason Furman.","Today I can announce that Alan is heading back to teach his beloved students at Michelle's alma mater, Princeton University. When they get together, all they can talk about is Princeton, and they're all very proud, and those of us who didn't go to Princeton have to put up with it. And I'm proud to say that Jason Furman has agreed to replace Alan as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers.","Now, during the crisis, Alan stepped in initially to help engineer our response as Assistant Secretary and chief economist at the Treasury Department. He was so good that we then had to beg him to come back, extend his tour, to serve as the Chairman of my Council of Economic Advisers, where he's been the driving force behind actions that we've taken to help restart the flow of lending to small businesses and create new jobs and arm workers with the skills they need to fill them, to reduce income inequality, to rebuild our aging infrastructure, and to bring down our deficits in a responsible way.","And Alan is driven by the basic bargain at the heart of our economy: the idea that hard work should be rewarded. He's motivated by the principle that no one who works full time in the greatest nation on Earth should have to raise their families in poverty or below poverty levels. His commitment to a rising, thriving middle class shines through in his often passionate presentations andat least for an economist, they're passionate and in the policies that he's pushed, and I know this will continue to be a focus of his research.","Alan's wife and son are here today, and I know that they're all looking forward to having Alan back. And now that Alan has some free time, he can return to another burning passion of his: \"rockonomics,\" the economics of rock and roll. This is something that Alan actually cares about; seriously, on Wednesday, he's giving a speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's got a T-shirt under his suit with a big tongue sticking out. Don't show it.","So Alan has become one of my most trusted advisers. He's become a wonderful friend. I'm sad to see him go. But I know that he will continue to do outstanding work, and fortunately, he'll still be available for us to consult with him periodically, because he's a constant font of good ideas about how we can further help the American people. So thank you very much, Alan, for all the good work that you've done.","Now, I'm also proud to nominate another outstanding economist to take his place. Jason Furman is one of the most brilliant economic minds of his generation. Don't take my word for it: You can talk to other economists who know a lot more than I do about it. He's won the respect and admiration from his peers across the political spectrum. His Ph.D. thesis adviser, Greg Mankiw, chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. Nobel Prize Winner Joe Stiglitz, on the other side of the economic spectrum, hired Jason to work for the CEA under President Clinton.","After leaving President Clinton's White House, Jason finished his Ph.D. in economics, quickly acquired a reputation as a world-class scholar and researcher. But public service kept calling, and Jason's kept answering that call because he believes deeply in it. So from working at the World Bank on issues of inequality and international finance to developing new proposals to strengthen our health and retirement programs, he helped to shape some of our most important economic policy debates.","And when I asked him to join my team in 2008, even though his baby daughterthat's right you were this big, had just been bornhe agreed to serve once again. And over the last 5 years, I've come to trust not only his head, but also his heart, because Jason never forgets who it is that we're fighting for: middle class families, folks who are working hard to climb their way into the middle class, the next generation.","And when the stakes are highest, there's no one I'd rather turn to for straightforward, unvarnished advice that helps me to do my job. He understands all sides of an argument, not just one side of it. He's worked tirelessly on just about every major economic challenge of the past 4½ years, from averting a second depression to fighting for tax cuts that help millions of working families make ends meet, to creating new incentives for businesses to hire, to reducing our deficits in a balanced way that benefits the middle class.","And so Eve, Jason's wife, who is an accomplished writer herself, has put up with a lot of hours with Jason away. Henry and Louisa, who are here, they've made a lot of sacrifices so that their husband and dad could be here working for the American people. So I appreciate you guys for sharing daddy just a little bit longer. And the reason it's important is because, while we've cleared away the rubble of crisis and laid a new foundation for growth, our work is nowhere near done.","Even though the economy is growing, too many middle class families still feel like they're working harder and harder and can't get ahead. Inequality is still growing in our society. Too many young people aren't sure whether they'll be able to match the living standards of their parents. We have too many kids in poverty in this country still.","There are some basic steps that we can take to strengthen the position of working people in this country, to help our economy grow faster, to make sure that it's more competitive. And some of that requires political will. Some of it requires an abiding passion for making sure everybody in this country has a fair shot. But it also requires good economists. I know it's called a dismal science, but I don't find it that dismal. I think it's actually pretty interesting. Alan and Jason appreciate that. So sometimes, the rest of my staff thinks, oh, Obama is getting together with his economists, and they're going to have a wonkfest for the next hour.","But this stuff matters. It's not just numbers on a page. It makes a difference in terms of whether or not people get a chance at life and also, how do we optimize opportunity and make sure that itwe don't have a contradiction between an efficient, growing, free market economy, and one in which everybody gets a fair shot and where we're caring for the vulnerable and the disabled and folks in our society who need help.","So a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, that rewards hard work and responsibility, that's our north star. Jason shares that focus. I know Alan shares that passion. In Jason's new role as the Chairman of the EconomicCouncil of Economic Advisers, he'll be working with some of our country's leading economists, including Jim Stock, who has joined us. And I'm relying on them to provide analysis and recommendations with just one thing in mind: What's going to do the most good for the most people in this country, not what's best for a political party, not what's best for a special interest. I don't have another election. It's not what's best for mewhat's best for our middle class, and everybody who is working hard to get there. That's what the American people deserve.","So I would urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Jason Furman. And I want to again thank Alan for his outstanding service. I want to thank Jason and his family for continuing to serve the country they love. And for all the economists in the room, thank you for the occasionally underappreciated work that you do.","Thank you."]}

Less than 1 year ago, on April 7, 1965, I asked for the creation of the Asian development plan to seek economic advance and social justice for all of Asia. I pledged the full support of the United States of America to that task.","Today we have begun to redeem that pledge. The act I sign this morning authorizes the United States of America to ratify the charter of the Asian Development Bank.","Seldom have nations joined together in a collective venture that is so endowed with promise. For that reason this moment is a very special one for so many people:","First, for the Asian leaders, who conceived and organized the bank and who are so ably represented here today by the Ambassadors from their countries.","For the people of those non-Asian nations which have signed the charter, and whose Ambassadors have come this morning to bespeak again their vision and their generosity.","For my great friend, a true American, Eugene Black, whose energy and tact have been as indispensable as his experience and wisdom.","And to the Congress of the United States and the members of both parties who have acted to invest in this enterprise not only the resources but the faith of the 190 million people whom they represent.","This act is an economic Magna Carta for the diverse lands of Asia. Its charter links 31 countries in a union against the involuntary economic servitude imposed on the people of Asia by time and circumstance and by neighbor and nature. There is also a deeper meaning. This billion dollar bank is a symbol that the twain have met, not as Kipling predicted, \"at God's great Judgment Seat,\" but at the place of man's shared needs.","It is no longer possible to be a mere observer at that place. It is not possibleand it is not rightto neglect a people's hopes because the ocean is 'vast, or their culture is alien, or their language may be strange, or their race different, or their skin another color.","Asia just must no longer sit at the second table of the 20th century's concern. The economic network of this shrinking globe is too intertwined. The political order of continents is too involved with one another. The threat of common disaster is too real for all human beings to say of Asia, or any other continent, \"Yours . . . is another sphere.\"","I believe that those who make that case are no less patriotic and no less sincere than those who believe that we cannot shorten the length of our reach into the world.","But I believe equally as firmly that those people are wrong. And while I expect they will continue to make their argument of isolationism versus globalismfor we all are determined to preserve their right to speak up in this landI hope they, too, expect me to try to keep on making my case for realism. ","And what is that case? It is simply that there is no rest from the trials of freedom, there is no recalling what the pace of change has done to the map of this big world, there is no reducing our responsibilities while the challenges of progress will not permit us to name the site for our duel or the weapons that we use.","It is that we cannot turn from the place of shared needs and expect either peace or progress to follow us.","So today we have come here to the historic East Room of the White House and gathered at this place to start a journey together.","The Asian Development Bank is the first step of what I conceive to be a very long journey.","We are taking another today by announcing that we have pledged a half of the $24 million that is needed to construct the large Mekong River project, the Nam Ngum tributary project in Laos. Seven other countries, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, Thailand, Denmark, Australia, and New Zealand, are joining us in that effort.","For the United States it is our first major commitment under our promise to expand economic and social development in Southeast Asia. The Nam Ngum project is the Mekong Committee's highest priority undertaking and, like the Asian Development Bank, it represents a major accomplishment in joint cooperation in the world.","The first phase of the project will include a dam and power station with an installed capacity up to 30,000 kilowatts. Additional generators up to 120,000 kilowatts can be installed as they are needed. An international transmission line, with a link across the Mekong River, will connect the power station with the capital of Laos and northeast Thailand.","This is just one example of how the fruits of technologyand the ingenuity of cooperation-can bring new life to whole new regions of the world.","More, yes, much more, awaits our response. Schools and hospitals can be built. Rivers can be tamed. New crops and new breeds of livestock can be developed. There are no bounds to the possibilities, if there are no limits to our dreams.","It has been said that \"no statue was ever erected to the memory of a man or woman who thought it was best to let well enough alone.\"","So it is with the nations that we represent here today. We seek no statues to our memory. We seek only one real monument, a monument with peace and progress for its base and justice for its pinnacle.","Togetheryour lands and minewe will build it.","Thank you very much."]}

Tonight we celebrate the ties that bind us.","Those ties begin with the discoveries of Columbus and Vespucci, whose busts adorn the Blue Room next door. When the Founders created the American Republic, they looked to Rome for inspiration. George Washington was likened to Cincinnatus, the Roman hero who abandoned his plow to rescue his country by popular demand. I might say, they were the last two people to head our countries only by popular demand.","Poets and philosophers of the Roman Republic were read and rejuvenated as our new Republic looked to the past to plan our future. In the writings of ancient Roman thinkers like Cicero and Cato, America's Founders saw the promise of democratic representative government. Every aspect of our new Republic paid tribute to the simple grandeur of Rome: from our architecture to words like \"senate\" and \"capitol.\" Indeed, after our Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked what our Founders had produced. His simple reply was, \"A Republic, sir, if you can keep it.\"","Towns sprang up with the names from the ancient Mediterranean world, names like Utica, Troy, or the Vice President's hometown, Carthage. Artists portrayed America's leaders wearing togas, as the bust of George Washington in the hall demonstrates. Thankfully, that is a tradition we have left to the 19th century. ","In the 19th and 20th centuries, our Republic turned into a bustling nation, thanks in no small measure to Italian-Americans. Ancient Rome was replaced by young Italy in the American imagination. And democracy was given new life by heroes like Mazzini and Garibaldi.","America's growing cities attracted millions of Italians, eager to build a new life in a new world. They worked hard. They prospered. Today American Italians, or Italian-Americans, are leaders in every enterprise conducted in our Nation. And as we all know, it is impossible to walk more than a few blocks in any American city without hearing the words \"caffe latte.\" ","The people here in this room tonight are the link between our two countries, between two cultures that have nourished each other since America was just an idea. From our highest courts to our finest tables, from our playing fields to our silver screen, from one side of the aisle in Congress to the other, Italian-Americans have graced our Nation with their intellect, their industry, their good will, and above all, a contagious love of life.","Mr. Prime Minister, you have accomplished so much in your time in office. You have presided over a string of economic successes. And Americans especially admire your perseverance in leading Italy toward European monetary union. Without Italy, Europe is not Europe. And without Europe, the world would be a poorer, less free, and much duller place.","Italy has been a force for peace and security in its region, on the Continent, around the world, in Albania, in Bosnia, and in Kosovo, where we're working hard together to bring about a peaceful resolution. America is proud to know you as a partner and an ally, and we are grateful for your provision of our military bases, sent to help maintain Europe's hard-won peace.","Mr. Prime Minister, we take pride in our strong friendship. We know it will continue to grow stronger as we enter the new millennium, a word that brings us, once again, back to Rome. For just as the Pax Romana spread far and wide through the ancient world, we hope and work for the peace of a new millennium that will allow more people than ever before to live their dreams in security.","If we can achieve a peace of the millennium, then the ancient dream of Columbus to explore new places can be lived by more people than ever—new places in outer space, in biotechnology and medical research, in the hearts and minds of people around the world who still look to Italy and America for confirmation that a good society can be created from many parts.","E pluribus unum, the motto of the United States, a principle cherished by Italians and Americans: Out of many, one. Mr. Prime Minister, let us make it so.","Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister and Mrs. Prodi and the people of Italy."]}

We are honored here in the White House to be joined today by distinguished Members of the Senate and the House: Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Sarbanes, one of Janet Reno's Senators, Senator Connie Mack. Senator Graham called me last night. He's in Florida today with the First Lady at a health care hearing. And he said he had an excused absence from the Attorney General.","The [SPEAKER] and Congressman Edwards are here, and we're delighted to see all of them. I also would say we're delighted to be joined by Mr. Justice White and Mrs. White. Thank you very much for coming. Let me say that it is a great honor for me to be able to be here at this ceremony today with Janet Reno, her family, and a few of her many friends.","I'd like to say a special word of thanks to Stuart Gerson, who has served ably and honorably as Acting Attorney General since the Inauguration. I think we owe him a round of applause. [Applause]","Somehow I don't think any of my other proposals will pass the Senate by the same vote margin— —that Janet's confirmation did. I especially want to thank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch and the members of the Judiciary Committee for waiving the normal waiting period between hearings and the confirmation vote, making this event possible today and making it possible for us to proceed immediately with the urgent tasks at hand.","But more than anything else, I think it is clear that Janet Reno made her own swift confirmation possible, showing the Senate and all who followed the hearings the qualities of leadership and integrity, intelligence, and humanity that those gathered in this room have recognized for a very long time.","You shared with us the life-shaping stories of your family and career that formed your deep sense of fairness and your unwavering drive to help others to do better. You showed us that your career in public service, working on the front lines in your community, fighting crime, understanding the impact on victims and on neighborhoods, mending the gritty social fabric of a vibrant but troubled urban area, is excellent preparation for carrying forward the banner of justice for all the American people.","You'll help to guide the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement in ways that really count. You demonstrated that you will be a formidable advocate for the vulnerable people in our society and especially for our children.","Most of all, you proved to the Nation that you are a strong and an independent person who will give me your best legal judgment whether or not it's what I want to hear. It's an experience I've already had, I'm glad to say. That is the condition upon which you accepted my nomination and the only kind of Attorney General that I would want serving in this Cabinet.","As Janet Reno begins her work at the Justice Department, she will enter a building that symbolizes our Nation's commitment to justice, to equality, to the enforcement of our laws. On the side of that building, carved above one of the portals, is the inscription, \"The halls of justice are a hallowed place.\" With Janet Reno serving as our Nation's Attorney General, those words will have great meaning for all Americans."]}

Well, I was just sitting here thinking two things. First, when the Vice President got really warmed up— [laughter]—I thought to myself, first, it will become slightly obvious to this audience that he and I come from a little further south in the United States. [Laughter] And then I was thinking, when he really got going, I wish I had people walking the aisles passing the plate. It was amazing. [Laughter]","Anyway, the second thing I thought in the midst of this wonderful event was that I wish that I could take the Pep Band with me for the next month or two wherever I go. [Applause] Thank you.","Audience members. We love you, Bill!","[SPEAKER]. Thank you. I want to say to Chancellor Aiken and President Stukel and Mayor McCollum, Mayor Satterthwaite, Congressman Ewing, Senator Durbin, and Senator Moseley-Braun, Secretary Riley, and Mr. Vice President, I am delighted to be here. I have spent a lot of time in Illinois in the last 7 years, and this State has been very good to me in many ways. The Vice President has been here a lot, and Hillary came and got a honorary degree and was able to speak here. And I have heard from also our families, friends what a wonderful place this is. I don't know how, with all my roaming across America, I have never lit down here before, but I'm sure glad I got here today. And I thank you for making me feel so welcome.","If you heard the State of the Union last night or just listened to the Vice President here today you know that—you know there's a reason we're here, because you represent, both all of you individually and this great institution, what we're trying to build for the future of America. Last night I talked about all the changes that have occurred just in the last few years. We've had one foot in the 21st century for quite some time. The generation living today has lived through more changes in more different areas in a shorter time than virtually any generation in the history of this country.","And when the Vice President and I took office, we were committed to trying to make America work again, to try to fix the things that just weren't working for ordinary people, and then to free us up to sort of imagine the future and take the steps that were necessary to get us to the future we want to build. That's really what I talked about last night: How can we strengthen this country for the 21st century? What do we have to do?","Now, I don't want to go over everything that was said, and besides that, I can't do as well as the Vice President. He must have gotten 30 more minutes sleep than I did last night. [Laughter] He was terrific. But I want to talk to you about just two or three things that I think we should be thinking about for tomorrow.","Let me begin with a bit of history, and your chancellor mentioned it earlier, or [SPEAKER] did. Shortly before—shortly after Abraham Lincoln was elected President, Congressman Justin Morrill, from Vermont, asked his colleagues to help him create a system of land grant colleges. It was in the middle of the Civil War, and frankly, most of them thought he was nuts. You know, people were worried about the survival of the Union. But Abraham Lincoln was always worrying about other things, even in the middle of the Civil War.","At night, when I work in the White House, I go to an office that I've had restored to the way it was in the mid-1800's. And I remember that that room was Abraham Lincoln's waiting room during the Civil War. And all during the Civil War, at certain appointed hours, he kept a time apart to meet with ordinary citizens. If you wanted a job in a post office in Baltimore in 1862, if you came at the appointed day, at the appointed hour, you could walk up to the room that I go into every night, and sit there, and Abraham Lincoln would see you; [SPEAKER] would see you and listen to you tell why you wanted a post office job. And when he was asked why he did this, he said, \"I have to remember that people are concerned about other things, and I want this war to be over so all of us can go back to thinking about things like that.\"","So he always thought about what life would be like when the war was over. And he was open to this. In 1862, Morrill's bill passed, and President Lincoln signed it into law. It became one of the wisest investments our Nation ever made, and the University of Illinois, here, was one of the original land grant colleges under that Morrill Act.","It's played a dramatic role in helping to shape our Nation. You heard and you were cheering about all the Nobel Prize winners and all that. The Vice President pointed out that it was here that the transistor was invented; Jack Kilby, class of '47, co-invented the microchip. NCSA, headed by Larry Smarr, launched a billion-dollar browser industry. Illinois and other land grant colleges have literally led our way into the information age.","And it all stemmed from something somebody did in 1862 that no one could have imagined would one day have led to all you see around you. I think Lincoln would have liked the Pep Band. [Laughter] But he could not have imagined it.","So that's what we've been trying to do. And you heard the Vice President say that basically our view was—the first thing we had to do was we had to get rid of the deficit, but we had to do it in a way that would enable us to invest in our future. We had to shrink the Government, but we had to do it in a way that would allow us to be more active in the areas that were important to our future, that would help to bring us together and widen the circle of opportunity. And the strategy is working.","Now, as you look ahead, I'd just like to mention three things today that I think the University can have a major impact on, two directly and one indirectly. First, we should look to the millennium to try to speed the pace of scientific and technological advances in ways that benefit all of us. So I proposed last night a huge increase in medical research, an increase in the National Science Foundation, a doubling of the National Cancer Institute, because I believe we have enormous opportunities there, and you should be a part of that.","I think it is highly likely that many of you who will be having children in the next 3 or 4 years will have children that will live into the 22d century because of the work that will be done in places like the University of Illinois.","The second thing that I think we should think about is we should reaffirm our commitment to the exploration of outer space. I talked a little about the international space station last night and about Senator John Glenn at 77 years old going back into space. It's so thrilling, and I know all of you are happy about that. But we are learning a lot from our work in space about how our bodies work here on Earth and about how our environment works here on Earth and how it might be better preserved. And so I ask all of you to continue to support the work we're doing there.","And finally, I'd ask you to support, as the Vice President said, this next generation Internet. I mean, can you really believe that only 5 years ago there were just 50 webpages on the Internet; that the Internet was the private preserve of physicists 5 years ago, and now, most 8-year-olds know more about it than their parents? [Laughter] I mean, that gives you some sense of the speed of change.","So we're trying to develop the next generation Internet, and Larry Smarr is helping us, and if it works, it will work about 1,000 times faster than the present one does. I don't know how we can absorb any more speed in information, but we have to be able to. We have to maintain public support across party lines and regional lines and age lines and race lines and all kinds of lines for investments in the future. We always have to be trying to shape the future, and we need your help to do that.","Now, the second thing that I want to emphasize is that I want all of you to support the proposition that we have to make, in the years ahead, a college education as universal as a high school education is today. Now, why do I say that? Already it is perfectly clear from looking at all the census figures that any young person who has at least 2 years of college or more is highly likely to get a job with growing income prospects and high stability and the prospect of positive change in the future. Now, a young person with less than 2 years of college is highly likely to be in a job where income increases don't keep up with inflation, subject to changes which may be unstable and not positive.","We have to create a network of lifetime learning. We have to, first of all, make our elementary and secondary education as excellent as our higher education is today so more people will be prepared to go to college. But then we literally—we've got to make sure that college is open to all.","Now, as the Congressman said, 1997 was the best year for education in a generation, and I believe, clearly, the best year since the GI bill was passed. If you listen to all the things that were done—and I'll just litanize them for you—I think you can make a compelling case that the doors of college have been opened to everybody who will work for it. Now, listen to this: 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships and the maximum amount increased; 300,000 new work-study positions; 50,000 AmeriCorps slots for people who do community service work and earn money to go to college. As Senator Moseley-Braun said, she cosponsored the bill to make interest on student loans tax deductible again; there are IRA's now that you can invest in and then withdraw from, tax-free, if the money is used for education. The first 2 years of college, virtually all Americans are eligible for a $1,500 tax cut to pay for tuition in the first 2 years of college, the HOPE scholarship; and then another tax credit for the 3d and 4th years of college, for graduate school, and for further job training—a lifetime learning credit.","Now, this is an amazing thing. But what I want to say to you is, all of you who are here, I came here to ask, as a great university, in whatever service groups you're in, in whatever family or neighborhood or church networks you have, you need to get this message out to people who are coming on behind you. We need every child in this country to know that if he or she works hard and learns what they're supposed to learn, they can all go to college now. And we need them there for our future in the 21st century.","Now, the last thing I want to ask your help on in the coming year, because we're going to have a big dialog about it, is something that all of you students probably never think about, and that is Social Security and your retirement. I don't know about you, but when I was your age, I never thought about it. [Laughter] I thought I would live forever, always young. And what Senator Moseley-Braun said is true: The older you get, the faster time goes.","I never will forget, once, a few years ago, I saw a man who was 76 years old at an airport meeting his brother, getting ready to go to his sister's funeral. And I said, \"What are you thinking about?\" And he said, \"Oh, I'm thinking about when we were 5 years old, how we used to play together.\" He said, \"You know, Bill, it doesn't take long to live a life.\" I say that to say that even the young must care for the future, even the young must think about their obligations to generations yet unborn; that America must work as a seamless web of community, always doing what is best for today and tomorrow.","Now, what's that got to do with Social Security? There are polls that say that young people in their twenties think it's more likely that they will see UFO's than that they will ever collect Social Security. [Laughter] And all of you know that the Social Security system is supposed to be in trouble. Now, what does that mean? It is not in trouble today; nobody today has got any problems drawing their money. In fact, today we collect more money in Social Security taxes every year, quite a bit more, than we pay out.","The problem is that when the baby boomers retire—starting with me, I'm the oldest of the baby boomers—people my age and down about 18 years younger, we are the largest group of Americans that have ever lived, except the group that started first grade last year—second grade, or third grade, whatever it is, something in grade school—because we've got more children in schools now, public schools, than we had during the baby boom generation for the first time. But we're going to have 18, 20, 25 years where there will be a huge number of people on Social Security in their retirement years, compared to the people who are paying in. That is the issue.","Now, the question is, what is the best way to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers in ways that do not either rob those people who need it of their secure retirement or impose intolerable burdens on our children, who, in turn, will be burdened in raising our grandchildren?","I don't know anybody in my generation who believes that we ought to just take it out on you and put our feet up when we turn 65 and turn away from the obligations we have to contribute to the further growth and vitality of people who are younger than we are. So the question is, what is the fairest way to change this? What's best for people who are on Social Security now? What's best for the baby boomers? What's best for young people in their twenties and thirties just starting to pay into the system? What's best for the kids that are in high school now who haven't even started?","We're going to spend a year having forums all across the country, completely nonpartisan, trying to bring people in and debate it. And then about a year from now, I'm going to convene the leaders of Congress, and we're going to try to craft historic bipartisan legislation to reform Social Security, to save it for the 21st century, to make sure it's there not just for the baby boomers but for everybody in this audience and all your children, too, so we'll have a system that works, so that people who work hard and do their part will know they'll have elemental retirement security and that we can do it without bankrupting the country. I think we can do it. I know we can do it. But it's going to take your good-faith involvement—people of all ages.","And since what we do may affect how you proceed throughout your entire worklife, we've got to have people involved in their twenties, in their thirties. The young people of this country have got to be involved in this debate. It will affect you as much as anybody else.","But if we do it, it will be just sort of like balancing the budget. You know how people said, \"Oh, you'll never get that budget balanced. You'll never do that. That's just something politicians talk about. It is a huge thing to do.\" Why? We spend less money on debt; we invest more money in our future; we have a stronger economy. The same thing will be true of Social Security. Once we make the adjustments necessary to fix it, the increase in confidence, the increase in savings, the increase in belief in the future of this country as we go forward together will be absolutely astonishing. And we need you to be a part of it.","The last thing I want to ask about—the Vice President touched this briefly, and he knows more about it than I do—but we need young people in this country, particularly young people in our university system, to convince the rest of America that we must and we can address the challenge of climate change and global warming.","Now, I can tell you, I have been working on the economics of energy efficiencies for over 20 years now in various guises. I am convinced that the technology is out there right now to do what we need to do to do our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in factories, in power generation systems, in homes and office buildings. And we're getting very, very close in automobiles. We can get there.","But listen, this is your future; this is your life; this is the world your children and your grandchildren will have to live in, in the 21st century. This is crazy for us not to do this. We do not have to take the economy down; we will lift the economy up. And you have to take the lead in helping us meet this challenge.","Scientific research, universal access to university education, reforming Social Security for the 21st century, dealing with the challenge of climate change: those are just four of the things that are out there. Keep your eyes on the future. Believe in this country. Believe in yourself. Reach out across the lines that divide us. Do not let people—do not ever let people who are divisive or pessimistic convince you that there is anything this country can't do. I can look at you and tell you that this country can do anything we put our minds to.","Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you."]}

Distinguished Members of the Congress, Secretary Middendorf, Admiral Holloway, Admiral Cousins, Captain Compton, Mrs. Lay, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:","At the outset, let me thank the Secretary of Defense for his more than generous comments, and let me simply reiterate the theme that he set forth. We are strong, we will continue to be strong, we will keep our commitments, and we will remain a great country.","As each of us looks upon this great ship, a single thought must seize our minds: Only the United States of America can make a machine like this. There is nothing like her in the world today. We have witnessed the magic moment when an intricate mass of steel and cable and sophisticated marvels of engineering suddenly become a living thing with a unique personality.","No matter how many commissionings you take part in, breaking the pennant and setting the first watch involves a special reward for all of us who love the sea and the United States Navy. I thank you very much, Captain Compton, and all of the ship's company for the privilege of being here.","The Nimitz is now a United States Ship. I congratulate all who helped build her and all who man her, as well as their loved ones who-as many of you know better than I will do a lot of waiting for the sake of our country and of freedom everywhere. Their allegiance and their service to the country is also in the very best tradition of this great Nation.","We all regret that Mrs. Chester W. Nimitz, St., cannot share this proud hour with all of us, but I am happy that Mrs. Lay and other members of the admiral's family are here. It is also gratifying to have Admiral Rickover here, for without these two farsighted submariners, Fleet Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Rickover, we would have no nuclear Navy.","Few of us remember that it was Admiral Nimitz, as he was completing his career as Chief of Naval Operations in 1947, who recommended to the then Secretary of the Navy that the Bureau of Ships and the new Atomic Energy Commission get together to design and to build a nuclear propulsion plant for a submarine. Admiral Rickover took it from there.","I see this great ship as a double symbol of today's challenging times. She is first of all a symbol of the United States, of our immense resources in materials and skilled manpower, of our inexhaustible energy, of the inventive and productive genius of our free, competitive economic system, and of our massive but controlled military strength.","Wherever the United States Ship Nimitz shows her flag, she will be seen as we see her now, a solid symbol of United States strength, United States resolve made in America and manned by Americans. She is a movable part and parcel of our country, a self-contained city at sea plying the international waters of the world in defense of our national interests. Whether her mission is one of defense, diplomacy, or humanity, the Nimitz will command awe and admiration from some, caution and circumspection from others, and respect from all.","There is no need for me to dwell on the importance of aircraft carriers in today's and tomorrow's defense planning though as an old carrier man myself, I might like that role. During recent days, I think it is worthy to note, we have seen the most convincing demonstration of their readiness and their flexibility in the successful execution of national policy.","Without the five aircraft carriers which served as the nucleus of our forces operating off South Vietnam, without the skill and the heroic performance of Marine Corps and naval aviation and support personnel, without the Air Force helicopter crews who operated from the carrier decks, we could not have rescued all of the remaining American citizens and thousands of endangered Vietnamese from Saigon within 20 hours. And I congratulate, on behalf of all of you, the work that was done on that occasion.","The Nimitz joins the fleet at an auspicious moment when our determination to strengthen our tics with allies across both great oceans and to work for peace and stability around the world requires clear demonstration. Along with our other forces worldwide, the Nimitz will make critically important contributions in our continuing quest for a peaceful planet, a planet whose surface is more than 70 percent ocean.","As I see the United States Ship Nimitz as a symbol of the vast power, the protective or productive skill and economic strength of America, so will others around the world. To all, this great ship is visible evidence of our commitment to friends and allies and our capability to maintain those commitments. But for Americans, especially, she is also a symbol of the man whose name she bears.","The grandson of a seafaring German immigrant, who grew up in the great State of Texas and never lost his pride in his native State, Chester W. Nimitz started from the smoke of Pearl Harbor and carried the fight to the enemy. His superb leadership and the valor of more than 2 million American fighting men culminated on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri 4 years later, as he signed the Japanese surrender as commander in chief of the largest naval armada ever assembled.","Looking back on a period of my own life, one of the things of which I am the proudest is that I can say, \"I served under Admiral Nimitz in the Pacific.\"","As a lowly lieutenant on the U.S.S. Monterey, a carrier you could probably stow on the hangar deck of the Nimitz, I saw very little of fleet admirals during World War II. But every watch officer could recognize the crisp CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific] dispatches that Admiral Nimitz obviously had written in his own hand.","One biographer who did not know him or who, I should say, did know him Professor E. B. Potter of the Naval Academy, summed up Admiral Nimitz' qualities in simple words that well serve as a model for anyone who aspires to leadership in any line of endeavor. And I quote from Professor Potter: \"He surrounded himself with the ablest men he could find and sought their advice, but he made his own decisions. He was a keen strategist who never forgot that he was dealing with human beings, on both sides of the conflict. He was aggressive in war without hate, audacious while never failing to weigh the risks.\"","Admiral Nimitz, of all the great American commanders of World War II, was one of the most self-effacing and, certainly, one of the most effective. He possessed great stamina, an abundance of common sense, and such immense inner strength that he felt no need to strut or to shout.","Born near what today we would call the poverty level, he worked hard, he studied hard, and was a long, long time getting ahead. He spent his whole life training to serve his country in commanding men at sea, and when he was needed, he was prepared. He learned by his mistakes and was tolerant of others, but he was always in command.","Those who had the good fortune to know Admiral Nimitz will say his fundamental honesty, intellectual honesty and integrity, enabled him to keep a steady course toward his ultimate objective without yielding to the tremendous pressures of his vast responsibilities. He did the job he was prepared to do, did it superbly, hung up his sword and filled his final years with quiet service to his country and to the cause of peace.","Repeatedly urged to write his wartime memoirs, Admiral Nimitz just as repeatedly refused. To do so, he explained, would compel him either to hurt the reputations of some fine shipmates or tell some whopping lies.","His own philosophy, in his own words, has long been a personal inspiration to me. Typically, he credited it to his seafaring grandfather. \"The sea, like life itself is a stern taskmaster,\" he recalled. \"The best way to get along with either is to learn all you can, then do your best, and don't worry especially about things over which you have no control.\"","So, this great ship is a symbol of a great sea commander and a great American, one whose common virtues magnified by the stern demands of duty turned defeat into victory and made the broad Pacific again worthy of its name.","It is my determination to keep it that way, the way all oceans and all continents ought to be. But Fleet Admiral Nimitz and this fine ship both tell us that controlled strength is the sure guarantor of peace. Let us all and particularly those who serve in the United States Ship Nimitz, now and hereafter-rededicate ourselves to this principle and to unstinting service to our country and to its people. Good afternoon, and Godspeed."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthewhitehousestrategysessionimprovinghispanicstudentachievement","text":["Thank you very much, and good afternoon. I have received a good report on what you have done so far, and I want to get right into our program, but I would like to make a few remarks first. I'd like to thank Governor Glendening and Senator Bingaman and Congressman Hinojosa and Guillermo Linares and Secretary Riley for joining us, along with our other panel members.","And I'd like to thank Congressman Joe Baca, Carlos Romero-Barcelo´ for being here. I think Congressman Reyes from Texas is on the way. And I want to welcome Mayor Beverly O'Neill from Long Beach, and especially Lieutenant Governor of California Cruz Bustamante, who is here. And I'd like to thank Maria Echaveste and Mickey Ibarra from the White House for the work they have done on this, along with all the others who have worked so hard.","This is very important to me. One of the things that I have learned traveling America is just how diverse Hispanic America is, something that a lot of Americans don't really know yet. I think there is a common core of values around family and community and work and faith, but Hispanic America is growing more diverse every day with different challenges and, unfortunately, still different opportunities. There are still a lot of gaps that we all want to close. Most of them are narrowing, but we've still got a lot of work to do.","Last August the First Lady hosted the firstever White House Conference on Hispanic Children and Youth. And today we're following up on that Conference by setting forth specific goals and an agenda for closing the student achievement gap over the next 10 years in ways that we can all be held accountable for.","The first step to closing that gap is to believe, as I do, that high expectations are for all students. I believe intelligence is equally distributed throughout the world, but opportunity is not. And the same is true within our own country.","For over 7 years now, we've pushed hard for higher standards, for more choice, for greater accountability, and for more support for children and teachers and parents and schools who need it. We have hired nearly 30,000 new, highly trained teachers now, on the way to our goal of 100,000 more teachers to lower class sizes in the early grades. We've connected about three-quarters of our classrooms to the Internet; that's up from 3 percent in 1994, when we started in northern California, the Vice President and I did, with our first NetDay.","We've made it possible for over 90 percent of our schools in very low income areas to have at least one Internet connection because of the E-rate program that the Vice President and I fought very hard for in the Telecommunications Act in 1996. And we have more than doubled college aid in the last 7 years, the biggest expansion since the GI bill 50 years ago. In all these areas, I actually believe we have more to do.","We also, as all of you know, put in place a Hispanic Education Action Plan that includes, this year, a $436 million increase for programs to improve Latino student outcomes. And I want to double that investment. This strategy of investing more and demanding more is working. Test scores are up across the country; more students than ever are going to college. If we just keep it up, we'll really take this country and all its children where we want to go.","Unfortunately, that progress is threatened by the education bill that the House Committee passed yesterday or that the House passed yesterday. I think it demands too little accountability, and I know it puts in too few resources. It, in my judgment, underinvests in everything from after-school programs, which we have taken from $1 million to over $400 million in just 3 1/2 years. And if that bill were to come to my desk, I would have to veto it. But I hope we can work with Congress on a bipartisan education bill. We've had some success in recent years, and I am confident we will this year.","I'd like to talk just a moment about what many of you already know, which is that Hispanic students are sharing in this academic success, but still too many are lagging behind in ways that I find deeply troubling.","Today I'm releasing a study by my Council of Economic Advisers, which shows that the average educational level of native-born Hispanics has increased substantially over the last several decades, and the gap between Hispanics and whites has declined. Compared to 1993, Hispanic students are scoring higher on math tests; greater percentages are completing high school, graduating from college, and getting advanced degrees.","However, there's some bad news in this report, because the need for education is growing even faster. For example, since 1993, the percentage of Hispanics with 4 or more years of college has increased but only by about 2 percent. Over the next decade, the number of jobs requiring at least 4 years of college will more than double.","The study shows that Hispanics, who represent 11 percent of our work force, hold down just 4 percent of the jobs in information technology, jobs that pay much more than average in the area where jobs are growing most rapidly. Every American should be concerned about that gap. When the fastest growing demographic group in our country is underrepresented in the fastest growing employment sector, it means less opportunity and a violation of the values that we all share. It also means that, sooner or later, our economy will have a shortage of highly skilled workers where we really need them.","One other finding in the report bears mentioning because it will inform the debate we're going to have today. The problem is not that Hispanics are not choosing careers in key industries like information technology. In fact, according to the report, Hispanics who graduate from college enter the information technology industry at about the same rate as non-Hispanics and earn about as much. The problem, therefore, quite simply, is that not enough Hispanics are getting college degrees. That can be remedied only by raising the educational achievements of Hispanic students in schools, beginning in preschool years, continuing into adulthood, and by making sure that no person is ever denied access to college because of cost.","We know that the achievement levels can be raised. The question is whether we have the will to do what we know works. If we're going to set high expectations of students, we must have high expectations of ourselves to do what it takes to make sure all of our students can make the grade.","We know that we can make college more accessible. That's what the HOPE scholarships do, the Direct Student Loan Program, the lifetime learning tax credit. But I think we ought to do more. I have got a proposal before Congress to give up to $10,000 of tuition tax-deductible status every year and to do it at a 28 percent income tax rate, even for people in the 15 percent income tax bracket, which is a very, very important proposal. And it could make it possible for even more of our young people to go to college and for more of our families to afford it.","So today, we know what we have to do, and we know we can do it. And what I think is always helpful is to translate what we wish to do into specific goals. So I think we ought to adopt five specific goals to close the Hispanic student achievement gap over the next 10 years.","First, let's make sure that in 10 years, young Latino children are enrolled in quality early childhood programs at the same rate as other Americans. Second, let's make sure that in 10 years, every Hispanic student graduating from high school will have demonstrable proficiency in English. Third, let's make sure that in 10 years, there is no gap in test scores and other assessments between Hispanic students and their peers. Fourth, let's make sure in 10 years, 90 percent of Latino students complete high school. And fifth, let's make sure that over the next decade, the percentage of Hispanic students who earn college degrees will double what it is today.","Now, these goals are specific and ambitious but clearly achievable. If we are serious, we have to do something about meeting them. This morning the Secretary of Education released the first of what will be annual reports measuring progress in Hispanic student achievement. We also need an entity outside electoral politics to keep a national spotlight on these goals, because they should be the Nation's goals, without regard to party.","Today I'm happy to announce the creation of such an entity: the 2010 Alliance, a partnership among a wide variety of Hispanic organizations, including La Raza and the National Association for Bilingual Education, and corporate and non-profit groups, from the Ford, Irvine, Kellogg, and Hazen Foundations to AT&T, GM, Univision, and State Farm.","The alliance will be, as they say, in your face. [Laughter] It is designed to remind the Nation of these goals and to spur commitments, specific ones, at every level of government and the private sector to help to meet them. I'm happy that a number of organizations have already committed to taking specific steps to help achieve the goals.","The Discovery Channel will publicize the goals in public service announcements to run on its Discovery and Espanol Network. The educational software firm Lightspan is teaming up with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide special software and Internet access for computers in HUD neighborhood centers in Hispanic communities. Many other organizations, from the American Library Association to the Hispanic Radio Network, also are contributing.","Closing this achievement gap is a challenge that may seem daunting now, but it will seem inevitable once we do it. And when we do it, if we work hard, stay together, and stay focused on the goal, America will be a better, stronger place in the 21st century.","Thank you very much.","I'd like now to introduce Governor Parris Glendening of Maryland, who increased his State's investment in education by $600 million and doubled funds to build and modernize schools in his first term in office. In more ways than I can count right now, since he's been Governor, Maryland has been on the forefront of change in our Nation. And I wish every State would follow Maryland's lead."," "]}

It is good to be here. It is good to be here. Although I was hoping that the Governor was going to take a little longer on his remarks, because I was standing outside soaking in some rays. Nothing like California weather.","I am greatly honored to be joined here by one of the great innovators of State government, somebody who has been leading California through some very difficult times, and somebody who has turned out to be just an outstanding partner with our administration. I'm grateful for him; I'm grateful for the first lady of California. Please give it up for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver. Thank you.","Another outstanding public official, somebody who is fighting every day on behalf of the working people of Los Angeles and has a vision for the future for this great city, please give a huge round of applause to your mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. Somebody who's always been ahead of his time and has covered the waterfront in public service and has excelled in each thing that he's done, please, a big round of applause for your attorney general, Jerry Brown.","Some other friends who are here, State Auditor Elaine Howle where's Elaine? Right here. Speaker of the Assembly, a great supporter of Obama from the start, Karen Bass; Senate President pro tem Darrell Steinberg is here. State Senator Gil Cedillo is here. Assemblyman John Perez is here. Your two wonderful United States Senators are not here, but I want you to applaud them anyway, because they work for us each and every day, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard is not here, but she is your Congresswoman, so give her a big round of applause. And last person I want to mention well, two other people I want to mention I believe that my Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis, is here in the house.","I also want to make this point. We are in a facility named after one of the finest labor leaders in this region's history and in this country's history, Miguel Contreras. And Miguel's widow is a great friend of mine, a great supporter, a great labor leader in her own right. Please give it up for Maria Elena Durazo. Maria Elena was one of our earliest supporters at a time when nobody gave us a chance. She said, \"Si se puede.\" We could do it. And we're grateful to her. Thank you so much.","It's always nice to get out of Washington at least for a little bit and to come to places like this. The climate is nicer. So is the conversation sometimes. So I am looking forward to taking your questions and hearing about your concerns. And I look forward to telling you about the work my administration is doing to address some of those concerns.","But the one thing I don't need to tell you is that these are challenging times. I don't need to tell you this because you're living it every day. Between December of last year and January of this year, this State lost more than half a million jobs; 1 out of every 10 Californians is now out of work. Housing prices here have fallen 20 percent in the past year, and you've got one of the highest foreclosure rates in the Nation.","So your public servants are working double overtime to address these critical issues. And I know how tough times are in Los Angeles, in California, but also all across the country. Here's what I want you to remember, though: We are going to meet these challenges; we will come out on the other side stronger and a more prosperous nation. That I can guarantee you. I can't tell you how long it will take, what obstacles we'll face along the way, but I promise you this: There will be brighter days ahead.","Because of the Recovery Act that I signed into law last month and that your two outstanding Senators, Feinstein and Boxer, worked so hard to pass we're making major investments to create jobs right here in California rebuilding infrastructure, weatherizing homes, and putting more police on the streets, supporting community health centers. Altogether, we expect to create or save more than 396,000 jobs in this State over the next 2 years.","But we also know that we can't create as many jobs as we want or rebuild our economy the way we hope without addressing the problem at the heart of this economic crisis, and that's our housing crisis. We know that fixing that crisis, breaking that cycle of falling home values and rising foreclosures, is one of the keys to fixing our economy.","And that's why we've launched a housing plan that will help millions of responsible homeowners save money by refinancing or modifying their mortgages. Our plan included important steps to help lower interest rates. And today, millions of Americans, people who never thought they'd be able to lower their monthly payments, are now able to take advantage of these rates, which are the lowest that they have been in decades.","Already, we're seeing a burst of refinancing. Refinancing applications jumped 30 percent last week to more than double the rate we had last fall, saving the average homeowner hundreds of dollars a month, the equivalent of a generous tax cut. That's money in their pocket, money you can use right now to pay your bills or pay off your debts or save up for a rainy day, to save for retirement or that college education for your child.","And today we launched a new web site called makinghomeaffordable.gov, to help borrowers determine whether they're eligible for our plan and to help them calculate how much money the plan could save them on their mortgage, on their monthly payments.","And keep in mind, this is in addition to the $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers that's in our recovery plan. And if you buy your home your first home any time between now and December 1st, you can claim that credit this year, on your 2008 tax return, and receive that money in as little as 10 days. So if you haven't filed your taxes yet, but you're thinking about buying a house you can request a 6-month extension until October 15th and claim the credit before then. Or if you've already filed your taxes or you wish to do so before April 15th, you can just amend your form later this year after you've bought your home and get your money then.","Look, the idea here is very simple: If you buy a home this year, you should be able to get your tax credit this year. That's when you need it most. That's how we'll help people start spending again. That's how we'll help raise home values, stabilize our housing market, create new jobs again. That's our plan. That's what we're going to do right here in California.","Now, I'm also pleased to announce that today California will be receiving $145 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide additional help to communities hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. So these funds will be used to buy up and rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed homes and resell those homes with affordable mortgages and to provide mortgage assistance and rehabilitation loans for low-income and middle-income families. That's how we'll help people here in California live their dream of homeownership and how we'll start transforming abandoned streets lined with empty houses back into thriving neighborhoods.","Now, we know that it's not enough to address challenges like housing and infrastructure and job creation just in the short term. None of this will make a difference unless we build an economy that offers prosperity in the long run. We can't go back to a bubble-and-burst economy based on reckless speculation and spending beyond our means, where a relative few do spectacularly well while the middle class loses ground. We can't go back to a culture on Wall Street that says it's okay to bend or break the rules and a culture in Washington that says it's okay to look the other way. We can't go back to that.","We can't allow what happened at AIG to ever happen again in this country. I know a lot of people are outraged about this; I'm outraged too. The idea that some of the very people who drove our economy into the ground could accept bonuses with one hand while they're taking taxpayer money with the other goes against our most basic sense of what's fair and what's right. I'm committed, as President, to ensuring that we have the tools to prevent the kinds of abuses that sent AIG spiraling in the first place, so we never again put our financial system at that kind of risk, and we're not held hostage by companies that are, quote, unquote, \"too big to fail.\"","We also want to do this because it serves the most important goal we have today, which is to rebuild our economy in a way that's consistent with our values, an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility, not high-flying financial schemes; an economy that's built on a strong foundation, not one that's propelled by an overheated housing market or everybody maxing out on their credit cards. We need to bring about a recovery that endures.","You remember remember that ad where it used to say, \"We earn money the old-fashioned way; we earn it.\" Right? \"We make money the old-fashioned way; we earn it.\" That's what we have to do. We have to get back to the principle of hard work and innovation and dedication. And that's exactly the purpose of the budget I'm submitting to Congress. It's a budget that makes hard choices about where to save and where to spend. Because of the massive deficit we inherited and the cost of this financial crisis, we're going through our books, line by line, so that we can cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term and reduce it by $2 trillion over the next decade.","Now, I know that the Governor is having to make these same tough choices. There are going to be initiatives here that talk about the need for everybody to chip in, everybody to give a little something up in order to get our fiscal house in order. We're going to have to do that same thing at the Federal level. Mayor Villaraigosa has got to do the same thing with respect to city budgets. These are tough times. What we won't do, though, is cut investments that will lead to real growth and real prosperity over the long term, investments that will make a difference in the lives of this generation and future generations.","So because we know that spiraling health care costs are crushing families and dragging down the entire economy, and because we know it represents one of the fastest growing parts of our budget, we've made a historic commitment to health care reform in this budget, reform that brings us closer to the day when health care is affordable and accessible for every single American. That's something we've got to shoot for. It's time. It's time. It's time.","We know and we've got three principals right here in the front row we know that we know and they know that countries that out-educate us today will outcompete us tomorrow. And that's why my budget invests in a complete and competitive education for every American, in early childhood education programs that work, in high standards and accountability for our schools, in finally putting the dream of a college degree or technical training within reach for anybody who wants it.","Because we know that enhancing America's competitiveness will require reducing our dependence on foreign oil and building a clean energy economy, this budget will spark the transformation we need to create green jobs and launch renewable energy companies right here in California. It makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy and invests in technologies like wind power and solar power and fuel-efficient cars and trucks and high-speed rail powered by batteries like the one I saw in Pomona earlier today all of which will help us combat climate change. That's got to be a priority. That's what this budget does.","Now, here's what this budget doesn't do. It doesn't raise taxes on any family making less than a 150 $250,000 a year, by a single dime. In fact, 95 percent of all working families will receive a tax cut as a result of our recovery plan.","Now, there are those who say these plans are too ambitious, that anything we should be trying to do is just focused on the banking crisis, that we should be trying to do less not more. In fact, somebody was saying the other today, I think, that I shouldn't be on Leno. I can't handle that and the economy at the same time.","Listen, here's what I say. I say our challenges are too big to ignore. The cost of our health care is too high to ignore. Our dependence on oil is too dangerous to ignore. Our education deficit is too wide to ignore. To kick these problems down the road for another 4 years or 8 years, that would be to continue the same irresponsibility that led us to this point in the first place. And I did not run for President to pass on our problems to the next generation. I ran for President to solve these problems for the next generation and for the next President. So I that's what you want.","I know some folks on Washington and on Wall Street are saying we should just focus on their problems, and I understand the thinking behind that. It would be nice if I could just pick and choose what problems to face, when to face them. So I could say, well, no, I don't want to deal with war in Afghanistan right now, and I'd prefer not having to deal with climate change right now. And if you could just hold on even though you don't have health care, just please wait, because I've got other things to do.","But that's not how things work. That's not how it works for you. You don't get to choose between paying your mortgage bills or your medical bills. You don't get to choose between paying your kids' tuition and saving enough for retirement. You've got to take all those problems on at the same time, and you need a government that will do the same. That's what leadership is about; that's what the debate on this budget is all about about whether we're willing to do what it needs to be done to get our economy moving and put people back to work and put us on the road to shared and lasting priorities. That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to focus on. We're going to get it done with your help. I need you all.","Okay. All right. This is the fun part of the program. Everybody have a seat. This is the fun part of the program. Now, first of all, we haven't prescreened anybody. So if you don't like me, go ahead and just say, you know, \"You're a bum.\" That's okay. Hold on, hold on one second. Just hold on. Just a couple of rules. First of all, we're going to go girl, boy, girl, boy. I'm not going to be able to get to every question, so, people, raise your hands. I'll try to get as many as possible; we'll try to go around the room.","There are people with microphones in the audience this young lady, for example an example. So wait until she gets there so everybody can hear your question. And the only other thing is, since we have a lot of people and not that much time, if everybody could try to keep their question relatively short that will be helpful. Okay? And stand when I've called on you. You don't need to stand before I've called on you, but stand when I've called on you.","Q. My name is Patricia Zae.","[SPEAKER]. Hey, Patricia.","Q. Hi. First, I want to say I'm very glad and thankful that you are our President. And 5 years ago I told my friend Tim that Barack Obama will be President, and he said, no, not in my lifetime there won't be a black President. And I said, \"Just wait a few years.\" And when you won I said, \"I told you so.\"","[SPEAKER]. See there. Always satisfying to say, \"I told you so.\"","Q. And he was very happy. But he was very happy for me to tell him so.","[SPEAKER]. Good.","Q. So my question is, you talk about health care, which usually means insurance after you're sick. What about making our lifestyle healthier? Like we have corn syrup, we have trans fats, in all that food those things are illegal in Europe. And I know people that go to Europe and they overeat, but they lose weight because our their foods don't have all the hormones and the additives. And also, you know that Clinton put legislation into that limited the dumping of mercury into the rivers, and then you-know-who came into office and took that legislation away, and now the","[SPEAKER]. Okay, all right, all right, all right.","Q. are out of control.","[SPEAKER]. Okay. Let me answer your first question.","Q. Are you going to put that legislation","[SPEAKER]. Okay. First of all, if you burn that many calories asking a question you know, I mean, she's fired up. So you'll be able to eat whatever you want.","Q. No, not trans fats","[SPEAKER]. Anyway, all right, let me answer your question. And that did you just hit hand the mike to somebody else.","This is actually a serious question. You're exactly right that if we are going to reform our health care system, what we can't do is simply add more people to a hugely inefficient system that is costing us more and more each and every year, because eventually it will bankrupt families, it will bankrupt State governments, and it will bankrupt the country.","So the only way that we can initiate true health care reform is if we control costs. And one of the most important ways for us to control costs is to deal with the issue of prevention, which means making sure that we have proper nutrition programs in our schools, making sure that we've got effective physical education programs for our children. It means making sure that everybody has access to a primary care doctor and that they are getting regular checkups, that we are avoiding preventable diseases like diabetes that are helping to shoot our medical costs through the roof.","So that's going to be a huge component of whatever health care reform package that I sign, is a major push towards prevention. There's some other areas where we can do some important cost savings as well. Information technology the Recovery Act provides billions of dollars just putting our medical records online so .","Okay, hold on one second. If we've got a replacement mike that would be helpful, because this one's going in and out a little bit. You got one? Well, no, but you need that for your guys. There we go.","Let's okay, that's good. But these if everybody's data medical data is in digital form with important privacy protections, we can reduce medical errors, we can make sure that doctors and nurses, pharmacists are all communicating more effectively. We'll have, actually, better quality in hospitals, and we will also be driving down costs. So there are a whole host of measures that we put down payments on, on the recovery package, but we've got to get our budget passed in order to actually make it happen.","One last point I'll make; something that has not been getting a lot of attention. We signed a renewal of the Children's Health Insurance Program that added millions of children, including children of legal immigrants, into the mix. That's an important tool to prevent long-term diseases that can cost us a lot of money.","All right, the gentleman right here. The gentleman right here with the beard.","Q. No, I'm unable to stand up. I believe that I'm entitled to an exception of that rule under the ADA.","Event staff member. Oh, I'm so sorry.","Q. I forgive you.","[SPEAKER]. Go ahead.","Q. Okay.","[SPEAKER]. Introduce yourself.","Q. I'm Gary Karp, and [SPEAKER], thank God for you. Sir, my question regards the true renaissance that's happening with people with disabilities. They are an emerging population, millions of people with more potential in capacity, more mobile, more educated, more healthy, more empowered technology, but still trapped in very, very old social models that see them in terms of tragedy and charity and need and care. And the modern population of people with disabilities simply does not fit that model.","And as your plan succeeds and you generate these jobs, and as baby boomers retire, we're going to need every single person of capacity to work that we can. And that must include many, many, many thousands, if not millions, of people with disabilities.","So I see you nodding your head, so my first question is, do you subscribe to what I'm saying, and next of all, can you talk about how your disability agenda will release this emerging potential that's currently wasted and untapped?","[SPEAKER]. Well, you are exactly right, that we need everybody. And every program that we have has to be thinking on the front end, how do we make sure that it is inclusive and building into it our ability to draw on the capacities of persons with disabilities. That's true on the education front where our recovery package increases funding for children with disabilities. It is true in terms of how Hilda Solis, our Secretary of Labor, will be thinking about our training programs, to make sure that we are not excluding from training for high-tech jobs the new jobs of the future persons with disability. It means enforcing the ADA and fighting back on some of court opinions that have tried to narrow, in ways that I think are inappropriate, the original intent of that legislation.","So one of the things that I think is important is to make sure, as you pointed out, that we don't see this as an afterthought, a segregated program, but we are infusing every department, every agency, every act that we take with a mindfulness about the importance of persons with disabilities, their skills, their talents, their capacity. That I think is the approach that my administration is going to take, and we hope that by taking that approach that attitude will infuse State and local governments that are also receiving Federal money. Okay?","This young lady right here has had her hand up for a while.","Q. Hello, [SPEAKER]","[SPEAKER]. Don't worry, I'm going to get around. Hold on a second, I'm going around. Go ahead.","Q. Hello.","[SPEAKER]. Hi.","Q. My name is Sharnette.","[SPEAKER]. Hey, Sharnette.","Q. And first of all, I would just like to say, as a mixed-race individual, it's so fantastic to finally have a role model and a leader that I can actually identify with, so thank you.","[SPEAKER]. Well, that's nice. Thank you.","Q. They're haven't been a whole lot, growing up. So, okay, so my question is specific to California. As you know, we have one of the highest costs of living in the U.S. here. A household income that is considered middle or upper class in any other State wouldn't go very far here. However, the tax laws and the recent economic stimulus address household income on a national level and do not take into account the cost of living by State, as far as I know. California now has, as you mentioned before, a higher unemployment rate than the national average; we make up one-third of Nation's foreclosures.","So what I want to know is, what can be done to address California's unique and unique situation and stimulate the economy here in California, and like you mentioned, just be prosperous into the future, keeping in mind, again, household incomes. And we're not really apples-to-apples with other States, but we're taxed as if we are.","[SPEAKER]. Well, look, I mean, obviously, there's differentiation between States both in terms of cost of living, but also in terms of salaries. And generally, those are taken into account through the deductions that are available through the Tax Code. I would say that the biggest problem, though, is probably not in our Tax Code is not the difference between how Californians are treated and people in Idaho are treated. The bigger difference actually has to do with how people inside California are treated by the Tax Code.","So if you are a multimillionaire who get most of your income from dividends and capital gains, then you're typically paying 15 percent of your income in taxes at the Federal level. But if you're a secretary making $30,000 a year in wages, then you're paying a higher rate. Now, so the secretary is paying a higher rate than Warren Buffett as a percentage of their income. That's the inequity that I think is most destructive, because what it's done is, over the last decade the average working family has seen their median income flatline; their wages and income have not gone up.","On the other hand, people who were at the very top of the income scale, and I'm now included in that category, we've seen all the benefits of economic growth when things were going well. And I actually think that contributes to a cycle of bubble and bust. And if we have a situation in which middle class people are earning a decent living, where we've got bottom-up economic growth, then I think that's good for everybody. I think ultimately that's good for businesses. I think it's good for rich folks, because when the economy rises, everybody does well. And you don't get as many distortions as you've gotten in this sort of bubble-and-bust cycle that we've had.","Now, there are some things in California that we are doing that focus on particular needs here. We just talked Governor Schwarzenegger and Mayor Villaraigosa here in Los Angeles, for example, there is an enormous opportunity to deal with traffic and transit and transportation in a way that will relieve congestion, make this economy more efficient, more productive. But the needs of Los Angeles in terms of transportation dollars are going to be different from the needs of somebody in a predominantly rural State.","And one of the things that we want to do in terms of how transportation dollars flow is to start emphasizing the fact that the vast majority of people live in suburbs or in cities in metropolitan regions, and how can we do a better job in planning and coordinating regionally so that you aren't in your car for 2 hours a day. There are things that we can do that end up being specific to the situation of the economy in California, but generally, California oftentimes gets hit worse when recessions come, but you also rise up faster when the economy starts to recover. So I'm confident California will continue to be on the cutting edge of our economy.","All right, it's a guy's turn, so ladies, put your hands down. It's a guy's turn. This gentleman right here, right here.","Q. [SPEAKER], I really don't have a question, but I'd like to offer up to you a young lady by the name of Lena Kennedy who hosted you in Pasadena as possibly your domestic policy adviser for children and families.","[SPEAKER]. Oh, okay. All right.","Q. And my name is John Kennedy.","[SPEAKER]. Okay, John. All right, well, we'll does she know that you were just doing that?","Q. No. Oh, no.","[SPEAKER]. That's a shame. She's going to be all embarrassed. All right, since that wasn't really a question, I'm going to call on another guy.","Gentleman back there in the cap, right there. Let's get a microphone. Right there.","National Economy","Q. Thank you.","[SPEAKER]. What's your name?","Q. My name is Peter Graff. I immigrated here from Germany, and last summer, I was very excited when you had that wonderful reception in Berlin.","Now, former Vice President Cheney used to say deficits don't matter. But since you inherited his mess, the national debt has been growing and growing and no ending in sight. I'm very happy you are in the White House, but for the first time I'm worried about this country, the stability and the future.","My question: How is there a chance that we may follow in the footsteps of Iceland and one day just simply be broke? That's the question.","[SPEAKER]. No.","Q. Thank you.","[SPEAKER]. No. But, you know, there is a chance that we leave such a mountain of debt to the next generation that it makes them poor over the long term, because we're having to borrow from foreign countries, make interest payments to other countries, and that over time standards of living here are lower than they should be relative to other countries. So we've got to get control of our deficit.","Now, you're right, I inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. And we saw the national debt double during the previous administration, which is why when I hear generally, I'm a I try to be a bipartisan guy, but when I hear some folks from the other party in Congress start howling about the deficits, I'm starting to think, well, where have you been? What have you been doing?","I mean, you would've thought a good time to do something about deficits was when the economy was going good, right? You would have thought that's when you would have been saving away a little bit. If you had inherited a surplus, you would have thought that maybe, you know, we'll maintain that. So I don't put much stock in some of those political attacks. But what is true is that the path we're on right now is unsustainable.","So here's what we have to do. Our most immediate and urgent task is to put people back to work and get the economy rolling again. That's the thing we have to do right now. And that means that for the next couple of years, we're going to have to tolerate much higher deficits than I'm comfortable with, not just for the recovery package, but the money that we've had to put in to deal with the financial crisis. The fact that people are out of work means they are needing unemployment insurance, they need additional there are greater needs for food stamps. All sorts of pressures and strains are placed on State government and local governments during a deep recession like this one.","So we've got to suffer some big deficits while we move into recovery. The worst thing we could do is not worry about recovery, slash government spending at the same time as businesses are slashing their spending and consumers are slashing their spending. That creates a downward spiral that could make things even worse.","But as soon as we start seeing a recovery and my hope is, is that over the next couple of years, we will have started moving again, building back up then what we have to do is build in a pathway for reducing our deficits. We've already, in this budget, slated that in the out years we're going to reduce nondiscretionary nondefense discretionary spending. Everything other than defense spending and entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, we're going to reduce those to the lowest level relative to GDP of any time since the 1960s.","I've also said that we are going to end the Iraq war, which is going to save us money during that period of time. We are going to have to reform Medicare, and that's part of the overall health care reform that we were talking about earlier. If we can get control of health care costs as a whole, then we can start bending the curve of costs for Medicare and Medicaid.","So we are already making some tough choices, reducing the deficit by $2 trillion, but we're going to have to do more. And the biggest thing we're going to have to do is take on Medicare and Medicaid health care costs. That's going to be the most important thing that we can do over the long term. All right.","Okay. It's a woman's turn. This young lady back there, go ahead.","Education Reform at the Local Level","Q. Hello, [SPEAKER], my name is Blanca Aguilar Gomez. And this question is on behalf of my sister, who's a public school teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School District, and on behalf of all the children, which is over 700,000 children the second-largest school district in the Nation we need help.","Even with the best leadership that we have currently with the district, with Board President Monica Garcia and the new superintendent, Ray Cortines, you know, we don't the State doesn't have the money, and we're having to lay off thousands of teachers, you know, it's scary for our children.","You know, even with the stimulus packet, in 3 years, I think, we're going to be in a deficit of $1.3 billion. Where are we going to get that money?","[SPEAKER]. Well, this is why before we came on, the Governor and I were talking. And the fact is, is that we are massively ramping up education spending at the Federal level, on a whole variety of fronts. But historically most education funding is done at the State level, at the local level.","So we may be able to take education funding at the Federal level from 7 percent to 9 percent, for example, but the lion's share is still going to be coming locally. And that's why it's so important for everybody to be engaged in the various initiatives that are going to be coming up, to make sure that what you just articulated, the need to invest in our kids, that that is reflected in terms of State budgets.","Now, one thing I've got to say, though and I think I speak for every public official here you can't have something for nothing. You can't have something for nothing. I was in the White House, and we had done this event when we signed stem cell research, and a woman who was in the audience, she came up to me and she shook my hand and she said, \"Oh, President Obama, I'm very excited, but you just had this health care forum please, please, I hope your plan is free health care for all.\" And I said, \"Listen, nothing is free.\" Nothing is free.","So the reason I make that point is you can't ask local elected officials to raise teachers' salaries and cut taxes and balance the budget and increase roads. At some point you've got to make some choices. So if you want a high quality education and California historically had the best education system in the country then somebody has got to pay for it.","Now, the obligation of local officials and this is the same is true on the Federal Government our obligation is to make sure that every dime of money is being spent wisely, every dime of money is being spent wisely.","And when it comes to education and I'm speaking to teachers here and educators let me say this I want to do some truth-telling here. Uh-oh. I love teachers. There is no profession that is more important than teaching. My sister is a teacher, but and I am a huge supporter of the teachers' unions. They were some of my first supporters. But let me tell you, you can't just be talking more money, more money, without also talking about how are we going to reform and make the system better. There's got to be a reform agenda in exchange for the money. There's got to be a reform agenda in exchange for the money.","So don't just say, give us more money or smaller classrooms, but you're not willing to consider, for example, how are we going to do better assessments. Or how are going to work to improve teacher performance, and if a teacher is not improving, how do we get them to choose a different career, right? I mean, there's got to be some serious conversation about that.","Now, before I get off the topic of the education, let me do a little more truth-telling. Parents, you can't complain about the schools and complain about the teachers, but when your child comes home, they're playing video games and not doing homework, and you don't have time to go to your teacher and parent teacher-parent meeting. Our parents have to instill a sense of excellence and a thirst for knowledge.","And the truth of the matter is, even as overcrowded as schools may be, as poor the computer equipment may be, if you took a bunch of kids right now from China or India and you put them in these classrooms, from their perspective these would be unbelievable schools. I mean, they don't have better facilities, but they're out-performing us in math and science. Why is that? Well, part of it is, is that we as parents are not insisting and demanding on the kind of higher performance from our kids. So everybody has got to be more accountable in order to improve our education system.","All right. It's a man's turn. I'm going to turn back here this guy in the green shirt, right here. Everybody likes you, man. What, is he on like \"Gossip Girl\" or something? I don't I didn't recognize him, but maybe he's is he a movie star? Who's got a mike? Go ahead.","Changing America","Q. Not a movie star, just one of your volunteers.","[SPEAKER]. There you go.","Q. And they're all around here. And in my book, that's even more powerful. I guess that's the fundamental question I have is, there's such a passion in this country, and you inspired such a passion for us to do things that we never had before in the name of volunteerism, in the name of making you become our President like and thank you to everyone that was involved with that.","My question is, clearly this is not something you can do alone in terms of changing our country. How can we best partner with you, how can we be most effective, moving forward, to change this country?","[SPEAKER]. Well, the first thing, I think, is patience. No, I'm serious about this, because, look, there was a lot of excitement during the campaign, and we were talking about the importance of bringing about change. We are moving systematically to bring about change. But change is hard. Change doesn't happen overnight. And the change we bring has to be matched by a sense of responsibility, because if you try to just change things overnight and you haven't thought everything through, you could have some real problems.","So for example, I closed Guantanamo. That was the right thing to do. But I made the but in making that decision I said we're going to take a year to figure out how are we going to deal with the folks who are detained there, some of whom really are dangerous folks, who if we just release them could do us harm. I believe that we are going to be able to effectively balance our national security needs with our civil liberties concerns, but it's not something that happens overnight. We've got to do it systematically.","On the economy, this financial crisis that we've had is the largest since the Great Depression. I understand how mad everybody is about this AIG bonus business. I understand that. As I said before, I'm mad. And even though I didn't draw up these AIG contracts, my White House didn't it's my responsibility to fix the system. But fixing the system requires us understanding that if banks are not solvent, if they are not lending, then businesses are not going to be able to invest; we are not going to be able to create jobs. And we can be as mad as we want, but the fact of the matter is, we've got to work through this huge mess that was made in the financial system. It's going to cost some money. It's not going to be pretty; people are going to be frustrated. And we are going to get it done. So on a whole range of these fronts, the first thing we need from the American people is a sense that we are going to get it done, but it's going to take a little bit of time.","The second thing is keep paying attention to the debates that are taking place right now, so when we have a big budget debate I want everybody who was paying so much attention during the election to be as interested what's going on in terms of education spending, what's going on in terms of higher health care spending, are the investments we're planning to make on energy, are they right ones? Because, again, we're going to have some tough choices to make.","I can't just keep on I can't print money. And so if we are going to make a serious investment in clean energy, well, that requires that we phase out dirty energy. And that requires that we stop subsidizing certain things and instead subsidize other things. Somebody is not going to be happy about that because they've been getting the subsidies, so they will start running ads on television saying this is a terrible energy plan.","And you've got to pay attention and educate your coworkers and educate your friends and your family. And we're not my administration also here's one last claim I want to make, a guarantee. We are not always going to be right, and I don't want everybody disappointed if we make a mistake here or there. The important point is, are we moving in the right direction; are we, generally speaking, consistent with our campaign promises; are we reflecting the values of hard-working middle class Americans who are trying to see Washington work for them?","And that's one thing I can assure you of, is that 4 years from now, you are going to be able to look back and you're going to say, \"You know what A, the guy worked hard on what he said he was going to work hard on during the campaign, and he may not have gotten everything perfect, but we are moving in the right direction.\" That's what we've that's what we're going to be focused on over the next few years.","All right, I've only got time for a couple more questions. All right. I've got to I'm trying to look. I'm going to go way up there. Way up there. Yes, that young it's a young lady's turn right there. Right there.","Financial Aid for Higher Education/Voluntarism","Q. Hi, President Obama. My name is Kirsten Perry, and I'm a recent college graduate. My mom is a teacher and my dad is a disabled carpenter, so needless to say, I have accrued a significant amount of student loan debt. And I want to know what your administration is going to do for young people like me who are educated, who are new to the workforce, who would be ready to enter the housing market, ready to invest in small business, ready to take lower paying jobs like teaching, but can't because we're burdened with an excess of student loans?","[SPEAKER]. Right, well, it's a great question. It's a great question. Here's what we're going to be doing going forward, so let me start there. In our current budget, we are calling for mandatory increases in Pell grant programs to keep up with inflation, improvements in the Perkins loan program. We are going to cut out the middle men, banks that are making huge profits on student loans, just make those loans that are federally guaranteed directly to the students. That will save us billions of dollars that will allow us to expand student loan assistance and grant assistance to more people.","So we've got a significant increase in student loan support slated in this budget. Now, I recognize, though, if you've already graduated then that may not that will be cold comfort for you. And one of the things that we're trying to figure out is are there ways that we can lower interest rates or principal on some of the existing student loans that are out there by consolidation or other tools. We have not announced an official program on that front, but we do believe that there are going to be some things that we can do.","This is an example, by the way, of where the banking reforms that we are talking about are so important. We just announced some changes, for example, in the ability of the student loan market, the secondary market of securitized student loans to be purchased in such a way that we can reduce the interest rates on student loans for everybody. But if we don't help the banks it's going to be hard for us in order to lower some of these student loan rates. So a lot of these things are intertwined, and we've got to make sure that we deal with that.","The last point I want to make I expect that over the next couple of weeks, maybe even next week, we are going to be in a position to sign a national service bill coming from the House and the Senate, and as part of this, what we're going to be doing is expanding programs like the Peace Corps and Teach For America and other mechanisms, other avenues where you can make a decision as a young person to teach for 3 years or to serve in the Peace Corps or to serve in the Foreign Service or volunteer in some fashion in your communities and help finance your education in the process. And I think there are young people all across California, all across America, who are interested in that opportunity, and I want to give that opportunity to you.","All right. Okay, this is the last question. You know, I'm going to on the last question I think I hold on a second, I think I want to call on I want to call on a young person, a student. But it's got to be a guy it's a guy. No, no, you're not that young, you sit down. That guy right there. The young guy in the T-shirt, or in the tie in the tie. This young man right here. That guy right there.","All right, you've got to stand up, though. You look good in that tie.","Education Reform","Q. Hi, my name is Ethan. President Obama, our school is in big trouble because of budget cuts are 25 of our teachers already have been fired, to get pink slips. And the whole school, my class, we made this.","[SPEAKER]. Oh, you made are those letters for me?","Q. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. What's your name?","Q. Ethan Lopez.","[SPEAKER]. Ethan Lopez. How old are you, Ethan?","Q. Eight.","[SPEAKER]. Eight. So what grade are you in?","Q. Third grade.","[SPEAKER]. Third grade. Do you like school?","Q. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. Yes, you do? Is that your mom next to you?","Q. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. Yes. She looks very nice. Well, let me as I said before, Ethan, we're going to do everything we can to protect our teachers. We already passed a law in Washington that's going to give more money to the State to help keep teachers in their jobs. And one of the things that we didn't talk about earlier, we're also going to be putting more money into school construction, because there are a lot of overcrowded schools and overcrowded classrooms that don't aren't wired for the Internet effectively. And we are going to make sure that we invest in that as well, because I want you to get a first-class education.","What do you want to be when you grow up, have you decided yet?","Q. Yes.","[SPEAKER]. What would you like to be?","Q. A cop.","[SPEAKER]. A cop. That's what I'm talking about, all right.","Well, I can tell that you will be an outstanding police officer. Your mom is proud of you. We're all proud of you. Give Ethan a big round of applause.","Thank you, everybody. God bless you."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksunity98dinner1","text":["Thank you. I know you need a stretch, but it's going on too long. ","Let me just say the most important words I can say: Thank you. Thank you for your support for me and for our administration and for our candidates for Senate and Congress and for the whole concept of this Unity campaign. Thank you, Representative Pelosi and Leader Gephardt and Senator Torricelli and Steve Grossman, all dedicated Democrats, all dedicated Americans.","Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for the wonderful work that you have done in so many ways, and everything that we've done together in the last 5 1/2 years.","In 1996, when the American people were good enough to give the Vice President and me another term and made me the first Democratic President in 60 years, since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936, to be reelected, we picked up some seats in the House. And if we had picked up a few more, we would have won the House. There was, I think, one overwhelming reason: In the last 10 days, even though we had the issues and the direction, we were outspent in the 20 closest districts 4 1/2 to one.","But we did begin this Unity concept a little too late, but it still did very well. All of our contributors liked it because all three committees weren't asking at the same time to give money or raise it. But it was the right thing to do, because we could work on helping particular candidates, targeting particular States, going after particular constituencies, getting our turnout up.","This year we're trying to go sooner and do more. And I cannot say enough for what I believe is the vision of the leaders of the House, the Senate, and the Democratic Committee for doing this early and doing it together and in good faith with a good heart. The Vice President and I and the First Lady and Tipper, we're all committed to making this work.","The Vice President gave that wonderful portrait of what's happened the last 6 years through chapter 6. Chapter 7 is, we win if we do the right things; if we do the right things, we win.","Hillary came up with this great motto for the millennial celebration we're going to have on New Year's Eve 1999-2000 and between now and then: \"Honor the past; imagine the future.\" And we started out a couple of weeks ago honoring the past by announcing grants by private citizens to help us save the Star-Spangled Banner. It's hard to think of anything that embodies our past more. And then Hillary went to Thomas Edison's* home in New Jersey to talk about saving that and then to Harriet Tubman's home, then to George Washington's revolutionary headquarters, then to New York to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the women's movement, all honoring the past.","But we've also had a lot of interesting lectures at the White House imagining the future. Stephen Hawking, the great physicist from Cambridge, England, came and spoke in a very heroic way, because he suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease, about what we would learn about the larger world in the future. We had poets for the first time in a long time, a genuine poetry reading in the White House with our poet laureates and ordinary citizens, including children, thinking about their future.","Steve said that never, at least—I quit looking at the Civil War because I'm not sure before that political trends are indicative. But since the Civil War, the party of the President in the President's second term has always lost some seats at midterm. But there is a reason for that which we have determined to erase—and these records are made to be changed—and that is, that generally there is the sense that no matter how well liked the President might be, the term is three-quarters over, so what else is new?","Well, when I was reelected, the Vice President and I sat down one day, and I told our people, I said, \"Look, I want us to drive the agenda of this country until the last hour of the last day of my term in January of 2001. That is what we signed on for. That is what we owe the American people. That is the right thing to do.\" And if you look at what is happening today, our party—I love what Dick Gephardt said about, when he was the majority leader, how he met with the minority leader and how we tried to work together. Because this election fundamentally is not about the Democratic Party. It's about the American people, and it's about our agenda, which puts progress over partisanship and people over power and unity over division.","We believe this country has big challenges. We believe, first, you don't sit on a lead in a global economy and society like the one we're living in. You know, the temptation is, after all the tough years we had, \"Things are going so well now; why don't we just relax, kick back, and enjoy it?\" All you have to do is pick up the paper every day to know that it's a reasonably dynamic world we're living in.","If someone had told you 5 years ago that Japan would have 5 years of one percent growth a year during which time the stock market there would lose half its value, would you have believed that? Is there a person in this room that really thought that would happen? If there is, I'd like to clean out what little I've got left in my bank account and let you be my investment adviser from now on.","Now, they're a very great country, and they're going to come back. I don't mean that in a negative way. I'm trying to point out that nothing stays the same. The way people work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the world is changing at a breathtaking pace. Nobody is smart enough to understand it all and figure out all of its ramifications. But I know this: When people have the good fortune of good times, they should take their treasure and their confidence and think about tomorrow and deal with the long-term challenges of the country.","There are four big issues that I think will sweep across the country this year and carry us home if our party will advance them.","Number one, we waited 29 years to get out of the red. Let's don't run out and spend this surplus on a tax cut or a spending program until we save the Social Security system for the 21st century so that the baby boomers don't bankrupt their kids and their ability to raise their grandchildren when we retire.","Number two, managed care, on balance, has been a good thing for America because we couldn't sustain inflation in health care costs at 3 times the rate of inflation in the economy. That was an unsustainable trend that developed in the 1980's. But it is just a device, and it must not be allowed to block quality care. Therefore, we should have a Patients' Bill of Rights that puts quality care back at the center of the health care debate.","People should have access to the medical care they need; decisions should be made by doctors, not by accountants; people shouldn't be turned away from emergency rooms or specialists if they need them; and their privacy should not be violated in the medical arena. That's what this Patients' Bill of Rights is all about. It's a first step toward reconciling the imperative of having better management in the health care system with keeping health care uppermost in the health care system.","And a lot of you are in the health care business. One of the reasons we need legislation is, it is simply unfair to all the good people out there in health care today that are already complying with the requirements of the Patients' Bill of Rights because they think it is the morally right thing to do. It is unfair for them to be at an economic disadvantage with those who don't. So we need a Patients' Bill of Rights.","Number three, we have succeeded in the last 5 1/2 years in opening the doors of college to just about everybody in America. The HOPE scholarship makes the first 2 years of college virtually free to most Americans. It certainly makes community college virtually free to most Americans. We now have tax credits for the junior and senior year and for graduate school. The interest deductibility on student loans is back. We've dramatically increased scholarships and work-study positions. We had 100,000 young people go through AmeriCorps. One of you told me you had a child going to California in the AmeriCorps program, and I thank you for that.","But no one believes that we still even after all this, we still can't say that we have the best elementary and secondary education in the world for all Americans. We have an agenda for smaller classes, more teachers, more welltrained teachers, modernized schools, hooking up all the classrooms to the Internet, more after-school programs, more summer school programs for kids in difficult areas with troubled lives—things that we know work—higher standards, greater accountability, more charter schools, more school choice. We've got an agenda, and we think it ought to be supported. So we have a better schools agenda.","Number four, after this summer, I take it no one seriously questions the fact that the climate is genuinely changing. The 9 hottest years on record have occurred in the last 11 years. The 5 hottest years in history have occurred in the 1990's. Last year was the hottest year on record; this year every month has been hotter than the same month last year. This is not a joke.","We still have 40 percent of our water that's not safe for swimming, in spite of all the work since the Clean Water Act passed. We still have problems with safe drinking water in some places. We still have too many toxic waste dumps in some places.","If there is one thing America has learned since 1970, it is that we improve the quality of life and the strength of the economy when we clean up the environment in the right way. So this old-fashioned, antienvironmental rhetoric doesn't hold much water. We've got to face the environmental challenges of today and tomorrow and do them in a way that promotes new markets, new technologies, new jobs, but a cleaner environment and a growing economy.","So those, I think, are the four great national issues: save Social Security, pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, improve the public schools, clean up the environment and improve the economy. There are lots of local issues. In a lot of places our farmers are in trouble. A lot of urban areas, where we have a good empowerment agenda, still haven't felt the economic recovery. But Social Security first, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the school agenda, the environmental agenda, those things will help us to move forward. And if we can get the Congress to face our clear international economic responsibilities, which take an awful lot of my time these days, then obviously that's something that the new Congress won't have to do. And I'm still hoping and praying that we'll face up to our responsibilities as Americans and do the International Monetary Fund and these other things we have to do.","But that is an agenda we can win on. You win elections with a message, with candidates, and with the means for the candidate to get the message to the people. That's what the Unity campaign is all about. I believe that I've gone to more of these events than any person in America in the last 6 years. Therefore, the happiest citizen in the United States was me when the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill passed the House last week.","And we Democrats have been almost unanimous in support of real campaign finance reform. The other party's leadership has been unanimous against it, although we have had some of their great renegades. We got 51, I think, bolted and voted with us last week, and I applaud them. But until we get that done, we've got the candidates; we've got the message; you're giving us the means to get the message out; and you're going to have a lot to celebrate this November.","Thank you, and God bless you."]}

When his platoon was forced from its position by a numerically superior enemy force, and his platoon leader wounded, Sergeant Lee assumed command, regrouped the remnants of his unit, and led them in repeated assaults to regain the position. Within twenty-five yards of his objective he received a leg wound from grenade fragments, but refused assistance and continued the attack. Although forced to withdraw five times, each time he regrouped his remaining men and renewed the assault. Moving forward at the head of his small group in the fifth attempt, he was struck by an exploding grenade, knocked to the ground and seriously wounded in both legs. Still refusing assistance, he advanced by crawling, rising to his knees to fire, and urging his men to follow. While thus directing the final assault he was wounded a third time, by small arms fire. Persistently continuing to crawl forward he directed his men in a final and successful attack which regained the vital objective. His intrepid leadership and determination led to the destruction of eighty-three of the enemy and withdrawal of the remainder, and was a vital factor in stopping the enemy attack. Sergeant Lee's indomitable courage, consummate valor and outstanding leadership reflect the highest credit upon himself, and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Infantry and the United States Army.","[INTERVIEWER]","[INTERVIEWED], authorized by Act of Congress approved March 3, 1863 has awarded in the name of The Congress the Medal of Honor to","Sergeant Rodriguez (then Private first Class), Infantry, United States Army, Company F, 17th Infantry Regiment, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an armed enemy of the United Nations near Munye-ri, Korea, on 21 May 1951. Sergeant Rodriguez, an assistant squad leader of the 2d Platoon, was participating in an attack against a fanatical hostile force occupying well-fortified positions on rugged commanding terrain, when his squad's advance was halted within approximately sixty yards by a withering barrage of automatic weapons and small arms fire from five emplacements directly to the front and right and left flanks, together with grenades which the enemy rolled down the hill toward the advancing troops. Fully aware of the odds against him, Sergeant Rodriguez leaped to his feet, dashed sixty yards up the fire-swept slope, and after lobbing grenades into the first foxhole with deadly accuracy, ran around the left flank, silenced an automatic weapon with two grenades and continued his whirlwind assault to the top of the peak, wiping out two more foxholes and then, reaching the right flank, he tossed grenades into the remaining emplacement, destroying the gun and annihilating its crew. Sergeant Rodriguez' intrepid actions exacted a toll of fifteen enemy dead and, as a result of his incredible display of valor, the defense of the opposition was broken, the enemy routed, and the strategic strong point secured. His unflinching courage under fire and inspirational devotion to duty reflect highest credit on himself and uphold the honored traditions of the military service."]}

This represents more than $1 1/3 billion a month, more than $16 billion a year, providing a much more secure life for our citizens and contributing a great deal of economic soundness to our economic system.","Millions of other Americans at their jobs each day are building up future benefits and looking forward to the day when they will qualify.","Franklin Roosevelt called the original Social Security Act, and I quote, \"a cornerstone in a structure which is being built but is by no means complete.\" That is true today as it was 30 years ago when President Roosevelt stated it.","We are working steadily with the enlightened Members of the Senate and the Congress and the Cabinet here with me this morning to build and to strengthen the social security system.

And on behalf of Nancy and myself, and from the bottom of our hearts, thank you all for your very warm welcome.","It's been a fascinating and rewarding 10 days, and now our long journey is nearly over. I was interested to read one report on whether the meetings were a success or not this morning. It seems that TASS, the Russian news agency, says that I was a failure at trying to eat a pigeon egg with my chopsticks. And as usual, TASS was wrong. It wasn't a pigeon egg; it was a quail egg. And I got it on the second stab.","But we traveled almost 20,000 miles to Hawaii, Guam, and finally, Chinato the cities of Beijing, Xi'an, and Shanghai. We saw the wonders of that country and the fine antiquities of the old civilization. But I think the best moment was late last night-or I should say, early this morning.","Now, I had it all in mind that I was going to talk about coming through the darkness and then finally seeing the lights of the coast of Alaska down below -and the coastline there, and that we knew that we were seeing America again, and we were home. Well, there was a cloud cover all the way over the Pacific Ocean. So, the lights that we saw were the lights of Fairbanks, and believe me, we knew we were home, and it was just fine.","There's a poem that was popular when I was a boy. It was a poem about the American soldiers returning from the trenches in the First World War. They admired the grandeur and the oldness of Europe, but their hearts longed for the newness of their own country. And upon their return, in that poem they said:","So it's home again and home again, America for me. My heart is turning home again and there I long to be. The blessed land of room enough beyond the ocean bars, Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. Well, it's good to be back in our blessed land.","We went to China to advance the prospects for stability and peace throughout the world. And we went to illustrate, by our presence, our sincere desire for good relations. We went to meet again with the Chinese and review our concerns and our differences. And we went to China to further define our own two countries' relationshipand, by defining it, advance it.","And I feel that we have progress to report. I had long and thoughtful meetings with the Chinese leadership, comprehensive meetings. We each listened carefully to what the other had to say. We discussed and agreed to cooperate more closely in the areas of trade, investment, technology, and exchanges of scientific and managerial expertise. We concluded an important agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We agreed that in this imperfect world, peace in its most perfect form cannot always be reachedbut it must always be our goal. And we, the people of China and the United States, must make our best efforts to bring greater harmony between our two countries.","It's a good thing for the world when those who are not allies remain open to each other. And it's good to remember that competitors sometimes have mutual interests, and those interests can make them friends.","I told the Chinese leaders, as I told the students at Shanghai University yesterday, that we must continue to acknowledge our differences, for a friendship based on fiction will not long withstand the rigors of the world. But we agreed that there is much to be gained from mutual respect. And there's much to be gained on both sides from expanded opportunities in trade and commerce and cultural relations.","I was heartened by some of the things that we saw. The Chinese have begun opening up their economy, allowing more farmers and workers to keep and sell on their own some of the fruits of their labor. The first injection of free market spirit has already enlivened the Chinese economy. I believe it has also made a contribution to human happiness in China and opened the way to a more just society.","Yesterday, before we left, we sat in a Chinese home at one of the now-called townshipsthey were once called communes-the farm communes where they raise the foodstuffs for all of China, but now there is a difference. They owe a portion of what they produce to the government, but then over and above that they can produce on their own and sell in a free marketplace. And in this home, it was most interesting. This young couple, their little son, his mother and father living with them, and he was telling us all the thingsand he built that home himself, and a very fine job it wasand then told us of how they're saving and what they're saving to buy next. It could have been in any home in America, talking about the problems of making ends meet and that they were saving for this or that for their future.","And I was also impressednot only by them but by all of the Chinese that we metby their curiosity about us. Many of the Chinese people still don't understand how our democracy works or what impels us as a people. So, I did something unusual. I tried to explain what America is and who we areto explain to them our faith in God and our love, our true love, for freedom. They'll never understand us until they understand that.","It was a breathtaking experience and in some ways, I think, a ground-breaking experience. But for us now, it's very fitting that we return home here to Alaskathe only one of our States that is equidistant to Asia and Washington, a westward facing State, and a State, may I say, from which we've received strong support.","When I was in Beijing, I explained to the Chinese that our attempt to build up our defenses, after more than a decade of almost constant neglect, is an attempt to preserve the peace and preserve freedom in the world. No one has helped us more in our efforts to rebuild our strength than the members of your Alaskan congressional delegation. And I thank them, as always, for their efforts and their good sense.","It's been good to talk to you and to see you and to be welcomed by you. Every time I come to Alaska I think of Robert Service, and I always threaten to recite \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" which I can do, believe it or not. But I won't subject you to it or those tired and bedraggled persons over theremy friends in the press. They've been working very hard the past 10 days to bring you at home the look and sound of China; and they're tired, so we'd like to give them a chance to rest. Maybe at the next press conference I'll recite it.","But it's wonderful to be here, and I thank you again for your very warm greetings. We'll take them with us tomorrow when we meet here in Fairbanks with a great man of peacePope John Paul II, who is also on his way to Asia, to South Korea. His continuing mission of peace is a service to all humanity, and I look forward to seeing and having a few moments with him again, as we had once before in Rome.","But again, God bless you all. It's just wonderful to be here, to see you all again. And all I can say, as far as Nancy and I are concerned, we'll be back."]}

The Sun always shines in Pennsylvania.","They came here in the snows of winter over a trail marked with the blood of their rag-bound feet. The iron forge that gave this place its name had been destroyed by the British when General Washington and his ragged Continental Army encamped here exhausted, outnumbered, and short of everything except faith.","We gather here today, the 200th anniversary of our independence, to commemorate their sacrifices even before we celebrate the glorious Declaration. Americans will remember the name of Valley Forge as long as the spirit of sacrifice lives within their hearts.","Here the vein of iron in our national character was forged. In the 18th century the colonial American was far more free and far more prosperous than his European cousin. Englishmen regarded us with some envy as appropriate subjects to share their grinding tax burdens.","After Concord Bridge and Breed's Hill, the British generals were impressed with our marksmanship and fighting spirit, but they still dismissed Washington's militiamen as a rabble of arms.","Many years later, when he was 91, a veteran of Concord was interviewed and asked why he took up his rifle against his King. Did he feel intolerably oppressed? \"No, never paid a penny for one of them stamps, never drank any tea, never heard of Locke. Only read the Bible and the Almanac.\"","Well, then, what did all the fighting mean? \"Young man,\" the aging revolutionary said very firmly, \"what we meant in going for those Redcoats was this: We had always governed ourselves, and we always meant to. They didn't mean that we should.\"","Without Jefferson's eloquence, those are the words of the American people's Declaration of Independence. That was the straight talk that brought some 11,000 ordinary Americans farmers, workers, tradesmen, and shopkeepers-into this valley of sacrifice in the bitter winter of 1777. Uncounted hundreds were never to leave.","They did not die amid the banners and the fearful sounds of battle. They weakened slowly and quietly succumbed to cold, sickness, and starvation. Yet their courage and suffering those who survived as well as those who fell-were no less meaningful than the sacrifices of those who manned the battlements of Boston and scaled the parapets of Yorktown.","In the battle against despair, Washington and his men kept freedom's lonely vigil. The leader and the led drew strength and hope from one another. Around the winter campfires that dotted these fields, the flame of liberty was somehow kept burning.","Something happened at Valley Forge. That ragged, starving Army here emerged and changed in a way that can be sensed but never fully described. They suffered, they trained, they toughened, they buried their dead, and they stayed. They stuck it out. When spring melted the snows and green returned to this beautiful countryside, a proud and disciplined fighting force marched out of this valley to victory, into the pages of history, unaware of the greatness they had done and oblivious of our gratitude.","As Abraham Lincoln noted long afterwards at another sacred site in Pennsylvania, nothing we can say here today can further consecrate or hallow this ground. But we can rededicate ourselves to the spirit of sacrifice shown at Valley Forge, Gettysburg, the Argonne Forest, Anzio Beach, and Iwo Jima.","Not all sacrifices are made in war. There are also sacrifices of peace. The sturdy wagon trains that have returned here, the wonderful people who drove them, and those along the way who rededicated themselves to the great principles of the Declaration of Independence offer heartwarming proof that our American adventure has just begun.","Our Bicentennial is the happy birthday of all 50 States, a commonwealth, and self-governing territories. It is not just a celebration for the original Thirteen Colonies. Americans are one people, and we can still hear them saying, \"We have always governed ourselves, and we always mean to.\"","The earliest English settlers carried the Bible and Blackstone's Commentary across the Atlantic among their few cherished possessions and established their own stir-governments on a strange and hostile coast. American families in prairie schooners like these took with them on the overland trails the principles of equality and the God-given rights of the Declaration of Independence.","Their restless search for a better life was begun in the spirit of adventure, but it was the spirit of sacrifice that sustained them. They suffered cruel winters, savage attacks, blazing deserts, and bloody feet. Many were buried beside the trail, but many stuck it out, dug in, and built permanent settlements where women stood the same sentry duty as the men. In the West, the Declaration's promise of legal and political equality for women was first broadened.","The American pioneers knew that in their wilderness homes they could not be colonials ruled by a distant government. They had assurance that in due course they could govern themselves as full citizens of equal States. This political guarantee made all the risks and all the sacrifices worthwhile. Their children and future generations would have all the rights of Washington, Jackson, and Lincoln. So do we, and more so.","As we continue our American adventure, the patriots of Valley Forge and the pioneers of the American frontier indeed, all our heroes and heroines of war and peace send us this single, urgent message: Though prosperity is a good thing, though compassionate charity is a good thing, though institutional reform is a good thing, a nation survives only so long as the spirit of sacrifice and self-discipline is strong within its people.","Independence has to be defended as well as declared. Freedom is always worth fighting for, and liberty ultimately belongs to those willing to suffer for it.","If we remember this, we can bring health where there is disease, peace where there is strife, progress where there is poverty and want. And when our Tricentennial celebration rolls around 100 years from now, grateful Americans will come to this shrine of quiet valor, this forge of our Republic's iron core.","Thank you very much."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkswallstreetprojectconferencereceptionnewyorkcity","text":["Well, first let me thank Reverend Jackson. And Jackie, thank you. And Dick Grasso, thank you for having all of us here tonight. This is the first time I have ever spoken from this microphone. You know, as [SPEAKER], I'm superstitious, and we've had such a good stock market. I don't ever comment on it except I like the way it finished today.","I wanted to say just a couple of things very briefly. First of all, I want to thank Dick Grasso for his leadership in the Wall Street Project. A lot of people don't know that the stock market was organized over 200 years ago so that there would be a mechanism through which bonds could be issued to finance America's debts in the war for our independence. So, in the beginning, this stock market had not just a profit motive but a public interest purpose. This man has infused the stock market not only with its greatest success in history but with a public interest purpose, to include all Americans in our prosperity. And we thank him.","Most of you were with us today in the afternoon, and I won't make you sit through my speech againor stand through my speech again, even though I'd kind of like to, because this is the first crowd in a long time when I've been guaranteed a standing ovation.","I just want to make two points. One, I want to thank Jesse Jackson for being there on this issue for a long time, saying we would never be the country we ought to be until we really had economic opportunity for allthat's what the Wall Street Project is all aboutand that it would be good business, as well as good morality.","The second point I want to make, that I made today and I leave with all of you is, this is the only time in my lifetime we have had a booming economy, improvements in all of our social fabric, the absence of crisis at home and domestic threats, and the absence of threats to our security around the world as big as those we faced in the cold war. None of this has ever happened before. The big question before us is, what are we going to do with this magic moment? Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things that America needs, or are we going to indulge ourselves in shortsighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and stability around the world?","I'm just telling you, we will never be the country we ought to be until every person, including the people and places that have been left behind in this remarkable recovery, has a chance to live the American dream. We will never be as safe a country, as whole a country, the one America we ought to be, until everybody has a chance.","That's what the Wall Street Project is all about. That's what my new markets initiative is all about. And I want to implore you to use this millennial year of 2000 to ask all of our fellow Americans to think about those who could be a part of what we celebrate and thank God for every day, but aren't yet. If we make them a part of it, we'll really give a gift to our children and to the 21st century.","Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you. "]}

It's always good to see some old friends and have a chance to make new ones. And it's always a pleasure to be joined by two of the most important women in my life, Nancy and Maureen.","Well, it may be September, but here in Washington it's been plenty warm until just a couple of days ago. We turned this off just for this particular gathering. And these past few weeks, I guess we broke the record here for the length of a hot spell just a few days ago, before the reduction in temperature, and it reminded me when I was a kid of our minister one hot summer Sunday morning. And he said that he was going to keep his sermon short, and he didjust seven words. He said: \"If you think it's hot now, wait.\" Well, today I'll follow his example, though I may slip a few more in than seven.","But I'm sure you've heard of our plan to overhaul the Federal tax program. This is the most burning issue that's facing the American people, I think, in this decade. I'm going to be out on the stump all fall bringing our case for tax fairness and economic growth to the American people and rallying their support. I'll be in many of your States; indeed, in many of your communities. And I'll be looking for your help, because it's the grassroots level that our tax proposal will find the energy, determination, and willpower needed to topple the status quo. Status quothat's Latin for the mess we're in. And the present system is a mess.","As State legislators, you don't need to hear about the pleadings of lobbyists, and the siren songs of special interests are heard in every legislative hall from Capitol Hill out through all the 50 States. But this time we can work for the special interests of all the American people to create a fair and equitable tax system, one which will be a double boon to the economy because it'll both close wasteful loopholes and, at the same time, cut tax rates. It's time for Americans to take their money out of tax shelters and invest the money in America's future. Every day we live with the present tax code, we're slowing down economic growth, sacrificing jobs that would have been created, unfairly burdening families, and perpetuating an unjust system that only breeds cynicism and resentment in the American people.","You know, last week I spoke about tax reform at North Carolina State University. And talking to those college students brought home to me the urgency of this issue. The room was electrified with their hope and energy and enthusiasm. Believe me, having served as a Governor during the time of the Vietnam riots and all, when, if I went to a campus, they'd burn down a buildingto see these young people today has just made me sureand I'm glad to tell youthe 21st century's going to be in good hands. And one of our proudest accomplishments as Republicans is the way we've been able to draw more and more young people into our ranks.","We've swept aside the pessimism and resignation that gripped the elected leadership of this country not too long ago, and we've opened our doors to the future. Like the American people themselves, we Republicans believe that America is still young, still vital, and still strong. What we've accomplished together goes beyond words. We've backed our words with decisive and dramatic action. Our 25-percent across-the-board tax reduction gave new life and sustenance to a spirit of optimism. An entrepreneurial renaissance is spreading across our land. A powerful economic expansion is lifting America out of the devastation of a decade of high tax policies and enabling us to build on a solid base of noninflationary growth.","Here's a piece of especially good news. The Democratically controlled House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families rated all the different tax plans that are presently floating around up there on the Hill and found that ours was by far the most profamily of all of the tax proposals. By raising the standard deduction to $4,000 for a married couple filing jointly and nearly doubling the personal exemption to $2,000, we'll make it so that a family of four doesn't pay one penny in Federal income tax on the first $12,000 of earnings. We're also giving nonwage-earning spouses equal access to IRA's, those tax deductible savings accounts. Someone's got to be very brave to suggest that a homemaker is not working. But alongside the pension reform passed in the last Congress, this will go a long way toward alleviating poverty by allowing women the means to care for themselves in retirement years.","Another report may be of special interest to you as State legislators. Our proposal to eliminate the State and local tax deduction has been getting a lot of flack from some quarters. Well, it turns out that the New York State government has a study by its own comptroller. It found that under our proposal, taxpayers in New York would save $588 million a year. So, that's the point. If the individual taxpayers in your States benefit, your States and localities as a whole benefit. There's no logic to fighting tax fairness, to fighting a plan that would increase economic growth, create more jobs, give families a much-needed break, and take the working poor off the tax rolls completely.","Of course, we still have a job to do in Congress getting spending under control. In that regard, on the revenue side, I'd like it known that I could immediately deposit $1.2 billion in cash in the Treasury if Congress will support this administration's decision to sell Conrail back to the private sector, where it belongs. I was only a small boy the first time the Federal Government tried to run the railroads. That was during World War I, and it was a disaster. If the war had gone on a little longer, I don't think we'd have had any trains left. So, we have an offer of that amount already. We can sell, if they'll only give the word. As Everett Dirksen might have said, \"A billion here and a billion there and pretty soon you're talking real money.\" Some in Congress seem to think they can proceed as usual, indiscriminately spending taxpayer dollars, and that sooner or later they'll all be bailed out with a tax hike. Well, for at least 31/2 years they won't. There'll be no tax hike on my watch.","We Republicans have always looked for the long-range solutions, and this tax plan is one of those which will be working long after we've left office. As State legislators, you know that programs closer to home are more cost-efficient, better planned, and offer more assistance. But the gluttonous Federal tax system has robbed you of the base for local programs. We must continue to move this wheel of government in the interest of what's right for America. And this is the time for which all of us have worked, the moment in which we can build a partnership between the levels of government with a growing economy to give America the momentum for the next century. And, my friends, I'm convinced that together we can succeed.","And now I'm going toyou know, in the business I was always in, you wanted a tag line to get off that would be popular- appreciated. It is, we're going to have dessert now. "]}

And I commend all of you individually for your wonderful work in helping our rural communities. It's gratifying to me to see young people like yourselves volunteering your time to keep these communities strong. And everything you've done, including OPERATION: Care and Share and working with local churches and various groups and other private sector initiatives, is indispensable to the future of our farm communities.","I want you to know that I've been thinking about the problems of the farm these past few years. In fact, we're, all of us here in this big house, constantly concerned about the challenges faced by American farmers during these difficult days. We're a farming nation. We always have been. The American farmer not only feeds this country that is 238 million strong, the American farmer feeds the world. And so when we contemplate the problems farmers are facing these days, we realize that we are dealing with a problem that speaks to the heart of how America lives and what America is.","A while back I received a letter from a daughter of a farmer in Louisiana. She wrote of how she remembered her father-up at last light, no time for breakfast, out milking the cows, gathering eggs, feeding the dogs. She spoke of how always in a farmer's day something will break down, and her father would have to fix it. And then he would hit the fields with the tractor and the earth tiller, and he wouldn't mind because \"a farmer is part of the ground he works.\" But she ended it with these words addressed to all: \"Don't you think it is time to say thanks to the farmer? After all, you stick your feet under his table every day.\" Well, those are wonderful words, and they shine with truth. But we do thank the farmer. And when you go home, will you tell your parents how we feel?","We've been trying to encourage a national farm bill that will help the farmer and ensure that you have a future in farming by making American agriculture more competitive. We want to put the agriculture industry on a firm and sound basis once and for all so that by the time you're ready to own and work a farm, you can count on being part of a strong and vibrant industry. And my great hope for you, for those of you who do aspire to farm for a living, is that you will be as wonderful as your parents are those people who are feeding a great nation and the world. They are the mainstay, the backbone of a great country. And I've got a little special place in my heart that's devoted to them alone.","It's been wonderful to have you here, and I thank you all for coming. I'd like to just add something here. You know, about 135 years ago a Frenchman came to this country because this country had already become the great economic powerhouse that it has continued to be. His name was Alexis de Tocqueville, and he toured all over this country, as he said, looking for the secret of our greatness. And he told some wonderful things. We are pretty unique in all the world with things like you, yourselves, are doing volunteer programs where people set out to help others, to help their neighbors. It's pretty traditionally American. And he described it as how, he said, a man would see a problem, and he wouldn't call the Government. He'd cross the street and talk to a friend, and pretty soon a committee would be formed. And, he said, they would solve the problem. And then in his book to his own countrymen in France, he said, and you won't believe this, but there wouldn't be a bureaucracy involved at any time in solving that problem. But he found the secret of America, and he also put this in his book. He said he had looked in the busy harbors; he'd looked in our industrial cities; he'd looked all over for the secret of our greatness. And then he said he looked in our churches, and he heard our pulpits aflame with righteousness. And he said America is great because America is good. And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.","Well, I've taken more than my time here because I've got to get in Marine One out there on the South Lawn in just a few minutes and head off for New Hampshire with some of our people and talk to the people up there. And you are all invited to go on over there and you girls, it will kind of blow your hairdos a little bit when we take off.

Thirteen years since the peace of an American morning was broken. Thirteen years since nearly 3,000 beautiful lives were taken from us, including 125 men and women serving here at the Pentagon. Thirteen years of moments they would have shared with us. Thirteen years of memories they would have made.","Here, once more, we pray for the souls of those we remember, for you, their families, who love them forever, and for a nation that has been inspired by your example: your determination to carry on, your resolve to live lives worthy of their memories.","As Americans, we draw strength from you. For your love is the ultimate rebuke to the hatred of those who attacked us that bright, blue morning. They sought to do more than bring down buildings or murder our people. They sought to break our spirit and to prove to the world that their power to destroy was greater than our power to persevere and to build. But you, and America, proved them wrong.","America endures in the strength of your families who, through your anguish, kept living. You have kept alive a love that no act of terror can ever extinguish. You, their sons and daughters, are growing into extraordinary young men and women they knew you could be.

And we give thanks to those who serve in harm's way to keep our country safe and meet the threats of our time. America endures in that perennial optimism that defines us as a people. Beginning tomorrow, there will be teenagers young adults who were born after 9/11. It's remarkable. And while these young Americans did not know the horrors of that day, their lives have been shaped by all the days since, a time that has brought us pain, but also taught us endurance and strength; a time of rebuilding, of resilience, and of renewal. What gives us hope what gives me hope is that it is these young Americans who will shape all the days to come.","Thirteen years after small and hateful minds conspired to break us, America stands tall and America stands proud. And guided by the values that sustain us, we will only grow stronger. Generations from now, Americans will still fill our parks, our stadiums, our cities. Generations from now, Americans will still build towers that reach toward the heavens, still serve in Embassies that stand for freedom around the world, still wear the uniform and give meaning to those words written two centuries ago: land of the free, home of the brave.

And when I was elected [SPEAKER], my major purpose in dealing with Federal Government agencies that relate to energy or to environment, to the quality of life in every way, was one of appointing people in whom I had complete confidence and, also, who had the confidence of those intensely committed environmentalists and conservationists in our country.","At the same time, of course, in order for us to be effective, there must be a working relationship that cannot create insuperable barriers between those who are interested in development of jobs on the one hand, those who want to protect the quality of the outdoors, the purity of life on the other. I think that we've been successful so far, without abridging anyone's deep commitment and integrity in past statements and beliefs on the one hand, and adequate progress on the other.","And I'm very proud this afternoon to have a chance to introduce these men and women who will be serving in such important positions.","Charles Warren is a man whom I first met when I was in Plains being briefed on the major questions concerning energy. He's a person who has been very effective in California, in the legislature, in devising and drafting and implementing major and very innovative decisions concerning the energy question, environmental questions, protection of the coastal regions, not only from a present-day point of view but as they would impact on the lives of people in years to come.","He's a very successful man there. And I think at some considerable sacrifice to himself, financially, but because of his interest in this subject, he's agreed to come and serve with us. And he'll be the Chairman of those who will advise me on matters that relate to environmental quality.","I'm very glad that you've come to be with us. And I express my appreciation to you and look forward to working closely with you.","Among my closest friends in the world are two people who mean a lot to me, and I think in the past and in the future will mean a lot to our country. One of them is Dr. Peter Bourne, who helped me in Georgia to set up one of the finest drug treatment programs in the Nation. He's recognized as the foremost expert on alcoholism, drugs, their impact, and the way to control them properly. His wife, Mary King, is also one who has been very close to me. When I was campaigning for [SPEAKER], whenever I came to Washington, not having enough support or finances to afford a hotel room, I always slept on their folding bed and they always took me in.","And I'm very excited to know that Mary King, who is an expert on health care in all its forms, on the proper utilization of volunteer Americans, who has a sensitivity and a courage that's absolutely superlative, is willing to serve in an agency that will spread this kind of knowledge throughout the world.","The ACTION program is one that's involved with the Peace Corps, with VISTA, and with the recruitment and use of Americans--sometimes outside Government itself--who are willing to serve this country and other nations who are friends of ours.","I'm very grateful that Mary King is going to be the Deputy Director of ACTION. And when I asked her to serve, she said that she would do it if I would be present at her swearing-in ceremony. Nothing could have kept me away. Mary, I'm very proud of you. And I know this is going to be a great experience for you and for me both.","Another very crucial agency, as you know, is the Environmental Protection Agency. This is one that, in a practical way, administers the laws evolved by the Congress and the President to make sure that the agencies of Government and business world, as well, are oriented toward the protection of the quality of life. There are many aspects of it: environmental impact statements, enforcement of quality of air and water.","And this requires men and women in administrative positions who are knowledgeable about law, who are thoroughly familiar with the rules that have been laid down in an administrative way, and who can deal with forcefulness and understanding with the State and local governments and with private industry to make sure that in the face of progress, which is inevitable, that we don't destroy what's precious to us.","Doug Costle has had broad experience in this field and will be the Director of this agency, and another very close friend of mine, Barbara Blum, who helped me get many of the Georgia laws passed against formidable opposition because of her courage and tenacity and because of her knowledge of environmental questions while I was Governor of Georgia.","And I'm very grateful that they are willing to serve as the two top leaders in this important agency, the Environmental Protection Agency. It's with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome them into the Government circles, and it's also with a great deal of pleasure that I thank them for being willing to serve.","This is going to be a competent, dedicated, courageous, tough partnership. And I believe that the people of our country can rest assured that in the years to come, that our quality of life will never be abridged nor will it deteriorate. And I hope that we can set a standard in this country that will be emulated by other nations around the world as we deal with kind of an unexplored opportunity to protect the things that are precious to us. So, I am thankful to all of you for being willing to serve with us.","Judge, thank you very much."," "]}

Of course, I want to start my remarks by extending to all of you the President's apologies for not being present at lunch today. This meeting was to be a high point of his trip. I'm sure you all know as well of his great respect and warm feelings for former Prime Minister Kaifu. And it is with real regret that he was not able to be here at lunchtime today.","As Prime Minister Kaifu said, the President is fine. I talked to his doctor just an hour ago. The doctor is a former classmate of mine at college. I know him very well, so I can assure you the information is correct. The doctor has told the President in very strict terms to rest this morning. He will be resuming his schedule later today and, I'm sure, will express to all of you his deep regret at not being able to join you at this wonderful gathering.","Mr. Prime Minister, members of the Diet, distinguished guests, it is a deep honor to be here today. [SPEAKER] has asked me to make his remarks to you this afternoon. Although there have been minor grammatical changes in pronouns, this is the [SPEAKER] speech. These are his words.","We come to Japan at the culmination of a long and productive journey. Today we stand at a turning point in history. The cold war is over. The Soviet Union has vanished and with it the delusions of communism. Centuries-old enemies in the Middle East are tempering ancient hatreds in pursuit of peace. Freedom's phoenix is rising from the ashes of tyranny in nations from Latin America to Eastern Europe and from Cambodia to Mongolia.","Freedom's rebirth was painful, its triumphs inscribed in blood, its truce seared by the fires of war and sacrifice. This century has taught us two crucial lessons: First, that isolationism and protectionism lead to war and deprivation; and second, that political engagement and open trade lead to peace and prosperity.","These last few years we again learned of the power of ideas. Technologies that transmit ideas in the blink of an eye carry the human spirit over barricades and through barbed wire. They hurdle walls designed to hold back the truth. We live in a world transformed, shrunken by swift travel and instant communication, drawn closer by common interests and ambitions, propelled forward by people's imaginations and dreams.","As leaders of this transforming world, the United States and Japan must help build a new international order based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and political and economic liberty. We must shape a world enriched by open trade and robust competition, a world that will create a better life for people of all nations.","The United States lies between two great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific. We are a nation of the Atlantic by birth, but our ties to the Asia-Pacific region deepen daily. Our two-way trade is now $310 billion annually, one-third larger than that with Europe. Our prosperity and yours are indivisible. American businesses cannot flourish in Asia unless the economies of Asia thrive and grow.","At the same time, Japan's growth needs American markets open and growing. Since 1975, the number of Americans of Asian origin has nearly quadrupled. What happens here is very important to us. And at the core of our continuing Asian engagement stands our alliance with Japan.","At each stop during his visit to the region, the President has stressed the challenges we must face, addressing the new security requirements of our transforming world, promoting democracy, and generating world economic growth and prosperity. Let me expand upon that by focusing on the special relationship that the United States enjoys with Japan. Rarely in history have two nations with such different and differing historic cultural roots developed such an extraordinary relationship. Our people are bound by shared security, by democracy, and by our deep economic ties.","There are those who doubt the future of this relationship. There are reasons for tension. Here in Japan you have a saying, \"Some rain must fall to prepare the ground for building.\" We can all see that without progress we may be in for some rough weather. And I must be frank in saying that there are problems in our economic relationship. Speaking not only for the United States but for many developed countries, Japan's trade surplus is too high, and its market access too restricted.","President Bush has come to Japan as a friend, seeking solutions to these concerns, believing that the expansion of free and fair trade will do nothing but strengthen our relationship. We in the United States are confident about our capacity for partnership. Our areas of common interest are too important. Consider the four key areas of our joint relationship.","First, the U.S.-Japan security alliance. We enjoy a strong security bond with Japan. Japan's generous host-nation support for U.S. forces stationed here is an important demonstration of shared responsibilities. Let us make the most efficient use of our defense resources by building greater coordination of our military forces and by promoting the two-way flow of defense technology. Such cooperation enhances our security and builds even stronger political ties between us.","The Gulf crisis sparked spirited debate here about Japan's global role. That makes it all the more profound that no nation outside the Gulf region provided more generous financial support than did Japan. The American people and peace-loving people everywhere appreciate deeply your contribution, Japan's contribution, to the United Nations coalition in the Gulf.","Even before the Gulf war, but especially in its aftermath, Japan has continued to define its growing role in world affairs. An increasingly active, engaged, and responsible Japan is critical to a forward-looking post-cold-war community. That community will not exist unless its leading powers lead.","This brings us to the second area of our relationship, our foreign policy cooperation. We must fulfill the bright promise of our global partnership. Together, we produce 40 percent of the world's gross national product. We contribute together 40 percent of all bilateral aid. We have the ability to marshal unrivaled resources to build a better future if our foreign policies are well coordinated.","America has a responsibility here, but it is a responsibility we share with Japan. The upcoming conference on assistance to the nations of the former U.S.S.R., now the Commonwealth of Independent States, is a timely example of such foreign policy coordination.","The collapse of the Soviet Union has also spurred questions within Japan about the durability of U.S.-Japan alliance. For decades, this alliance has stood as the bulwark of American-Japanese international cooperation. It is today every bit the linchpin of regional stability and bilateral cooperation that wise men foresaw years ago.","The demise of the Soviet Union may confront us both with ominous dangers, but it also presents us an historic opportunity. The leadership Japan and other Asian nations can provide to help transform a once-totalitarian empire into market-oriented and democratic states helps guarantee the future peace and stability of our world.","Let me add that with the changes in the former Soviet Union, the United States sees no reason why Japan should not regain the Northern Territories. We share this goal, and in whatever way we can, we will help you attain it.","We cannot imagine meeting the foreign policy challenges of our time without Japan as a partner. That is why today Prime Minister Miyazawa and President Bush will issue a document called the Tokyo Declaration, setting out the basic principles and major challenges of our global partnership. By putting into words the fundamentals of the two great partners, we hope to guide the way through the turbulent waters ahead. We must be clear about our responsibilities and our requirements, for our renewed alliance will do much to define the shape of the post-cold-war world.","Third, we must deepen our understanding of each other. For all of our interaction politically and economically, our peoples know too little of the other's history, traditions, and language. We welcome the work of the Center for Global Partnership in expanding exchanges and interactions, intellectual, scientific, and cultural. Thanks to such programs, our two nations will have an ever-increasing number of people who have lived in each other's country, speak each other's language, and understand more fully how important we are to each other.","Although more than 200,000 Asian students now study in American colleges and universities, more Americans must immerse themselves in Asian societies and cultures.","As the exchange of free people and ideas flows between our nations and as the cold war ends in victory for our cause, our economic relations have taken center stage. This brings me to the fourth and most important point.","If we are to expand our economic ties, we must face up to the economic tensions that threaten our relations. We must reduce those tensions now by opening markets and by eliminating barriers to trade and investment. We are now each other's largest overseas trading partner. Japan will sell about $90 billion worth of goods and services to the United States this year. We will sell nearly $50 billion to Japan.","Our economies, the world's two largest and most technologically advanced, have become irreversibly intertwined. Closing markets and restricting trade have previously brought the world to the brink of economic disorder. Isolation and protectionism must remain the sleeping ghosts of the past, not the waking nightmares of the future. We must reject these failed notions in the sure knowledge that expanding markets mean expanding jobs and increasing prosperity for both our countries.","We must ensure a continued strong two-way economic relationship between Japan and the United States, with markets more open to new goods and services, manufacturers more open to new competitive ideas, the financial services industry competing on a fair basis, and an equitable flow of technology on both sides.","Our two countries share a special responsibility to strengthen the world economy. Yesterday the President and the Prime Minister announced a strategy for world growth which commits both our countries to domestic policies to stimulate growth. Expanded domestic demand in Japan translates into additional exports to Japan for American products and jobs at home. And we are seeking broad support for growth policies among other industrialized countries as well.","Many American businesses learned during the past decade that the old ways no longer work in our changing international marketplace. Our companies have cut costs, improved quality, and championed innovation. As a result, our products sell in markets everywhere they have access. And candidly, such access is still limited in Japan.","We must reduce the trade imbalance between us, not through managed trade, through gimmicks or artificial devices, but simply by gaining true and welcome access to your markets. We want to create fair opportunities for traders and investors, both buyers and sellers, by removing the barriers both seen and unseen to open and equitable trade.","American business doesn't need a handout and doesn't want one. Some say that perhaps it is time to help the United States out of a sense of pity or compassion. Let me tell you, we are looking for no such help. What the United States wants from Japan is for Japan to recognize its international economic responsibility for its own sake and for the sake of the global marketplace upon which Japan depends. When we express appreciation to those who seek to open Japanese markets, it is not because we need a handout but because we know an open Japan is good for us all.","Our companies simply expect the chance to compete fairly in markets around the world. Our Government remains committed to open markets, and we will further reduce our own trade barriers as our friends dismantle their own.","Our two countries have embarked on a unique experiment in economic independence called the Structural Impediments Initiative. In this effort, each side pinpoints the other's barriers to competitiveness, and each commits to reduce them. We both must reinvigorate this commitment to market access, whether for high quality American products or quality American services. The beneficiaries will be the workers and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.","Improving our economic relations includes further opening your markets. It means greater openness in many sectors of the Japanese economy still biased against outside investment. These practices hurt American companies, but they also hurt Japanese consumers.","Americans want the same things you want, a better quality of life for themselves and their families. Americans never say, \"Please raise our prices.\" And I'll bet the Japanese don't either. Every worker is also a consumer, and economic competition brings them great choices and lower prices. In fact, the Toys-R-Us store that the President visited in Kyoto offers prices up to 30 percent lower than its Japanese competition. The stunning success of the consumers' response to its sister store north of Tokyo tells the same story. That's good for us, and it's good for you.","U.S. export business is stronger than ever. We sold more exports last year than ever before. We enjoy a trade surplus with Europe. About one-third of our economic growth between 1985 and 1990 was attributable to merchandise exports. To Japan, our manufactured exports are up 70 percent since 1987, a $20 billion increase that represents almost half a million jobs.","Still the overall trade deficit with Japan remains large. And I might add, its persistence is truly the exception among our trading partners. Let me say this: We have waited a long time, but now the time has come for equal access. Fairplay is in both our interests.","As you know, the United States and Japan also face the urgent challenge of leading the way to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round. Because of the benefits we each derive from free trade, Japan and the United States bear a special responsibility for tackling the remaining difficult issues quickly and decisively. The success of the round depends on bold, farsighted leadership. We must lift our gaze to the glimmering horizon of broader prosperity and not worry over the stones in our immediate path.","Yes, all of us have problems with portions of the so-called Dunkel draft, but we cannot let the progress it represents slip through our fingers. If we allow that draft to be picked apart by special interests, who wins? Not our people, not yours, not the less developed nations. No one. The GATT round is the world's best hope for expanding trade for all countries.","Men and women from all walks of life and all parts of America constantly tell the President this: They believe very, very strongly in creating a level playing field for everyone. We want all our trading partners to give the United States companies the same kind of opportunities that their firms enjoy in the United States. That's not just free trade; that's fair trade. And it creates a basis for even greater freedom and greater prosperity for all.","Many of our Japanese friends argue that the United States must improve its competitiveness, and they're right. We recognize that some of our bilateral trade imbalance stems from causes other than restricted market access. One reason for Japan's competitiveness is because Japan has saved and invested at a rate double that of the United States. You have focused on applied research and development and new manufacturing technologies. Your companies have established fine quality control systems. You have developed a highly educated labor force and have taken the long view to develop markets abroad.","There is much for us to learn from you. We are taking steps to boost our competitiveness. We can and will increase our rate of savings and investment. We will continue to boost our manufacturing's excellence. We will reduce the budget deficit. To stimulate innovation, risk, and longer term business outlook, the President is pushing for investment incentives, R&D credits, and capital gains tax cuts. In America, cutting capital gains is politically extremely difficult. It would be easier if our politicians saw the positive effect on Japan's competitiveness due to low capital gains rates.","And America must raise its educational standards. Our America 2000 education strategy will fuel a revolution for better quality schools. This is another path to competitiveness. The education achievements of Japan and others in the Asia-Pacific region inspire us. That is why President Bush has invited the countries of the Pacific Rim to send their education ministers to Washington for a conference this spring to seek new ways to cooperate and to learn from each other's accomplishments.","With the President today, traveling with him, is a delegation of America's top business leaders. They've come to explore new business opportunities in all the nations the President has visited. Every one of them can tell you that despite the fact that our economy is facing some new tough times right now, America still draws upon tremendous strengths. Our basic research is the best anywhere. We have many of the world's finest universities. American technology remains on the cutting edge in many advanced fields such as computers and biotechnology. Our society is energetic, creative, and talented. It has the added advantage of drawing upon the strengths and insights of many cultures, including Japan's.","The chief executive officers accompanying the President will also tell you that they care about American jobs. They care about American exports. Obviously, so does the President. We know that the Asian-Pacific market offers enormous potential to those American businesses that will accept the challenge of competition. That same competition has propelled Japan toward world leadership. Open markets around the world has provided Japan with economic prominence. Japan must now join the ranks of world leadership in strengthening free markets and freedom.","Finally, let me leave with you a message that the President wished to give directly to the people of Japan. And I quote:","The American people are your friends. Friendship must be built upon three pillars: fairness, trust, and respect. We expect nothing less, and we ask for nothing more. Today marks a turning point for us in many ways. Together, we face the next millennium, a new order for the ages, a new world of freedom and democracy. We stand as the world's powers with the future presenting us with a decision. The United States has made its choice against isolationism and in favor of engagement, against protectionism and for expanding trade. Today we bid Japan to do the same because engagement and open trade are in your best interest.","Together, let us shape a new and open world, a world of vigorous competition and dazzling innovation. Let us build a world of greater prosperity and peace than ever before, if not for the sake of ourselves, then for the sake of our children. This is the finest legacy that we could bequeath to them.","Thank you very much."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress121","text":["Good morning. Today I want to talk to you about our Nation's duty to ensure that all America's seniors can enjoy their golden years as healthy as modern medicine will allow. I want to talk about my plan to strengthen and modernize Medicare and the important steps we can take to encourage older Americans to undergo health screenings that can save their lives and improve the quality of their lives.","For 34 years now, Medicare has been the cornerstone of our efforts to protect the health of the disabled and our seniors. Last month at the White House, I unveiled a fiscally responsible plan to secure and modernize this vital program for the 21st century. The plan will strengthen Medicare by controlling cost, promoting competition, and dedicating a significant portion of the budget surplus to keeping the Trust Fund solvent until the year 2027. And my plan will modernize Medicare by matching its benefits to the latest advances of modern medicine.","Since Medicare's founding in 1965, a medical revolution has transformed health care in America. Once the cure for many illnesses was a scalpel; now, just as likely, it's a pharmaceutical. That's why I made helping seniors afford the prescription drugs essential to modern medical care a key part of the Medicare plan.","But even as we modernize Medicare with the prescription drug benefit, we also must modernize Medicare's preventive care benefits. Today, doctors have new tools to detect and prevent diseases earlier and more effectively than ever. And for millions, early detection can mean the difference between a full recovery and a bleak prognosis. For instance, if prostate cancer is caught early, the survival rate is 99 percent; but if it isn't, the rate can be a discouraging 31 percent.","In 1997 we worked across party lines to expand Medicare coverage for preventive services. But too few seniors still are using this benefit. Last year just one in seven older women received a mammogram covered by Medicare. For many seniors on fixed incomes, who every day must struggle to pay for food, rent, and other necessities, the cost of even a modest copayment can be prohibitive, and that can cost lives.","It makes no sense for Medicare to put up roadblocks to screenings and then turn around and pick up the hospital bills its screenings might have avoided. No one should have to undergo a dangerous surgical procedure that could have been prevented by a simple test. No senior should have to hesitate to get the preventive care they need. That's why my plan will eliminate the deductible in all copayments for all preventive services, for cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other diseases.","And because 70 percent of beneficiaries still do not even know about all of Medicare's preventive services, we'll launch a nationwide campaign to inform and encourage seniors to take these tests. We'll keep looking into ways to improve preventive care for seniors, including strategies to help them stop smoking.","In the meantime, I call on older Americans to take advantage of the preventive benefits that already are available to you. They could save your life.","We must seize America's moment of prosperity to strengthen and modernize Medicare for the 21st century. There are some who propose spending our new budget surpluses on tax cuts. Well, I support tax cuts for retirement savings, for child care, for education, but it would be wrong to spend our hard-earned surplus on tax cuts before we first have honored our obligations to our seniors and to all our families in the 21st century. First things first.","I've invited leaders of both parties to meet with me at the White House on Monday to discuss the urgency of acting on Medicare now. We have an unprecedented opportunity to prepare Medicare and Social Security for the retirement of the baby boomers and to pay down our debt, to make America debt-free over the next 15 years. We can't let this opportunity slip away. Together, we can find a way to make this summer a true season of progress for all Americans.","Thanks for listening. "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress407","text":["Good morning. New Year's Day will soon be upon us, and with it will come New Year's resolutions. This weekend is a good time to give thanks for our blessings and to resolve to do better in the coming year.","One of our greatest blessings as Americans is that we live in a country with a growing economy, where people can pursue their dreams, turn ideas into enterprises, and provide for their families. It is a measure of our economy's resilience that even with high oil prices and softness in the housing market, we're still growing. In November, our economy added jobs for the 51st straight month, making this the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. Unemployment is a low 4.7 percent. Exports are up. And the fundamentals of our economy are strong.","Economic statistics are important indicators. Yet it is more important to remember that behind all these numbers are real people. These people include the entrepreneurs who live their dreams by starting up new businesses. These people include small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in our economy. And most of all, these people include the tens of millions of working moms and dads whose jobs provide for their families.","I know that even in this growing economy, some of you have real concerns. Some of you worry about your ability to afford health care coverage for your families. Some of you are concerned about meeting your monthly mortgage payments. Some of you worry about the impact of rising energy costs on fueling your cars and heating your homes. You expect your elected leaders in Washington to address these pressures on our economy and give you more options to help you deal with them. And I have put forth several proposals to do so.","In the last month, Congress has responded to some of my initiatives. They passed a good energy bill, they passed a temporary patch to protect middle class families from the burden of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and they passed a law that will help protect families from higher taxes when their lenders reduce their mortgage debt. But this is only a start. Congress needs to do more to decrease America's dependence on oil. Congress needs to pass legislation that will help make health care coverage more affordable for small businesses and workers who buy their own policies. And Congress needs to act quickly on the rest of my proposals to help families struggling with rising mortgage payments keep their homes.","Most of all, we need to set a good example in Washington by being careful with your money. I'm disappointed that leaders in Congress sent me a massive spending bill that includes about 9,800 earmarks. Earmarks are special interest items that are slipped into big spending bills like this one, often at the last hour, without discussion or debate. Among the earmarks Congress approved was one for a prison museum and another for a sailing school. In the last election, congressional leaders ran on a promise that they would reform earmarks. They made some progress, but not nearly enough. So my administration is reviewing options to address wasteful earmark spending.","As we address earmarks, we also must restrain spending, keep taxes low, and continue on a path towards a balanced budget. And that is what the budget I submit in February will do. You work hard for your money and to live within your means. As you provide for your families, the last thing you need is wasteful spending that will lead to a tax hike. My resolution for the New Year is this: to work with Congress to keep our economy growing, to keep your tax burden low, and to ensure that the money you send to Washington is spent wisely or not at all.","Thank you for listening, and happy New Year."]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsradioaddress527","text":["Good afternoon, my fellow Americans. On Wednesday night I will present my plan to generate jobs and increase the incomes of the American people. This morning I want to talk with you for a few moments about that program, its goals, and the thinking that went into it.","As I have traveled our country over the last year and a half, a single theme has emerged repeatedly from all of you in every region and from every walk of life. That theme is the need for change: bold, comprehensive change to reverse the trickle-down policies of the 1980's and restore the vitality of the American dream.","Over the last 12 years, while the middle class saw their tax burdens rise and their incomes go down, the wealthiest Americans, whose incomes went up, often by paperwork manipulation and moving jobs overseas, saw their taxes go down. Higher deficits came with lower taxes on the wealthy. And those deficits forced Government to cut back on essential services to the middle class, the working poor, and the neediest Americans. Good families in embattled neighborhoods saw their children getting by with outdated school books, going to school in neighborhoods that were ever more dangerous, while the wealthiest Americans in protected communities watched their bankbooks grow. Our economy suffered through two grinding recessions, and our job-creating engine stalled. The status quo simply isn't working for working families anymore.","The experts say we're in a robust economic recovery. And to be fair, there are some good signs: our best companies doing better, people being able to refinance their homes, and consumer confidence on the upswing since the election.","But the jobs just aren't there yet. The unemployment rate has been over 7 percent for 14 months now, and we're 3 million jobs behind where we ordinarily would be in a real economic recovery. That's why change is so important. And the risk of doing the same old thing is far higher than the cost of change. If we don't change, the American economy and the living standards of our broad middle class will continue to decline, and many of us and most of our children will not enjoy the standard of living that past Americans have.","Change is never easy. It requires us to forsake the old order and to embrace a new one. Change means asking everyone to pull his or her own weight for the common good. But change is our only choice.","Under my economic program, we will build an America where even the most privileged pay their fair share, not because we want to soak the rich but because we want to stop soaking the middle class and ask everybody to bear a fair share of the load; an America where the most impoverished move off welfare and go back to work; an America where middle class families who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded in their own lives and can pass on to their children a more prosperous future than they inherited from their parents; and yes, an America where Government is not immune from the sacrifices it asks of our people.","Just this week I cut the White House staff by 25 percent and saved $10 million compared to the budgets of my predecessors. I've ordered further administrative cuts in Federal departments and agencies of $9 billion over the next 4 years, with more to follow from tough and smart management.","I'm also ordering an investigation into the enormous cash bonuses paid to officials of the departing administration. In some cases it was done just minutes before I was sworn into office. While I deeply admire the dedicated members of our Federal services, we simply cannot have extravagant payments made to departing bureaucrats and political cronies at a time when most people are tightening their belts.","If Government is going to ask the American people to contribute, it must lead by example and learn to do more while spending less. That is a challenge I have embraced and one I will present to the Congress on Wednesday.","Next, we will take the battle to the special interests. We will demand that those who see the Tax Code as a table game to be won rather than a social compact to be respected pay their fair share of taxes. I will keep my pledge to restore fairness to the Tax Code. We will raise taxes on the wealthiest individuals and companies in our society. That will be one of their contributions to create the high-skill, high-wage economy that we seek. And I will say to the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the others who profit from the status quo, they must join our cause to make comprehensive reforms in our medical care system. The time has come for all Americans to have affordable health care, a real chance at a healthy life.","In return for these contributions, we are determined to create long-term, good-paying private sector jobs. We will encourage the development of new technologies and find markets for them all across America and around the word. We will provide special incentives to new businesses and small businesses to create the jobs of the future. We will lower their costs of capital so they can expand and succeed. We will upgrade the skills of the long-term unemployed and the rest of our work force. And when military cutbacks hurt our enterprises, we'll help defense workers to find new careers and to continue productive lives.","That's what my plan is all about: a leaner, more efficient, more responsive Government; a ladder of contribution that demands the most from those who have the most; investment incentives to help businesses build for the future and create jobs for all Americans; education and training to prepare workers and students for new jobs in a new economy; a reformed medical system that restores peace of mind to family life; an America where every citizen has a right to a prosperous economy and a shared patriotic stake in the work to make it grow.","That is a program for economic change you have justly demanded. Now it's time for all Americans to join the cause and embrace the change. It is time to restore the American dream.","Thank you, and God bless you."," "]}

There's much wisdom in these words from the Scriptures, \"Come, let us reason together.\" This week we've seen a good example of what happens when people talk to each other instead of shout at each other. And unfortunately, we've also seen what happens when some people go to unreasonable lengths to prevent reasonable discussion and decisionmaking.","I'm speaking to you from the Pacific Northwest where we've just concluded the Forest Conference. For years, the good people of the Northwest have been divided by a difficult argument over important values: how best to preserve jobs and protect the forests in this beautiful and productive region of our great Nation.","Yesterday in Portland, Oregon, timber workers, business people, environmentalists, and community leaders sat down together in a conference room, not a courtroom. We discussed how to achieve a healthy economy and a healthy environment. And I directed my Cabinet to come back within 60 days with a plan for a balanced policy.","Grass roots Americans want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving. They want to follow the same practice that we followed in Oregon yesterday. Unfortunately, some people in Washington, DC, haven't gotten the message that the people want fundamental change. Yesterday the minority party in the Senate used procedural tactics to prevent the entire Senate from voting on our jobs and economic recovery package, which has already been passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives.","Yesterday we also learned why our jobs package is even more urgent than ever. After 3 years, when America lost one million jobs in the private sector, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in March, and the total number of jobs in our economy actually declined. Now, some folks in Washington may think everything is fine, but all across America the people understand there won't be a real recovery until our working men and women can look forward to a secure, high-wage future for themselves and their children. The people know that America needs our plan to put 500,000 Americans back to work by beginning the investments we need in a stronger, smarter economy.","It's time to move beyond the old politics of partisanship, posturing, and procedural delays and start working together to solve problems. Good things can be accomplished when we reason together. And just as this works in our own country, so too can it work between ourselves and other nations.","That's why I'm taking my first trip out of the country today to meet with Russia's democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin. Nowhere is progress toward democracy and free markets more important to us than in Russia and the new independent states of the former Soviet Union. Their progress presents a great security challenge and offers great economic opportunities. Russia's rebirth is in the economic interests of American taxpayers, workers, and businesses and the security interests of all of us.","We spent over $4 trillion to wage the cold war. Now we can reduce that spending because the arms and armies of the former Soviet Union pose a greatly reduced threat to us and to our allies. If Russia were to revert to its old ways or plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess our plans for defense savings. That could mean less money for creating new businesses and new jobs, less for preparing our children for the future, less for education. Our economic program at home, more jobs and greater incomes for Americans, could be jeopardized if the reforms in Russia fail.","My discussions with President Yeltsin involve measures intended to help the Russian people make the difficult transition to a market economy by helping themselves. I want America to act, but America cannot and should not act alone. Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the Gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in Russia. Most of this effort will have to come from the Russian people themselves. They will chart the path to their own future. These efforts to offer an historic chance to improve our own security, however, require some action by ourselves, too.","Russia still holds over 20,000 strategic and tactical nuclear warheads. We are implementing historic arms control agreements that for the first time will actually reduce the level of strategic nuclear weapons. By supporting Russia's reforms we can help turn the promise of those agreements into reality for ourselves and for our children and for the Russian people and their children as well. And we can make life in America more safe and prosperous.","For too long, work in Washington on issues like economics, the environment, and foreign policy took place in isolation. The interests of the American people weren't amply protected because their voices weren't adequately heard. The change we want is this: to bring men and women of good will together so that we can put people, the American people, first. We need you to stay active and informed and involved.","Now, I ask you to call or write your Senators. Ask them to take action on our jobs and economic recovery package. I ask for your best wishes as I go into this meeting with President Yeltsin and your understanding that here there is no clear line between our interests at home and our interests abroad. We cannot withdraw from the world even as we work to make America stronger. Together we can change America and change the world.","Thank you for listening."," "]}
{"discourse_type":0,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsweeklyaddress308","text":["Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I talked about the idea of opportunity for all. Opportunity is the idea at the heart of this country: that no matter who you are or how you started out, with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead.","I'm even more passionate about it today. Because while our economy has been growing for 4 years and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead, and that's been true since long before the recession hit.","We've got to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out last week will help us do that.","It's an agenda with four parts. Number one, more new jobs. Number two, training folks with the skills to fill those jobs. Number three, guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that's there when you need it.","I want to work with Congress on this agenda wherever I can. But in this year of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, I will. I've got a pen, and I've got a phone: a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. And we've already begun.","In Wisconsin, I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In Pittsburgh, I directed the Treasury to create MyRA, a new way for working Americans even if you're not wealthy to start your own retirement savings.","In Maryland, I rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at the White House, I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they've been looking. And I directed the Federal Government to make hiring decisions the same way: based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job.","So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, that's what I mean. And I'm going to keep asking students and parents and business leaders to help, because there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, ready to move this country forward, and determined to restore the founding vision of opportunity for all.","That's what I'm all about. Thanks, have a great weekend. And to our Olympians in Sochi, go Team U.S.A.!"]}

I refer, of course, to the Federal Republic of Germany and to Harvard University.","Our guest is one of the few men in public life whose title, Doctor, was earned academically long before it was conferred by honorary degree.","Dr. Erhard, all Americans join in congratulating you upon the richly deserved honor that you have received and we are grateful that you honor us as our guest in this garden this evening. When the Chancellor was last in the United States, I expressed to him the hope that the dose relationship and the healthy friendship between our countries would grow in strength and in meaning. I am proud to say tonight that that hope has been the reality of the intervening half year.","It is evident to us that the relations between our countries have never been better than at this time tonight. Our understanding is deepening, our cooperation is broadening, our hopes for the future are rising. We have come forward together, your country and mine, along the path of insuring freedom and security in a world where both are constantly threatened.","German effort and foresight and determination and dedication along with those of our allies in Western Europe have made it possible to convert age-old rivalries into new and constructive relationships. Tonight our hopes rise from this foundation, the only real foundation that can support and sustain them, the foundation of strength.","We of the United States of America value highly this relationship with the Federal Republic of Germany. The ties between the people of America and the people of Germany are many and close. From the dark days of our Valley Forge to the bright age of mankind's exploration of space the cause of freedom has prospered when the peoples of our two countries have worked together in peace. Tonight we are working together as allies in NATO, tonight we are working together as friends in freedom, and tonight we are working together as partners in peace.","The road ahead is hard but hopeful. I have no doubt that Germany and the United States will continue to move along that road together surmounting the obstacles and serving the opportunities that we encounter together along that way. Our goal and our purpose is peace; peace with honor, peace with justice, peace under freedom. We shall not rest until that day is reached and until that dream is real. We seek to move only on a course of peace and justice, never a course of fear or hostility.","Together with our allies we shall work to open new avenues of trade and we shall work to build new bridges of ideas toward the East, to improve relations, to lessen tensions, to enhance the prospect of all of us living in this world in peace.","As we all recognize, there can be no real and lasting peace in Europe, or in the rest of the world for that matter, until Germany is united, united by self-determination in peace and in freedom. This can be done, and the people of the United States are determined that it shall be done to end the inequities and injustices of the division of the German people--until there is a unified Germany. Only the representative and democratic government of the Federal Republic of Germany can speak for the German people.","It is a very great honor and a very proud privilege, Mr. Chancellor, to have you in our midst this evening. The scene is a little different from our last meeting, the friendship is a little stronger.","I ask those of my friends who have come here this evening and our distinguished guests to join me in raising your glasses to the [INTERVIEWED] of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the friendship between the people of the United States and all the people of Germany always.","\"Mr. [INTERVIEWED], Mrs. Johnson, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:","\"First of all let me express my gratitude for the congratulations which you expressed to me on the occasion of the honor which was bestowed upon me yesterday when I was granted an honorary doctor's degree at Harvard. This in itself would be sufficient to make me very happy, very proud indeed.","\"But I was even more happy about this distinction and that honor because it afforded me an opportunity to come over again to the United States of America and to meet with you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to have new talks with you, exchange of views, exchange of hopes, exchange of worries and problems.","\"Some people said after our meeting in Texas at the end of last year that was, so to speak, the honeymoon between the two of us and they raised a warning voice saying, 'Well, let's wait until this period of the honeymoon is over; now everything is pleasant, everything is beautiful, but then they will be faced with the rough realities.'","\"I think the honeymoon is over now and today we have reached, if I may put it this way, the state of marriage, but based on trust, on faithfulness. I think these are the pillars of this relationship between the two of us.","\"Though our talks dealt with a number of very serious problems, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], today I had the impression that our personal friendship had deepened and was strengthened over the last 6 months. And if I speak of the personal relationship between the two of us, I would add that I am inclined to apply that also to the relationship between our two countries, our two nations.","\"As I look back over the period since I have been in political office, that means since the end of the last war, I think it was at that time unique, unique and unparalleled in world history, that the victor who had gained unimaginable strength and power through his victory showed such great generosity by helping all the countries of the world, including the vanquished, to reconstruct their countries. This was, as I said, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], a unique and unparalleled contribution. In this way you helped to secure the peace in the world.","\"I said to you this morning, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], when we had our conversation, I understood that your feelings were a bit bitter about the fact that so little gratitude was shown by the countries for what the United States has done after the last war. But such is human nature, one cannot expect gratefulness, and what one has received in the way of good deeds is very easily forgotten. But I am all. the more happy and pleased, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], to be able to say that these things are not forgotten in Germany. The German people will always remember what they have received from the United States of America, and this I feel is the basis of the friendship that exists between our two countries. That is the basis, the foundation, of the trust and confidence which enables genuine cooperation.","\"I think we have all the essential objectives in common; and even if there should be some misunderstanding, some differences from time to time, I think there can be no doubt whatsoever, neither here in the United States nor in the Federal Republic of Germany, that this friendship between our two countries is a firm one, that there is also this conviction that we have common tasks and common missions to fulfill. I am not so presumptuous to say that Germany could speak for Europe, but on the other hand I feel that the Federal Republic of Germany can be, must be the stabilizing factor, the stabilizing element, in Europe.","\"By our attitude we can show how necessary, how desirable it is for Europe to come closer to the United States and also to try and tie the United States of America, or let me put it this way, the North American Continent more closely to Europe. This I feel is our common fate and our common destiny.","\"We do not want to divide and to split up the world amongst ourselves, but though we ourselves in Germany, in our country, experience this tragic division and whatever it means, we want to make a contribution to overcome all these difficulties.","\"I hope, I am sure we will succeed--what we have in common is this hope on behalf and for all the world. Today we are trying to make our contribution to these common objectives. We feel this responsibility for the countries which are still in a somewhat backward and underdeveloped stage, or countries which still have to live in slavery.","On the other hand, we are grateful to you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to the United States of America for the understanding you have been showing for our particular German problem.","\"I have said on several occasions on this visit-I said it also today when I had the honor to address the Senate of the United States--that it would not be a good and a right alliance, it would not be real friendship, if each country were to look at its own interests only, were to look at the geographical area in which itself is situated and would not look beyond that. And it would be a bad alliance, it would be a bad friendship, if every partner were not ready also to stand up for the other partners.","\"We fully recognize the seriousness of your problems. I think of Cuba, I think in terms of South Viet-Nam, we consider them also to be our problems. We also feel an obligation, as you are understanding our particular situation in the Federal Republic of Germany, our particular problems, and I hope and I am sure that this is a good firm foundation of our friendship and cooperation. I think all that is divided today can be overcome. And where there is so much good will and deep and honest friendship I am absolutely convinced that this good relationship will continue between our two countries and that it will continue to be an element of freedom, of security, and of peace in the world.","\"Mr. [INTERVIEWED], today during our conversations we have assured one another of our mutual sympathy, and when I have done that I think it was more than a diplomatic phrase or a diplomatic formula. It was, so to speak, let me say that quite frankly, a human confession and I think it was understood in that way by the two of us. We are convinced that it is our common task, and I say that with all humility which is due to us Germans and which we must observe, I think this is a common task with which we are confronted. What we can do will be done gradually as a contribution towards peace, security, freedom, and liberty, and prosperity of all well meaning nations and countries in the world.","\"In conclusion, I propose a toast to you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], and to the health of Mrs. Johnson.","\"Thank you very much.\""]}

But we particularly want to honor and respect tonight two of our guests who are with us: Mrs. Dwight Eisenhower, whose husband was [SPEAKER] of the United States when the Congo was born--she came from Gettysburg and wanted to be here for this dinner tonight--and Justice Thurgood Marshall, who has had a very difficult time over these last few months in the hospital, but who has fully recovered and who attends his first White House dinner since that time. We are very happy to have him here.","Mr. [SPEAKER], since I came into office over 18 months ago, you are the youngest head of state to be honored in this room, and you represent the youngest nation. But though you are a young man and you come from a young nation, there are things we can learn from you.","Tomorrow I have a meeting scheduled with my Cabinet on the budget. I find in studying your administration that you not only have a balanced budget but a favorable balance of trade, and I'd like to know your secret before our meeting with the Cabinet.","This morning when I welcomed you on the South Lawn, I told our Americans listening on television that the Congo was a good investment. I would like to tell this very special group in this room why I consider the Democratic Republic of the Congo a good investment.","I could say it was a good investment because it is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of natural resources. But it has far more than that. It has, also, people who are able to develop that wealth if given the chance to do so.","In my visit to your country in 1967, I was impressed, of course, by my meeting with you and other government leaders. But I was impressed, too, when I visited a shipyard and the university and a factory and walked over the streets of Kinshasa, and I saw the people, working hard, strong, vigorous, vital and very proud-proud of their country, and with great dignity.","And when we combine rich natural resources with a strong, vigorous people, and a leader who is able to provide the stability and the vision for progress for that country, then that country is a good investment, a good investment for its own people or for others who may desire to participate in its growth.","I am sure that as we look back over the 10 years of the history of this country, we think of how time has capsuled in this century. We think of the fact, as we sit in this room with the great picture of Abraham Lincoln, the portrait, overlooking the room, that a war between our States occurred 100 years ago, and 100 years, virtually, after we were founded.","In 10 years the Congo was born, survived a civil war, and now is a strong, effective, and progressive leader in the exciting new continent, the new Continent of Africa.","An enormous amount of the credit for that development goes to its leaders and particularly to our honored guest tonight. I know that all Americans, as they think of the Congo, know that the [SPEAKER] has often referred to his country as being the heart of Africa. I think all of us at this table tonight would speak from our hearts to the heart of Africa when we raise our glasses to the health of the [SPEAKER] of the Congo and Mrs. Mobutu.","Note: The [SPEAKER] spoke at 9:55 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House.","[SPEAKER] Mobutu responded in French. A translation of his remarks follows:","Mr. [SPEAKER], Mrs. Nixon, ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests:","I followed very closely your brilliant presentation, Mr. [SPEAKER]. And now I should like to express on behalf of my wife and my delegation and in the name of my people-what I should like to say here tonight, Mr. [SPEAKER], publicly, is, first of all, all our thanks to your country for everything that you have done for my country for more than the last 10 years.","This morning in response to your kind words of welcome, and at the State Department in response to Secretary Rogers' toast, I said this very forcefully, that in coming here I was bringing the message of gratitude and friendship to the American people, and I said to Secretary Rogers that we have a saying in the Congo that it is in adversity that you know your friends.","My country, beset with problems and difficulties from 1960 to 1965, my country had added a word to the international vocabulary. That word was Congollzation. To \"Congolize\" was to spread chaos, was to spread anarchy, was to set a bad example, the bad example of a developing country, giving it to the entire world.","But fortunately, the American people, with all its succeeding [SPEAKER]s since [SPEAKER] Kennedy, [SPEAKER] Johnson, and yourself, Mr. [SPEAKER], was never discouraged and continued to follow the same consistent line of confidence in my country and today we witness the crowning moment of this task of confidence.","The Congo, thanks to your Government and to the people of the United States, stands up and is an object, if not of envy, of pride for all its friends and particularly for the United States.","I should like to say that my official visit here has as its central purpose to say thank you with all our hearts for all you have done and for all you will be doing to assist us in our economic and financial recovery in the heart of Africa.","Since I have had the opportunity to speak here tonight, I must express publicly that we are setting an excellent example of cooperation between an industrialized country and a developing country. We are the living demonstration in concrete terms--the relations between the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are a demonstration of what has happened because you have helped us, and we are showing proof that this aid was not wasted, that we have used diligently the aid given to us for our recovery, for our march towards progress.","I am sure, Mr. [SPEAKER], that your voice will be heard by the Americans to whom you have said that the Congo is a good investment. You are right. This means for American investors, particularly of the private sector, that our recovery has been effective; that we have political stability, order, peace, and calm in the Congo; that the Congolese people is cured from its growing pains; that a people without a leader has become a people with discipline, work, and creative energy.","You have helped us launch the Zaire operation 1 which has succeeded. Our country, which was the sick child of Africa, now sets an example for all the countries of the developing world of what can happen with will, with determination, and this is a marvelous example we can show to the whole world.","Mr. [SPEAKER], you were speaking of what the American investors value most. What they want in a young country is the stability, and that we have; resources, and that we have also. But even more than our investment code which guarantees these investments, there is the fact that neither in our philosophical doctrine nor in our economic concept is there room for the concept of nationalization. We respect private ownership and we see great profits to be derived from this policy.","Confusion in the early stages of our history was taken advantage of to make people believe, and to make particularly American investors believe, that we would nationalize, but this is not true. There is no single private owner that can say that it was ever nationalized or that it will be. This will never be.","There is the unfortunate case of Union Miniere, 2 which is often cited. I do not want to go into past history, but Bossuet has said, \"The past can set an example for what we should do in the future.\"","But I believe that the philosophy of the investors should be to pursue a course of honesty and abide by the laws of the country to which they wish, not to take advantage of the lack of cadres or trained personnel and if by chance the powers begin to open their eyes and be vigilant, they should not then say, \"We are being nationalized\"--this is not good; not a good philosophy to follow.","I believe, Mr. [SPEAKER], that perhaps I went a bit astray tonight. I merely wanted to reply to you, to tell you how much my wife, my delegation, and myself are responsive to your warm welcome, the welcome that you and Mrs. Nixon, to whom I pay particular tribute, have given us the welcome of your government and your people. We are touched by it very, very deeply.","We can truly tell our people that here in America we have a people who have understood us through the good times and the bad times, that demonstration has been made that we are an example of the cooperation between an industrialized country and a developing country in the help we have received from you to our march on progress. This is something to make you proud and to this I should like to raise the glass of friendship between our two peoples.","1 A 1967 monetary reform program.","2 Union Miniere du Haul Katanga, a Belgian-owned copper mining company which was nationalized in 1966 by the Congolese Government.

Thank you very much, Governor Jay Rockefeller, who is destined, I believe, because of the deep appreciation of the West Virginia people for what he is and what he has been and what he will do, to be the next Governor of your great State. And I look forward to working with him during the next 4 years.","And I'm also grateful to Jennings Randolph, a man who sets a standard for public service that is an inspiration to us all. As Wendell Ford and Carl Perkins and Nick Joe Rahall and all of us who've served in Washington together know, most of the new ideas that come forward for us to address have already been understood and proposed by Jennings Randolph, because he has his heart close to the people of this Nation. And when there's a real need for better housing, better transportation, better use of coal, better life for the working families of this Nation, Jennings Randolph seems to have a special sensitivity to understand that need and to lead the rest of us in meeting those needs for all.","I'm grateful, too, to have a chance to come here to meet with people from Ohio, particularly Kentucky, because they are represented here by a great Governor and also by a great Senator. And Carl Perkins, a Congressman from across the river, is one of my greatest friends of all.","Let me say that I've spent the last few days thinking about the upcoming debate tomorrow night. As Wendell Ford pointed out, my opponent is not out campaigning among the people; he's trying to decide what role he's going to play in the debate tomorrow night. The problem that I've had in preparing myself for the debate is, which Ronald Reagan am I going to face tomorrow evening on television? Because as the election has progressed and as we get closer and closer to the voting time, he has flip-flopped on almost every conceivable issue depending upon what audience happens to be listening to him at the particular time.","He's been strongly against, even prayed against, aid for New York City, but lately he's been in New York, telling them how much he loves New York. He was against many things for which he now professes to support. Not too long ago, as a matter of fact this October, to the automobile workers in the Chrysler plant, he was telling them how proud he was that the Federal Government, with the help of the people on this stage, had helped Chrysler stay solvent. But that contrasts with the Ronald Reagan of last October, who said he didn't see anything wrong with Chrysler going bankrupt.","I don't know if I'll be debating the Ronald Reagan who now professes to be for safety and health of workers, or one who replied not long ago when somebody said that OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, ought to be abolished, who stood there and said, \"Amen.\" I don't know if I'll be debating a man of this election campaign who now professes to be for improving the social security system, or one who on at least four different occasions has suggested making social security voluntary, a proposal that would mean the end of a strong and viable social security system.","I don't know if I'm running against a man who opposed selling grain to the Soviet Union last year, or the one who declined this year to support the grain embargo after the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan. I don't know if I'm debating a Ronald Reagan who now professes to be for working families, but who's against labor law reform, who's against the Davis-Bacon Act, who said about the minimum wage that it's caused more misery and more unemployment than anything since the Great Depression, and who said just this year again that the primary cause of unemployment was the minimum wage.","I don't know if I'm debating against a man who now professes to be for working families who are temporarily unemployed, or one who said not too long ago that unemployment compensation was just a prepaid vacation for freeloaders. I don't know if I'm debating a man who lately professes to be almost in the image of Franklin Roosevelt, or one who a little earlier said that the foundation for the New Deal was fascism.","I may be having difficulty predicting what Governor Reagan will be saying in this debate, but we all know which Ronald Reagan would sit in the Oval Office if the Republicans win this election. It'll be the same Ronald Reagan who said just a few weeks ago that he hasn't changed his position in the last 20 years, the Ronald Reagan who worked to kill Medicare, who opposes national health insurance, who rejects a decade of progress in nuclear arms control, who wants to scrap the synthetic fuels program, which will take coal from this region and convert it into synthetic fuel, that's the key to breaking the OPEC stranglehold which they formerly had on us.","There's one thing in this election that is certain, though, and I want you to listen very carefully to this, because you've got a good voting record in this area. Republicans always campaign like Democrats. You've heard them. They quote Franklin D. Roosevelt; they quote Harry Truman; they quote John Kennedy; they quote Lyndon Johnson. But think about this question: Have you ever heard a Republican candidate for [SPEAKER] quoting a Republican [SPEAKER]?AUDIENCE. No!","[SPEAKER]. NO. Never, never. But when they get in the Ova Office, they're just like all the Republican [SPEAKER]s that have caused hardship and trial and tribulation and forgotten the working families of this country, but they try to mislead you the last few days before the election. That's one thing you can count on. Republicans will govern like Republicans. Don't you forget it on election day.","I want to say just a word about coal. I'm proud to have been able in my administration, working with your Democratic Governors, United States Senators, the Members of Congress, to do more for the coal industry than ever before in the history of this country. Listen to this: We will produce more coal in 1980 than has ever before been produced in the United States of America. We will exceed 800 million tons for the first time, and the trend is in the right direction. This is the first year in our history in which more than 50 percent of all our Nation's electricity has been produced from coal.","Our exports of coal to foreign countries will set an alltime record this year. And we could load millions more tons of coal on ships to be sold overseas if we just had the transportation system and the port loading facilities available for this new demand for coal that's been brought about by the policies of our administration.","In the near future, as you know, you will have an exciting, new, bright life ahead of you as we begin to produce synthetic liquids and gaseous fuels from your coal. We can triple—triple—United States coal production in the next 15 years if we keep Democrats in office to help you. That's where we need your help.","As you know, over the past several weeks, since the Congress has finally passed our new energy policy into law, we've begun to move on our new synthetic fuels program. We've signed historic agreements to help finance and to guarantee the construction of synthetic facilities, including the SRC-1 program in Kentucky and the SRC-2 plant in West Virginia. These major plants will be the forerunner of others in this Nation and will show why 75 percent of the $88 billion in windfall profits tax will go to produce synthetic fuels out of coal.","The American people have to understand, though, and this is an important thing for you to remember, that coal is both a clean fuel and also a safe fuel. If we are ever to achieve our goal for energy security, do not let anyone try to convince .you that the best way to produce and' use more American coal is to lower air quality standards or water quality standards. To do that will turn the American people and the world against coal.","What these men on the platform and I have done, working with Sam Church, [SPEAKER] of the United Mine Workers, is to try to make sure that all the projected increases that I've described to you, all of them, include maintaining the quality of our environment. We do not have to make people choose between jobs and prosperity on one hand and good health and a beautiful America on the other. We can burn coal, let it be the bright new vision of an independent policy in the future, and still keep our air clean and our water clean and our land productive. Do not let anyone mislead you about that, because the best way to turn people against coal is for them to think that we have to lower those standards for air and water quality.","Last week the Environmental Protection Agency extended a plan in Ohio which will allow greater use of coal. This plan sets limits on average emissions over a 30-day period, rather than a daily average. And this will continue on into 1982. This would allow much greater use of Ohio coal.","Also last week the EPA and Armco Steel Company reached agreement on an innovative approach to control air pollution of the Armco plant in Middletown, Ohio. Instead of controlling each individual source, it limits the total pollution emitted from an imaginary bubble over the entire plant. This allows the company to concentrate its cleanup efforts on sources that are the least costly to control. The result is more pollution control per dollar spent. This is the first practical application of this new principle. And now other steel companies throughout the Nation can do the same, reducing pollution control costs and thus raising capital or money to modernize their facilities and to put more people to work.","Just last Friday we announced a grant to finance a coke production plant in Canova, West Virginia. This would not only mean new jobs at the plant when it's finished, but 300 construction jobs and 1,500 miners will go to work now in West Virginia, in Virginia, and in Kentucky.","In order to meet export demand we are going to rebuild our railroads; we are going to improve our highways; we are going to improve our loading facilities at our major seaports. In international energy markets my goal is to replace OPEC oil with West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky coal.","And finally, let me say this: Coal is important for the security of our Nation. Many of you have spent your lives in the coal mines and in the communities surrounded by the mines. You've contributed a lot to the quality of life of other Americans. But it's important, too, to remember the well-being and the health and the safety of the miners and the miners' families, to protect the interests of the mineworkers. Working with [SPEAKER] Sam Church and your representatives, we have broadened black lung protection, we've guaranteed mineworkers' pensions, and I've requested extensions of trade adjustment assistance and unemployment benefits so that workers do not have to bear all the hardships as our Nation faces up to rapidly changing economic circumstances and prepares for a brighter economic future.","If American workers have the tools and the training, they can out-produce any workers on Earth. And we're going to give them the tools and training. With a new energy policy as a foundation, we're ready to move into the future and rebuild opportunities for jobs and a brighter and more prosperous life for Americans. At the end of the Second World War, America rebuilt the industry of Germany; America rebuilt the industrial complex of Japan. And now it's time for us to rebuild the industrial complex of the United States of America, and that's what we're going to do. You help me, I'll help you; we'll have a better future in the years ahead if Democrats are in office.","Thank you very much. I'm counting on you. Work this last week."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmartynlewisbbc1britishtelevision","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED], your Secretary of State talked yesterday of hard choices to be made on both sides. What are the main difficulties facing you and President Gorbachev as you sit down at the table next week at the summit?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, of course, there's a cloud of tension because of the Baltic States. I determined long ago that it was important that this summit meeting go forward and be successful, and yet I would be misleading you if I didn't say that the inability to get dialog going there between the Lithuanians and the Soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the United States.","Secondly, I'd like to think we can move the conventional force talks further along than they are now. I think in START  we're in reasonable shape, although it won't be ready for a treaty signing. On the chemical weapons side, I think there could well be good news for the free world and everybody in the world if they share my concern about reduction and eventual elimination of chemical weapons.","The European questions are not solved by a long shot. How, for example, does post-German unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What's the role for the United States in terms of stability?","So, all of these questions will be on the table, and I look forward to a very frank and full discussion. One thing I've found is Mr. Gorbachev will lay it on the table, and I think I owe it to him to let him know how we in the alliance feel and how we in the United States feel on our bilateral.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] taking those one at a time, Lithuania and the other Baltic States are struggling for the kind of freedom and independence that is right at the heart of the American ideal. Are you in any sense embarrassed that your pursuit of arms control success is in fact preventing you from saying what you would like to say about Lithuania?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I don't think it is preventing me, because what I say about Lithuania is, Lithuania is entitled to self-determination, to determine their own future. You see, our country has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. But where it could be a problem is some say because we feel that way and we do passionately and because talks are not going forward between the Lithuanians and the Soviets, therefore you ought to not have this meeting or set this summit meeting back. I don't feel that way. But I don't think it diminishes my personal commitment to freedom and democracy because we talk with the Soviets.","I would give you an example. We talked to the Soviets when Czechoslovakia wasn't free and Hungary wasn't free and Poland wasn't free. And so, we have a broad agenda there. And I'd like to feel that Mr. Gorbachev wants to go forward with what he says he's for, that is, eventual self-determination. But I don't feel a conflict there.","[INTERVIEWER]: But if Mr. Gorbachev continues to deny the Lithuanians and the other Baltic States self-determination, the right to go independent, will you not be forced to sacrifice the arms control treaty at some stage?","The [INTERVIEWED]: You know something, I've learned long ago not to answer questions quite that hypothetical, with respect, because we can conjure up a lot of scenarios, good and bad, and answer; but that I don't think is helpful on the eve of his visit here. But believe me, I will have an opportunity, as our Secretary of State did just within the last week, to reaffirm the United States commitment to freedom and to self-determination.","[INTERVIEWER]: You don't feel that you are sacrificing Lithuania on the order of arms control expediency?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I don't think so. And our agenda with the Soviet Union has far more to do with a lot of other subjects, too, than just arms control. But may I answer your question with a rhetorical question? When we talked to the Soviet Union when Czechoslovakia was what we call captive nation Hungary was and Poland was were we sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with the Soviet Union? Now, the world would clearly say of course you weren't, as long as we adhere to our principle of self-determination and freedom. So, that's the way I'd respond to my critics.","[INTERVIEWER]: And you're saying that arms control is the most important thing on your agenda, and you will go for that come what may?","[INTERVIEWED]: No, I'm not saying that's the most important. That's what you're saying or suggesting or asking me if I'm saying. We have a lot of regional problems that we discuss with the Soviet Union. We have the whole question of post-German unification Europe that is very, very important to the people in the U.K. and France and other NATO countries. We have the questions of German participation in NATO a vital question.","So, I'm not trying to set out for you priorities. Do I think arms control is important? Yes. Are we working with diligence to try to have a good arms control agenda? Absolutely. But I can't tell you that's the only thing that drives the meetings between me and Mr. Gorbachev. I want to talk to him frankly about things in Europe and in this hemisphere, and I don't want these two gigantic ships to pass in the night because of misunderstanding.","[INTERVIEWER]: Finally, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] do you think that Mr. Gorbachev is going to survive, that he's going to be the person you'll be negotiating with in a year's time, given the pressures that he has from the democrats and the radicals on one hand and from the military on the other?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I'm inclined to think the answer to your question is yes, but it is not my role as President of the United States to try to sort out who should lead the Soviet Union. In Mr. Gorbachev I see a man who has presided over dramatic changes in Eastern Europe that benefit freedom and benefit mankind, if you will, and so I give him credit for that.","I see somebody who's talking about perestroika and reform inside and openness, glasnost inside the Soviet Union, and I give credit for that.","But Soviet leadership is up to the Soviet people. And I don't think one's foreign policy can be determined or be predicated on one person can't be. But I think most Western leaders feel that in Mr. Gorbachev we have a man with whom we can talk frankly, with whom we agree on many principles; a man who has many problems, internal problems, facing him I'm talking about predominately economic problems a man who has tried to work with us constructively on many fields. So, that's why we're going to approach this summit with great openness, and yet there are outside events and you mentioned Lithuania outside concerns that put a little bit of a tension on this meeting.","But in terms of my sitting down, up at Camp David, and talking frankly with Mr. Gorbachev, he's the kind of person you can do that with. And I believe that that's useful to every country that the United States deal in this manner with Mr. Gorbachev. But that is not to say we have no problems.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] thank you very much for talking to the audience."," "]}

Not as often as I like, but during say, the Health Care Debate, when things are just, you know, going crazy over on Capitol Hill, a lot of times I'll just come out here and shoot or I'll play a game of HORSE it takes an edge off things.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Now these days when you're involved in Pick-Up games, do you feel that you're dealing with less physical contact since you became [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well it is true I usually have guys with guns around.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah, I noticed.","The [INTERVIEWED]: So, if somebody, you know, takes a real hard fall -- foul, they could get in trouble. Nobody ever lets me with because if you let me win, you'll never hear the end of it. I'll talk a little trash about you. I'll make you feel bad about yourself if we beat you real bad.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Now, I'm assuming that Bowling is not on the schedule?","The [INTERVIEWED]: You know, my bowling has greatly improved. So Marv, you're touching on a slightly sensitive point. I'm not going to walk off the set here but, we do have a bowling alley here at the White House and I've gotten a lot better.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Now do you find yourself, as we all have back in the day on the playground, doing play-by-play to yourself? You come out here, maybe count it down. For example the game is tied --","The [INTERVIEWED]: In the back of my mind, [INTERVIEWER1] is making the call.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So, it's Obama with the ball. Top of the key, three seconds left... Unleashes for three. Yes!","The [INTERVIEWED]: I have your voice in my head as I'm shooting the three.","[INTERVIEWER1]: That's sad.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Now I know you don't want to be accused of tampering for your Bulls but, any advice that you might have, for LeBron James as he approaches free agency?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I think that the most important thing for LeBron right now is actually to find a structure where he's got a coach that he respects and is working hard with teammates who care about him and if that's in Cleveland, then he should stay in Cleveland. If he doesn't feel like he can get it there, then someplace else. The one thing I remember about the Bulls was it wasn't until Michael had confidence in Phil Jackson, Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant; it wasn't until you got that framework around you that you could be a champion. Same thing happened with Kobe. First with Shaq then later with Gasol, you know, he's gotten that sense of a team around him and I think LeBron hasn't quite been able to get that yet; that's what he needs to find.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Could you, on behalf of the Bulls, throw in perhaps a night in the Lincoln Bedroom or ride on Air Force One?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, like I said, I don't want to mettle. I will say this, Rose, Noah --","[INTERVIEWER1]: It's a pretty good core.","[INTERVIEWED]: It's a pretty good core. You know, you could see LeBron fitting in pretty well.","[INTERVIEWER1]: If you were NBA Commissioner for a day, what changes would you make?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I'll be honest with you, I think the game is in a good place right now. The way they're calling the game right now returns basketball to where its supposed to be; more of a finesse game. The biggest change I'd probably propose right now is, the commissioner needs to figure out how to price tickets so that ordinary people can go to the games. I mean I think that ticket prices have gotten so high, and I understand that salaries are high, ticket prices are going to be high but, you know, you hate to think that the only person that can go to a game is somebody who's got a corporate account. And that's something that I'd love all professional sports, that's not just NBA, but all professional sports to be thinking about a little more.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Alright the Phoenix Suns, in the news recently wearing the Los Suns jerseys on Cinco de Mayo. And they took a stand opposing Arizona's immigration policy, how do you feel about sports franchises getting involved in political issues?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I think that just because somebody's a sports figure or you got a sports team doesn't mean that you're not part of the community and you're not part of our democracy. I think it's terrific that the Suns, who obviously feel very strong about their community, recognize that a big part of their community felt threatened by this new law. You know, when I was growing up, you had figures like Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell who routinely would talk about the world around them. You wouldn't always agree with them but, that sense that, you know, people are engaged in the big issues of the day, I think is a positive thing and I don't think that either players or franchises need to always steer away from controversy. I happen to personally think that the Arizona Law is a bad idea, I've said so publicly and I see no reason why these guys can't make the same statement.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Here in Washington, it's a great deal of excitement. Wizards, now in possession of the overall first round pick. John Wall of Kentucky would be, I would guess, the early line favorite. What's your, I know you watch a lot of college basketball, what's your scouting report?","[INTERVIEWED]: Wall is a terrific player. I mean, you know, he's got the NBA speed, NBA body, great jump shot, unselfish, really impressive. There's only upside for that kid. And I think it'd be great for him to come to Washington. I became very close to Abe Pollin, who was a great supporter, he and wife. He just passes away recently but there's an example of a guy who constantly gave back to his community. I mean, almost single-handedly, he invested in downtown Washington at a time when it was in really bad shape. You know, generated huge affection in this city and it was wonderful to see his widow there; getting that number one pick and I only wish the best for that franchise.","[INTERVIEWER1]: What is the Presidential pick for this season's NBA Champions?","The [INTERVIEWED]: Boston surprised me. They gelled in the playoffs in a way that they hadn't all through the season. Rondo's become one of the best point guards in the league in no time. I mean, when he gets a real jump shot, he's going to be unstoppable but I've got to go with the Lakers again. I think Gasol may be the best big man in the league right now. He's different from Dwight Howard but he's playing --","[INTERVIEWER1]: Great footwork.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- unbelievable footwork. Speed savvy, he's playing magnificently. Kobe is, you know, the fiercest competitor in the league and they've got, you know, what I continue to believe is the best coach in the NBA right now in Phil Jackson so there going to be formidable and I think it'll be a tough series. You know, Boston's a veteran club but the Lakers are looking pretty good.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED], we appreciate your taking the time and I really like your back yard.","[INTERVIEWED]: Listen, you are welcome, Marv, to call play-by-play in any pick up game that we have. I want you to let Kenny know and Charles know, that I appreciate them. And I am curious about Charles' golf game though. I want to see if that swing ever got fixed.","[INTERVIEWER1]: A lot of people are curious about that.","[INTERVIEWED]: Charles is a great guy, great friend but that's, it's a scary golf swing."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmarvinstoneandjosephfrommusnewsworldreport","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED], as we look ahead into 1984, we would ask that you address six of the most critical foreign policy issues that concern Americans.","First, in the year ahead, how do you propose to rebuild a working relationship with the Soviet Union and revive meaningful arms control negotiations?","The [INTERVIEWED]. We can do it, because those negotiations are as much value to the Soviet Union as they are to anyone else. Even more important.","I have to point out that, with all this talk about the supposed strain in relations, there is an inference that somehow it is our fault. But we didn't kill Russian citizens by shooting down a civilian airplane. We didn't attempt to conquer an adjacent country to ours. We didn't walk out on negotiations and refuse to give a date for when we would resume. If there is a strain, it has not been caused by us.","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you believe the extended absence of Andropov from the picture where under certain circumstances you might have been able to have a meaningful exchange with him is affecting this relationship with the Soviets?","The [INTERVIEWED]. I still think we can continue to deal with them and resolve problems between us. The biggest problem we all face is achieving genuine peace in the world. I don't think they want a confrontation any more than we do.","We'll be at that negotiating table when the Soviets decide to come back ready to negotiate in good faith. We have never broken off communications. We have at several levels continued to meet with the Soviets and we are ready. I know, on the other hand, that the absence of Andropov must have had some influence on their side on exactly what could be done.","I believe that the Soviet Union has more to gain than we, or anyone else, in taking a look at changing the situation and, in effect, them joining the family of nations the way the rest of us have who are concerned with peace.","[INTERVIEWER]: Issue number two deals with the Middle East. A main concern is Lebanon. Do you believe that in 1984 it is going to be possible to withdraw our marines? And will it be feasible to do that only if and when a stable government is able to unify Lebanon?","The [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it will be possible to withdraw the marines in 1984. And that applies as well to the whole multinational force. Let me remind you why we sent the marines to Lebanon as part of the multinational force.","Our whole idea all along has been to bring peace to the Middle East area generally and to act as a kind of go-between to bring these warring nations together. But Lebanon stood in the way. You will remember that in the summer of 1982 Beirut was being shelled in every direction, and in 1976 the authorities there had asked the Syrians to come in and help keep order, because the Government of Lebanon was virtually nonexistent and powerless to do anything about it.","The multinational force moved in and created conditions that led to the partial withdrawal of the Israelis. Now there has been a change in Syria's position. Even after a request from the Lebanese Government to withdraw, the Syrians have refused, and they are still there.","We believe that the purpose of the multinational force would be accomplished with the withdrawal of the other foreign powers and the establishment of a stable Lebanese Government, supported by a rebuilt Lebanese Army. We have done a fine job of training and equipping the Lebanese Army. It needs to be some bigger than it is. But it is a good and a well-trained force. And it has performed well.","The idea was that as the foreign forces left and as the Lebanese forces moved out toward their borders to reinstitute control and stop the internecine fight, the multinational force would maintain order for example, in areas like Beirut because the Lebanese military couldn't do both. This is still the goal.","[INTERVIEWER]: Is that still a realistic goal?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I think that, with all that's happening, we're overlooking the progress that's been made. At recent discussions in Geneva, all of those involved even those who are presently hostile agreed to recognize the Gemayel government as the legitimate Government of Lebanon.","Another sign of progress is the fact, as I mentioned, that the Lebanese Army has been brought up to a capability it did not have before.","But now further progress hinges particularly on Syria, which is the stopping block in its refusal to withdraw even though it had once agreed to leave and said that if Israel left, it would leave. I don't say that the multinational force has to stay until all those foreign forces are out. I think that even if they gave an assurance that they're going to go and start the process maybe we could then leave.","[INTERVIEWER]: Subject three: With the prospect of continuing widespread terrorist attacks, how can the United States retaliate, especially when such attacks are inspired or sponsored by governments?","The [INTERVIEWED]: One of the hardest things, of course, is to prove that the terrorist attacks are sponsored by a government. For example, these groups that are taking credit for the recent suicide attacks are believed to have an Iranian connection. There is a faction of Iranians that believe in a holy war. We do have the evidence that Khomeini has spoken a number of times about advocating a holy war in the Moslem world to promote his type of fundamentalism. So, it's hard not to believe that he must, in some way, instigate or at least egg on those that are doing these things.","[INTERVIEWER]: What can be done to counter the terrorist threat?","The [INTERVIEWED]: I believe that if terrorists are claiming triumphs when they do these terrible deeds, acknowledging what their goal is and that they have a connection with some country then I think it's up to the government of that country to try to curb and control such groups. If some of our own terrorist groups commit these outrages such as the group that just bombed a naval recruiting station in New York it's our responsibility to corral them, find out who and what they are, and bring them to justice. But the same is true for all the other countries.","But the one thing we can't do is what so many people, even here in our own country, are advocating in the face of the terrorist attacks against our forces in Lebanon. That is to bring home the marines from Lebanon. If terrorism can succeed in its goal, then the world is going to find itself under the control of the terrorists. You have to stand against that and not let it succeed.","[INTERVIEWER]: What do you do if a government is actually responsible, as you say, for instigating terrorism? Can you really ask that kind of a government to assume responsibility for controlling these terrorists?","The [INTERVIEWED]. In those cases, I think that the civilized world has to get together and see what action can be taken. This does not necessarily mean warlike action, but pressures that can be put on a government-pressures such as saying to that government, \"You start taking some steps to control this, or you'll be outlawed in the rest of the world.\"","[INTERVIEWER]: Another issue; you're going to China in the spring. What, in your view, is going to be necessary to develop closer relations with that country, particularly in the strategic field? And do U.S. ties with Taiwan inhibit the process of improving relations with China?","U.S.-China Relations","The [INTERVIEWED]: I don't think they do. I know that the People's Republic of China is uncomfortable with our position on Taiwan. But we have reiterated time and time again to them that the people of Taiwan are longtime friends and, in fact, once were allies of ours. We have recognized that there is one China and that its capital is Peking. But we believe that the differences between Peking and Taiwan should be settled by peaceful negotiations.","We can't cast aside one friend in order to make another. We have argued to representatives of the People's Republic that they themselves should take some comfort from that because it's assurance to them that we wouldn't throw them aside to make friends with someone else.","I think we've made great progress. I know that sometimes the Government of the People's Republic has to speak out about this issue, but our trade relations and cooperation in the area of high technology, all of these things represent milestones and successive steps in improving our relations.","Now, the head of their government is coming here, and I am going there in the spring. We're going to find other areas where we can improve and increase our relationship cultural exchanges, things of that kind. All of this, I think, is on a good track. We've made some gains.","[INTERVIEWER]: Fifth: What strategy does the administration intend to pursue in Central America? Is it to underwrite the Government of El Salvador indefinitely? And in Nicaragua, is it to settle for nothing less than the overthrow of the Sandinistas?","The [INTERVIEWED]: Our policy in Central America is regional. This is very much what the Contadora process is. We're supporting the efforts of the Contadora group Mexico, Venezuela, Panama, and Colombia—to assure that democratic elections are used to settle the internal political conflicts and that verified agreements assure peace among the countries.","Now, as for the El Salvador Government: There has been important progress in recent years achieving democratic ideals, practices, and policy. They're beset by Cuban- and Soviet-backed insurgents who don't want that kind of government. They want the old-fashioned idea that we've seen for the last few hundred years the idea that if you have a revolution, it is only to exchange one set of rules for another set of rulers. For once, we've got a government there that says: \"No. This is to be revolution to change that process.\"","At the same time that the Government in El Salvador is fighting against this potent enemy on the left, they're being harassed from behind by small violent right-wing groups who want to go back to the old concept of government over the people, not by the people. So, we shouldn't be blaming the present Government of El Salvador for not being able to deal effectively with these rightists when it is beset by this other force on the left.","I think that the thing that is dragging this out are the limitations placed on our aid by the Congress. It's almost as if they're saying, \"Well, we'll give you just enough to let them bleed to death slowly.\" What we really need and remember that threefourths of our aid is for economic and social reforms, and the other 25 cents out of each dollar is for military aid is the kind of aid that will let them accomplish the job and eliminate this left-wing guerrilla force that is doing the attacking.","At the same time, wherever we can, we should help them find out these behind-the-scenes moves by the violent right that we will not accept. And where the government needs help in dealing with this, we should help. That was one of the missions that Vice President Bush performed when he was in El Salvador recently. I think some progress has been made in that regard. But we shouldn't let the violent right keep us from doing what is necessary to end the war that's going on.","[INTERVIEWER]: And Nicaragua—is overthrow of the Sandinistas the U.S. policy?","The [INTERVIEWED]. No. We are not demanding the overthrow of that government. All they have to do is go back to the 1979 democratic commitments they made to the OAS as part of the political agreement leading to the end of the Somoza regime. Remember, the U.S. gave them immediate diplomatic recognition and significant financial aid until we found out that one faction of the revolutionaries was exiling or imprisoning their more democratic partners in the revolution, who discovered the Sandinistas intended to have a totalitarian form of government.","Now, the Sandinistas' promises of human rights, of democratic principles, of free elections, union rights, and so forth—all of those promises were made in writing to the Organization of American States when they persuaded the OAS, during the revolution, to persuade Somoza to resign, which he did. They have not kept that contract.","Some of the leaders of the contras were fighting alongside of them in the revolution and then were ousted, just as Castro ousted the same kind of people and imprisoned some of his best lieutenants because they wouldn't go along with him to a Communist, totalitarian form of government.","Nicaragua could solve its problem right now. If this Nicaraguan Government wants to go back to the promises of the revolution, we'll step in and help. And what is the sixth issue?","[INTERVIEWER]: It deals with the use of power. The other day you spoke of \"the end of the days of weakness\" with the rebuilding of American military power. How do you envision the use of military power in pursuit of this country's foreign policy?","[INTERVIEWER]: Mainly, what we're talking about is deterrence. I have always believed in fact, the Chinese had this idea thousands of years ago that your army is really doing its job if it never has to fight. I view it from that standpoint.","The [INTERVIEWED]. After years and years of unilateral disarming on our side, with this country canceling weapons systems and so forth for domestic political reasons, the Soviets didn't have to give anything up. I think it was all explained in my favorite cartoon. It was the cartoon that portrayed Brezhnev when he was still alive, and it had him talking to a Russian general. Brezhnev said, \"I liked the arms race better when we were the only ones in it.\"","Now, the Soviets have found out they are facing a belated U.S. modernization program which will assure the effectiveness of our deterrent. I think that is the only reason they came to the table to discuss arms reductions. They have come to realize that we'll do whatever is necessary to make it evident that hostile moves on their part would result in equal or greater punishment to them. That's the purpose of our military buildup, and it certainly worked in Geneva."," "]}

And my first question for you would be, as Commander in Chief, what are the areas you are most focused on and most proud of as U.S. forces and the Iraqi forces continue to work towards stability and security in Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED]: I'm most proud of the performance of our troops. We have asked a lot of our military and the military families. We've got men and women who have been to both theaters in the war on terror, multiple times. And that's a strain, and it's hard. And I understand it is. On the other hand, our troops know it's necessary.","I am focused on making sure that we do not allow the sacrifice that has gone over the last 5 years to go in vain; that we end up making the hard decisions now, and helping the Iraqis now to develop a peaceful and free society in the heart of the Middle East, which will enable the next generation's children to grow up in a peaceful world or the next generation to grow up in a peaceful world.","And so I'm pleased with the progress.

It's been hard on the military, but I'm proud of the fact that the military has been so steadfast and courageous.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Speaking of the military and their families, you meet with many family members, many spouses, on a regular basis.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]: of those that are lost and wounded in the conflicts difficult situation, I'm sure. Could you take a moment and just tell us what it's like meeting with them and what you say to them and what they say to you?","[INTERVIEWED]: Sure. First of all, obviously, each circumstance is a little different. And you're right, I've met with a lot. Let me first start with the wounded. Generally what happens is, is that, in a place like Walter Reed or Bethesda, you know, a soldier will look at their Commander in Chief and say, \"I can't wait to get back in the battle,\" which obviously you know, first of all, it's just so inspiring to me, but it also it's got to change the perspective of their family a little bit.","Secondly, with the wounded, I am obviously always conscious to make sure that these kids, these soldiers people in uniform get the best care. And I truly believe they are. And I love our doctors and nurses. It's unbelievable the care they get.","In terms of meeting with the families of the deceased as you can imagine, it's very emotional. First of all, meeting the [INTERVIEWED] alone can be an emotional experience, and when you put on top of that the Commander in Chief who made the decision of that got their child in a position where he or she got killed, so, you know, the meetings can be very tearful. I'm a crier, at times. I'm not afraid to hug a mom or hug a wife or hug a husband and cry.","I try to get them to talk about their loved one. I want to learn about each individual person who sacrificed what they were like, what their interests were and a lot of times the families love sharing their stories with the Commander in Chief. And to a person, nearly, I have been told that, \"Whatever you do, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], complete this job.\" Don't and basically what they're saying is, \"Don't let politics, don't let the Gallup poll, don't let a focus group cause you to make a decision that is not in the best interests of our country and our military.\" And I assure them that they don't have to worry about that about [INTERVIEWED].","I tell my friends who ask me this question a lot, what they say: \"What's it like? You're the guy who made the decision to put their loved one in harm's way. They didn't come home. What's it like to meet with them?\" And I say that oftentimes the comforter in chief is the person who gets comforted, because of the strength and courage and great love of country of these folks.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's move to Afghanistan. It's been 61⁄2 years ","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: since we forced the Taliban out of power over there. What do you see the current situation for our troops right now, and how much work do you think needs to be done to sustain the progress that we've made?","[INTERVIEWED]: Afghanistan obviously is different from Iraq. Afghanistas I mean, Iraq is a wealthier nation. Afghanistan is broke, and they had a long way to go and from the days of the Taliban, and, you know, they have made interesting progress. I'm going to get some of these statistics a little wrong, but the point I want to make is that infrastructures change. I mean, it's I think there was like less than 100 miles of roads, and today, there's over 1,000 miles of road. Young girls weren't going to school, basically, and now there's a lot of young girls going to school. Health care was very rudimentary, and today, a lot of people have got basic health care. In other words, the condition human condition is changing, which is important.","The Taliban has not been defeated. In other words, they keep coming back. And an enemy such as this gets defeated when two things happen: One, you know, we bring their people to justice, as well as a society develops which marginalizes themin other words, something that competes with their ideology. Everybody in Afghanistan knows what the Taliban's ideology is like. They had to live under them. And now that we're trying to help them realize there's another way and a more hopeful life. And until a you know, a civil society develops that provides hope for the Afghan people, it's going to be the Taliban will be a factor.","And so they're a factor now. Are they winning? No, they're not winning. Can they beat us militarily? Absolutely not. And so a lot of what and we're bolstering our troops there, by the way, just to make sure that they're not able to intimidate the people to the point where a civil society and a free society can't develop.","So we've got work to do there. The good news is we're not in there alone. There's a lot of NATO troops some of whom fight, some of whom don't fight, but all of whom make a contribution. And I'm going to NATO next week and the NATO meeting in Romania. And I'll, of course, be urging our allies to bolster their presence in Afghanistan because and I'll remind them that this was the country that had failed so miserably, that not only were people brutalized, but an enemy that hates America and hates free societies developed safe havens from which they launch brutal attack.","And now is the time to deal with them and not hope they change their mind or hope they become better citizens of the world, because they're not.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Africa","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]: the new Africa Command; you just were on a trip to five countries in Africa. Tell me, if you can, briefly, the significance of Africa Command, and strategically and how it will play in the global war on terror.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, first of all, there's some nervousness about the African command in Africa because nations don't want U.S. troops stationed on their border. And so I had to spend time saying, wait a minute, this isn't a typical command. What this is, is a command that will help Africans deal with African problems, such as Sudan. We want well-trained African troops going into places like Sudan, helping the poor folks there who are being brutalized by, you know, thugs, to be able to survive and thrive.","And first of all, this administration recognizes that Africa is important. That's why we name an African command. Secondly, that hopelessness is the only way radicals can recruit, and therefore, we have programs to, you know, deal with malaria and HIV/AIDS and hunger. But the other source of instability on the continent of Africa is civil unrest, is civil war, is, you know, inflamed passions that break out into violence. And it's in our interests that we help Africans deal with those problems. That's what Africa Command is meant to do.","And so it fits into the broader scope of things, the broader war on terror, and also it's a commitment that we care about the people on the continent of Africa."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattfreibbcworldnewsamerica","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to Africa","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] thanks for joining us. You're famous for saying that you don't believe in opinion polls.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you have any idea how you rate in the countries that you're going to be visiting in Africa?","[INTERVIEWED]: No, sir, I don't.","[INTERVIEWER]: Well, I've got news for you, and it's good news. You rate pretty well, sort of in the average eighties. Is that one of the reasons why you're going there? This is one part of the world where you're still very popular.","[INTERVIEWED]: I go where needed. And no, I'm going there because I've got a firm, heartfelt commitment to the continent of Africa and had ever since I became [INTERVIEWED]. It's in our interests, national interests, that we help people who are suffering from disease and hunger and hopelessness. The only way a radical can recruit is to find somebody that's hopeless. I mean, their vision is, like, really dark and dim.","Plus, I believe to whom much is given, much is required. And America has been given a lot, and it's required of us to help those who suffer. So mine is a mercy a mission of mercy and a mission of the cold realism of the world in which we live—based upon the realism in the world in which we live.","[INTERVIEWER]: Your administration has given $15 billion to treat AIDS in Africa, which is an unprecedented amount of money, and you want to double that amount yet again. This is a huge commitment, and yet the administration and you, personally, don't seem to be getting a lot of credit for it.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes. You know, this is kind of tied to your first question about polls. Polls are nothing more than just, like, a poof of air. What matters is results. And ultimately, people will be able to make an objective judgment of a [INTERVIEWED] and his administration and, in this case, a country's commitment. And so all I care, really, about is the results of the programs.","I hope by now people have learned that I'm not one of these guys that really gives a darn about elite opinion. What I really care about is, are we saving lives? And in this case, we are. As I mentioned in my speech that you kindly listened to, when I first went to sub-Sahara Africa, 50,000 people were receiving antiretrovirals; today, 1.3 million. And that's a lot in a very quick period of time. But there's still so much more suffering, and that's why I've called for a doubling of aid.","The good news is, it's not just America. As I mentioned in my speech, the G-8 nations also are supporting this very important initiative. And, you know, it's just in other words, this isn't a paternalistic effort, this is an effort of mercy.","[INTERVIEWER]: But it has made a huge difference, hasn't it? So why not take some credit for it?","[INTERVIEWED]: Because it's just not my nature. I really you just got to understand about me: I'm more interested in seeing results and sharing the credit with the American people. I mean, this is not a [INTERVIEWED] effort. I just happen to be the leader of a nation that's willing to fund this kind of money. And so I praised Congress in my speech; I praised the American people in my speech. After all, they're the ones who are funding the effort.","[INTERVIEWER]: You were very tough in your speech about Darfur, and yet again, you called what's happening there genocide.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: Is enough being done by your administration to stop that?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think we are, yes. You know, I had to make a seminal decision, and that is whether or not I would commit troops into U.S. troops into Darfur. And I was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in America that care deeply about the issue. And so once you make that decision, then you have to rely upon an international organization like the United Nations to provide the oomph, the necessary manpower.","And in my speech today, I did call it genocide again. I think we're the only nation that has done so. Secondly, I did remind people that we're sanctioning leaders, that we have targeted Sudanese companies and individuals, including a rebel leader who have yet to be constructive in the peace process. We're beginning to get a sense that these sanctions are affecting behavior. We're trying to ask others, by the way, to do the same thing, some of whom are reluctant, some who aren't. And then, finally, I pledged that we'll help move troops in. And as I also said you might remind your listeners that I'm frustrated by the pace.","[INTERVIEWER]: I'll get onto that in a minute, but, I mean, \"genocide\" is such a loaded it's such an important word. And you have committed troops, American troops, around the world in other cases, Iraq, most famously, Afghanistan. Why not in this case?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, that's a good question. I mean, we're committing equipment, training, help, movement. I think a lot of the folks were concerned about America into another Muslim country. Some of the relief groups here just didn't think the strategy would be as effective as it was. I mean, I actually, believe it or not, listen to people's opinions and chose to make this decision. It's a decision that I'm now living with, and it's a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world and get people to focus on the issue.","You know, you're right. I mean, we sent marines into Liberia, for example, to help stabilize the country there. And Liberia's on my itinerary, where I'll meet with the first woman elected President in Africa's history. But I just made the decision I made.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yesterday Steven Spielberg, the Hollywood director, pulled out of the Beijing Olympics over Darfur. He said the Chinese aren't doing enough to stop the killing in Darfur.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you applaud his move?","[INTERVIEWED]: That's up to him. I'm going to the Olympics. I view the Olympics as a sporting event. On the other hand, I have a little different platform than Steven Spielberg, so I get to talk to President Hu Jintao. And I do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur.","There's a lot of issues that I suspect people are going to opine about during the Olympics. I mean, you got the Dalai Lama crowd; you've got global warming folks; you've got Darfur. And I just I am not going to go and use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the Chinese people in a public way because I do it all the time with [INTERVIEWED]: I mean, so people are going to be able to choose pick and choose how they view the Olympics.","[INTERVIEWER]: The Chinese Government has been saying, in part in response to this, that America is trapped in cold war thinking.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I think that's just a brush-back pitch, as we say in baseball. It's a America is trapped in this notion that we care about human life; we respect human dignity and that's not a trap; that's a belief and that many of us in this country recognize that the human condition matters to our own national security. See, I happen to believe we're in an ideological struggle. And those who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives are evil people, but they have an ideology. And the only way you can recruit for that ideology is to find hopeless folks. I mean, who wants to join an ideology that say: women don't have rights; you can't express yourself freely; religious beliefs are the only religious belief you can hold is the one we tell you. And, oh, by the way, it's great; you can be a suicider. Hopeless people are the ones who get attracted by that point of view. And therefore, it's in the world's interest, from a national security perspective, to deal with hopelessness. And it happens to be in our moral interest. I repeat to you: I believe to whom much is given, much is required. It happens to be a religious notion, but it should be a universal notion as well. And I believe America's soul is enriched, our spirit is enhanced when we help people who suffer.","[INTERVIEWER]: I mentioned the genocide thing also because your predecessor, President Clinton, said that the one thing one of the key things that keeps him up at night is that he didn't do enough over Rwanda to stop the killing there. Is it possible that Darfur might become your Rwanda?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't think so. I hope I certainly hope not. I mean, Rwanda was, I think, 900,000 people in a very quick period of time of just wholesale slaughter. And I appreciate President Clinton's compassion and concern. And I'm comfortable with making a decision that I think is the best decision and comfortable with the notion that once that decision is made, we're keeping the world's focus as best as we can on that, amongst other issues.","[INTERVIEWER]: You also had some very strong language today about Zimbabwe.  ","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes, I did.","[INTERVIEWER]:  which is an issue that certain Britain and the United States care deeply about. Again, this has been going on for years. What can be done to stop the crisis in Zimbabwe?","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes, I first is call the is to speak to the conscience of the world and remind people the facts. I mean, Zimbabwe was the breadbasket of southern Africa, and today, it's in line for food aid. Zimbabwe was a is now a place where people are repressed because of their beliefs. And you're right; there is not a lot of outcry. And it's a frustrating look, not everything is perfect in this world, and it just requires constant focus.","And one way to do it is for the American President to speak out or the British Prime Minister to speak out. And, as you know, I mentioned South Africa. I have great respect for the people of South Africa. I just happen to believe their Government can do more to enhance a free society in their region. Yes, it's just there's a lot of frustrations in this world, and there's a lot of hope in this world as well.","[INTERVIEWER]: You're nearing the end of your second term and, I guess, one can call is legacy time. Whatever you do and say about Africa, there's only one country, really, that the wider world will associate with you, and that equation is, [INTERVIEWED] equals Iraq.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: Are you happy about that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I mean, that's what the current elite would like everybody to think about, and that's fine. I think history will have a when history marches on, there will be a little more objective look about the totality of this administration.","Of course, our change in the way we did aid in Africa is substantial and different, and lives will have been saved. Being the first [INTERVIEWED] to propose a two-state solution on Israel and Palestine I mean, there's a lot of other issues. And I'm happy with Iraq. The right the decision to move Sad-dam Hussein was right, and this democracy is now taking root. And I'm confident that if America does not become isolationist and allow the terrorists to take back over, Iraq will succeed.","[INTERVIEWER]: Are you—do you regret, rather, I should say, that you didn't listen to your—some of your commanders earlier to send more troops to Iraq to achieve the kind of results that we're seeing now to some extent?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, my commanders didn't tell me that early. My commanders said, we got the right level of troops. You know, wars it's easy to second the tactical decisions of war, and I fully understand and expect that to happen. All I can do is base decisions on the considered judgment of the experts. And I did. And I take full responsibility for every military decision that's been made in Iraq. But I'm pleased with what's happening now. And the world is beginning to recognize that the decision to send more troops was a pretty tough decision at the time is providing enough security for the politics to take place. And this morning you're the first reporter I've been able to describe these conversations to, but I did speak to the Prime Minister, the Speaker, and two Deputy Speakers to congratulate them on a series of substantial legislative achievements that are beginning to say to the world and, more importantly, the Iraqi people, reconciliation is happening, and the legislative body is beginning to function, which is good news.","[INTERVIEWER]: The Senate yesterday passed a bill outlawing waterboarding. You, I believe, have said that you will veto that bill. Does that not send the wrong signal to the rest of the world?","[INTERVIEWED]: No, look, that's not the reason I'm vetoing the bill. The reason I'm vetoing the bill first of all, we have said that whatever we do is for legal will be legal. Secondly, they are imposing a set of standards on our intelligence communities, in terms of interrogating prisoners, that our people will think will be ineffective.","And to the critics, I ask them this: When we, within the law, interrogate and get information that protects ourselves and possibly others and other nations to prevent attacks which attack would they had hoped that we wouldn't have prevented? And so the United States will act within the law, and we'll make sure our professionals have the tools necessary to do their job within the law.","Now, I recognize some say that these terrorists really aren't that big a threat to the United States anymore. I fully disagree. And I think the President must give these professionals, within the law, the necessary tools to protect us. So we're having a debate not only on how you interrogate people; we're having a debate in America on whether or not we ought to be listening to terrorists making phone calls in the United States. And the answer is, darn right we ought to be.","[INTERVIEWER]: But given Guantanamo Bay, given also Abu Ghraib, given renditions, does this not send the wrong signal to the world?","[INTERVIEWED]: It should send the signal that America is going to respect law but is going to take actions necessary to protect ourselves and find information that may protect others. Unless, of course, people say: \"Well, there's no threat. They're just making up the threat. These people aren't problematic.\" But I don't see how you can say that in Great Britain, after people came and blew up bombs in subways. I suspect the families of those victims understand the nature of killers.","And so what people got to understand is, we'll make decisions based upon law. We're a nation of law. Take Guantanamo, look, I'd like it to be empty. On the other hand, there's some people there that need to be tried. And there will be a trial, and they'll have their day in court, unlike what they did to other people.","No, there's great concern about and I can understand this that these people be given rights, but they're not willing to grant the same rights to others. They'll murder, but you got to understand, they're getting rights. And I'm comfortable with the decisions we've made, and I'm comfortable with recognizing this is still a dangerous world.","[INTERVIEWER]: Can you honestly say, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] that today, America still occupies the moral high ground?","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely. Absolutely. We believe in human rights and human dignity. We believe in the human condition. We believe in freedom. And we're willing to take the lead; we're willing to ask nations to do hard things; we're willing to accept responsibilities. And yes, no question in my mind, this is a nation that's a force for good. And history will judge the decisions made during this period of time as necessary decisions. And I firmly believe that we are laying the foundation for peace.","People have written off the Middle East it's impossible to have change the conditions there; let's just ignore it, or let's promote stability, which was part of the foreign policy of the past. I chose a different course. Stability didn't work. Stability created the conditions that were ripe for these terrorists to emerge and recruit. I happen to believe free societies provide hope. And I would hope that people in Europe, for example, understand that freedom has led to peace and ought to be supporting the freedom movements and not shy away from the responsibility of the comfortable to help those who long for freedom.","And it's hard work. It's really hard work, and it doesn't happen instantly. You know, we live in a world like, in all due respect to 24-hour news, we live in a world where everything is, like, instant. But the work we're doing is it takes patience, but most importantly, it takes faith in the universality of freedom that exists in every heart.","And so yes, I'm not only happy to defend decisions, I'm confident that they will lead to a better tomorrow.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] I gather we've run out of time. Thanks for doing this.","[INTERVIEWED]: Thank you, sir. You bet.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you."]}

Once again uh, we're the only guys wearing coats, you're wearing a tie.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Exactly, exactly. Everybody else is drinking beer and eating chips. It's a good matchup, today. I know your Bears aren't here. Do you like the matchup?","[INTERVIEWED]: It is gonna be a great game. You know, what the Giants have done, coming back from a tough situation in the middle of the season has been pretty remarkable and Belicheck and Brady they're always tough. So it's gonna be a close game.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Who do you like?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I can't call it. I think this is gonna be one of those where it comes down to a turnover or some ball on somebody's helmet. . .","[INTERVIEWER1]: Come on, come on. Three years ago I sat right here, it was Pittsburgh vs Arizona, you went right out on a limb and said the Steelers would win. Why this year is it different?","[INTERVIEWED]: I, I think this is gonna be a tough game. Both teams have have their weaknesses. They're not as strong as they were uh I think,a couple of years ago. When you look at the Patriots, their defense is a little shaky. Uh, the Giants have just come back. So I can't, I can't tell you who's gonna win this one.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Little history for you. OK, 2004 when the Patriots were in it, they won it. George Bush went on to become president of the United States. 2008, the Patriots were in it, they lost it to the Giants, a guy named [INTERVIEWED] went on to become [INTERVIEWED], so who do you do you want to win this year?","[INTERVIEWED]: You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get me. I'm gonna look for a great game.","[INTERVIEWER1]: What about the ladies in the [INTERVIEWED] household, do they feel about Tom Brady the same way ladies all around the country feel about this guy?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think they know he's a good lookin guy, there's no doubt about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Is there perhaps a poster of Tom Brady somewhere in the East Wing?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know they haven't. . the girls 13, 10; they're not quite of the age yet where they start to uh putting up the pictures of guys yet. Uh,","[INTERVIEWER1]: Justin Bieber maybe.","[INTERVIEWED]: When that happens, I will uh, I, I may, you know, call some executive privileges and say that's not appropriate.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's change subjects a little bit because there are a lot of other headlines I'd like to ask you about, one in particular seems to be building tension between Israel and Iran. It seems now the Israeli's are signaling that they may act and conduct a strike inside Iran at their nuclear sites, sooner than later. Do they have your full support for that raid?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't think that Israel has made a decision on what they need to do. I think they, like us, believe that Iran has to stand down on its nuclear weapons program. And we have mobilized the international community in a way that is unprecedented. And they're feeling the pinch. They're feeling the pressure, but they have not taken the step that they need to, diplomatically, which is to say, \"We will pursue peaceful nuclear power. We will not pursue a nuclear weapon.\" Until they do, I think Israel rightly is going to be uh very concerned, and we are as well.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Has Israel promised you that they would give you advanced warning to any such attack should they give you that warning?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know I won't go into the details of our conversations. I will say that we have closer military and intelligence consultation between our two countries than we ever have. And my number one priority continues to be the security of the United States but also the security of Israel. And we are gonna make sure that we work in lock step, as we proceed to try to solve this, hopefully diplomatically.","[INTERVIEWER1]: When you talk about the security of the United States, Iran has had a long time to contemplate how they might respond to such an attack. Do you fear that they will wage attacks within the United States on American soil?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, we don't see any evidence that they have those intentions or capabilities right now. And again, our goal is to resolve this issue diplomatically, that would be preferable. But we're not going to take any options off the table, though. Obviously any kind of uh additional uh military activity inside the Gulf is disruptive and has a big effect on us. It could have a bit effect on oil prices. We've still got troops in Afghanistan, which borders Iran. And so our preferred solution here is diplomatic. We're going to keep on pushing on that front, but we're not gonna take any options off the table. And I've been very clear, that we're gonna do everything we can to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and creating an arms race, a nuclear arm race, in a volatile region.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Three years ago we sat for this interview on Superbowl Sunday. You had been [INTERVIEWED] for just 10 days, and we talked about the state of the economy which was in dire straits, and you said this to me, quote \"if I don't have this done in three years, then it's going to be a one-term proposition. You got good news on Friday in terms of jobs. The unemployment rate went down to 8.3%. But I think if you go out on the street and you ask average Americans is the recovery done, overwhelmingly they will tell you it is not. So do you deserve a second term?","[INTERVIEWED]: I deserve a second term, but we're not done. Look, when you and I sat down, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month. In fact we had found out just a few days before we sat down that we'd lost, that month, 750,000 jobs. Now we're creating 250,000. We've created 3.7 million jobs over the last 23 months. We've created the most jobs since 2005, the most manufacturing jobs since 1990, but we're not finished. And we've got to not only boost up American manufacturing, so that not just the auto industry but all American manufacturing is building again and selling overseas. We've got to make sure that we're pushing American energy. And that includes not just oil and gas but clean energy. We've got to make sure that the skills of American workers are the best in the world, and we're making progress on that front. And we've got to return to old-fashioned American values--everybody getting a fair shot, everybody doing their fair share, everybody playin by the same rules. And that means, for example, regulations to make sure that Wall Street is followin the same rules that Main Street is doin. But we've made progress, and the key right now is just to make sure we don't start turning in a new direction that could throw that progress off.","[INTERVIEWER1]: We've got a lot more to talk about. You've been kind enough to say that we can stick around here and we'll tape something that people will see tomorrow morning on the Today Show. [INTERVIEWED], enjoy the game. Thanks very much.","[INTERVIEWED]: I hope everybody has a great Super Bowl. It's gonna be a great game.","[INTERVIEWER1]: All right. We're going to be back with the countdown to SuperBowl 46 from Indianapolis right after this.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I asked [INTERVIEWED] if he was satisfied with Iran and the Intelligence on their nuclear ambitions.","[INTERVIEWED]: I think we have a very good estimate of when they could potentially achieve breakout capacity, what stage they're at in terms of processing uranium. But do we know all the dynamics inside of Iran? Absolutely not. And I think that one of the difficulties is is that Iran is a lot more divided now than it was. Knowing who is making decisions at any given time inside Iran is tough, but we do have a pretty good bead on what's happening with the nuclear program.","[INTERVIEWER1]: One of the things we do know, I would imagine, is that they are conducting a lot of this research and development far underground. And I understand the United States is in the process of developing the next generation of bunkerbusting bombs that can go far beneath the surface and take a site like that out. Will those bombs be ready in time? Would you use them, unilaterally, against those sites.","[INTERVIEWED]: Matt, I'm not going to discuss specific military programs or go into details in terms of what our planning is. I will say this, that uh, we have done extensive planning over the last several years about all our various options uh in the Gulf, and, uh, we are prepared to exercise these options should they, should the need arise. But, my goal is to try to resolve this diplomatically mainly because the only way over the long term we can assure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon is by getting them to understand it is not in their interest.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's talk about domestic politics. Mitt Romney is a guy who's running for your job. He may eventually become the nominee. He's a guy who's been incredibly successful in his life and career. He's made a lot of money. It's not a crime. It's part of the American dream.","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Do you think, though, that Mitt Romney can identify with the middle class and the underclass in this country?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, I'm not going to comment on any particular candidate until they decide who it is. . .the Republicans decide who their nominee's gonna be. I think most people are thinking the election's nine months away — the last thing we need is to start it right now when the other side hasn't determined its nominee. But I do think the vast majority of the American people understand, (a) we want everybody to be successful, and nobody begrudges people who've been successful because they're making things, creating new products, new services. That's the American way. But, what people also wanna see is that everybody is doin their fair share; we're all pulling together. That we're creating ladders of opportunity for all Americans. Whoever the Republican nominee is, I fundamentally disagree with a formula that would go back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place.","[INTERVIEWER1]: This idea, this idea of being able to reach out and connect to the middle class and having the middle class reach out to a political candidate.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: On Friday you held a fundraiser.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: You raised $900,000 in a couple of hours, I think. Twenty-five wealth individuals paid $36,000 apiece to spend a couple of hours with you.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: How do you think the guy sitting drinking a beer and eating chips watching the game today can identify with something like that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Right. Well I think, Matt, if you uh if you noticed uh about a month and a half ago I also had lunch with five folks who had given 25 bucks each who were part of this huge base of supporters we have all across this country. And it's precisely because we've been able to create a grassroots movement that I was successful in 2008 and I, uh, I think we'll be successful this time. Now if you ask me would I love to take some of the big money out of politics, I would. Unfortunately, right now, partly because of Supreme Court rulings and a bunch of decisions out there, it is very hard to be able to get your message out without some resources.","[INTERVIEWER1]: : Maybe the better question is how will you spend the money. And by all accounts you've raised a lot of money for this campaign, some people say up to a billion dollars. We've just seen in Florida on the Republican side a lot of money spent, about 100 percent of it spent on extremely negative personal ads. If you raise a billion dollars to keep this job, can we expect the same kind of negativity coming from that money?","[INTERVIEWED]: What I can tell you is that in 2008, part of the reason that we were successful is that we ran an affirmative campaign about my vision for where Am. . the United States should go. And I think what American s want to hear more than anything else is how are you gonna help me right now? If they're hearing a persuasive argument, about how we are gonna recreate a solid path for middle-class success in this country, then I think I'll win regardless of the negative ads coming out.","[INTERVIEWER1]: : And to that end, now this may sound like a little bit Pollyanna, [INTERVIEWED],","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: But when the Republican nominee is chosen would you agree to meeting with that person, whether it's Governor Romney or Speaker Gingrich, or whoever, and getting together with that person and talking about how the two of you plan to conduct yourselves over the course of this campaign. I think the American people would like that. Would you agree to that?","[INTERVIEWED]: You, you know, I think that uh you'll be able to see how we conduct ourselves in the campaign. I think it will be consistent with how I conducted myself in 2008 and hopefully how I've conducted myself as [INTERVIEWED] of the United States. I, uh, one of the worries we have obviously in the next campaign, is that there are so many of these so-called super-pacs, these independent expenditures that are going to be out there, uh, there's going to be just a lot of money floating around. And I guarantee you a bunch of that's going to be negative. But it's not gonna be enough just to say the other guy's a bum. You've got to explain to the American people what your plan is to make sure that there are good jobs at good wages and that this economy is growing over the long term. Whoever wins that argument I think is going to be the next [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWER1]: Which leads me well into this next question because I have talked to so many people over the last couple years, [INTERVIEWED] , who were huge supporters of yours back in 2008. And today they are not sure. I hear more and more that they're disappointed in you. That you aren't the transformational political figure that they hoped you would be. How does that make you feel when you hear that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Oh I, you know I think this is the nature of being . What's frustrated people is is that I have not been able to force Congress to implement every aspect of what I uh said in 2008. Well, it turns out uh that our Founders designed a system that makes it more difficult to bring about change than I would like sometimes. But what we have been able to do is move in the right direction. And what I'm going to just keep on doing is plodding away, very persistent. And, you know what? Uh, one of the things about being [INTERVIEWED] is you get better as time goes on.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Why though should a voter look and say, look he wasn't able to fix Washington, which is a big job for any one man. Perhaps there's more gridlock and more divisiveness in Washington now than there ever has been in the past. Why will he be able to do it in the next four years, and if he can't do it, isn't nothing going to get done?","[INTERVIEWED]: Even with a bunch of uh obstruction over uh on, uh, Capitol Hill, we've been able to save an auto industry. We've been able to take 750,000 jobs being lost a month and move it so that it's 250,000 jobs being created this month. We've been able to make sure that we ended uh the War in Iraq on schedule. We've been able to make sure that we ended policies like \"don't ask, don't tell.\" So we've been able to get a lot done. Not as fast as we want. Sometimes it's messy; the process is frustrating. I do think that this is going to be a critical election because uh, having yanked ourselves out of the risk of a great depression; having stabilized the economy; we now have a broader question which is how do we take it to the next level. And I think whoever comes in, both in Congress and in this White House, is going to have to uh take a strong message from the American people about which direction to go. And I think that will allow us to make more progress over the next couple of years.","[INTERVIEWED]: I said at the time with respect to Libya that we would be making these decisions uh on a case-by-case basis based on how unified the international community was, what our capacities were. Uh, but we have been relentless in sending a message that is time for Assad to go, that the kind of violence that we've seen exercised against his own people over this weekend and over the past several months, is inexcusable. But uh not every situation is going to allow for the kind of military solution that we saw . . .","[INTERVIEWER1]: But would you consider military action with our allies without UN approval, especially considering that China and Russia vetoed this latest resolution at the UN?","[INTERVIEWED]: It is important for us to try to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention and I think that's possible. My sense is you are seeing more and more people inside of Syria recognizing that they need to turn a chapter and the Assad regime is feeling the noose tightening around them. We're gonna just continue to put more and more pressure until hopefully we see a transition. This is not going to be a matter of if; it's going to be a matter of when.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Here we sit on Super Bowl Sunday. There's the cover of the New Yorker, the most recent New Yorker, and it has a picture of you watching the big game on TV. And there you are sitting there and up on screen it's not the Patriots and the Giants. It's Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, same team, and they are pummeling each other. And look at the smile on your face there. Is art imitating life here?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, uh, look, I've been through these primaries, they're tough. You know, I think...","[INTERVIEWER1]: But does this help you?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I think ultimately this will be forgotten by the time they make a decision on who their nominee is. And the American people are going to make a decision on my platform and where I want to take the country and where the Republican does. A lot of this stuff is good for selling newspapers and boosting ratings on TV, but I think in the end what they're going to be asking a question about is not the horse race. They're going to be asking, \"How is this going to help me in my life?\"","[INTERVIEWER1]: And finally on a personal note, [INTERVIEWED] wife gave an interview recently reacting to something that was written about her in a recent book, where she said that, you know, the image that has been out there since you decided to run for [INTERVIEWED] was she was some kind of angry black woman. And she said, \"That's not me. And the way to fight it is just go out there and be me and hopefully people will judge me based on me.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right","[INTERVIEWER1]: Taking the fact that you're [INTERVIEWED] out of it, as a husband, how does it make you feel when she's forced to address something that's clearly a characterization that upsets her?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, uh, as a husband, one of the things – and a father, one of the things that is toughest for me is that my family gets brought into the political realm, which isn't always very pleasant. And, you know, that weighs on me. Having said that, Michelle has been as good a first lady as I think anybody can imagine. And, when I watch her making a difference all across the country in terms of changing how kids are getting exercise and eating, and the passion she brings to the military families, uh I could not be prouder of her. I, I think she had some reservations about taking on this whole process going on this journey at the beginning of it and she's admitted that. She's talked about it. She's turned out to be really good, so-","[INTERVIEWER1]: Is she ready for four more years?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I think she is. Because she thinks, uh, that the work is really important. And I think even those folks who wish that I was doing more of this or more of that or questioning me on these policies or those policies, when you ask them about Michelle Obama, they give her a thumbs-up, and rightfully so.","[INTERVIEWER1]: That is  [INTERVIEWED]."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday","text":["About Search","INTERVIEWER1: We begin on a Tuesday morning with the disaster in the Gulf, now in its 50th day, and our exclusive interview with [INTERVIEWED]. We sat down on Monday before his commencement speech at a high school in Kalamazoo, Michigan. And I began by asking [INTERVIEWED] if the oil spill in the Gulf has made this the toughest point in his [INTERVIEWED] to date.","[INTERVIEWED]: This is tough, no doubt about it, because, you know, when you watch television or you go down to the Gulf and you see birds covered in oil and you talk to fishermen who are on the verge of tears   big, tough guys, but, you know, their livelihoods are being smothered by this oil that's coming into the estuaries and marshes it gets you frustrated.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Do you feel at this stage, 50 days or so into this, that your administration has been damaged by this oil spill?","[INTERVIEWED]: No. First of all, I'm not concerned about my politics right now. What I'm concerned about is what's happening down in the Gulf. And I guarantee you, the folks in the Gulf have been damaged by this oil spill. And livelihoods are at stake.","This is the largest federal response to an environmental disaster in history. From day one, we understood that this was going to be a major disaster. We have put unprecedented resources to deal with it.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Then why do you think there's so much frustration aimed not only at BP right now but at your administration? There are people who are starting to wonder out loud if the oil spill in the Gulf could be could do to you what Katrina did to President Bush or even what the Iran hostage situation did to Carter.","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I have to tell you, some of this is just the nature of the 24-hour news cycle. You've got a camera showing oil spilling out in the Gulf, and people are understandably frustrated and they're upset, and they have every right to be.","But here's what I can say, that we have responded with unprecedented resources. And when you look at what most of the critics say, Matt, and you ask them, \"Well, specifically what is it that the administration could or should have done differently that would have an impact on whether or not oil was hitting the shore?\" you're met with silence.","And the fact of the matter is there has not been an idea that is mentioned out there by any of the critics that we haven't evaluated. And if it was going to work, we would have done it. But it happened under my watch that you still had these oil rigs out there that we thought could deal with this kind of situation and they haven't been able to deal with it.","[INTERVIEWER1]: A day or so after that oil rig sank ","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I spoke to Rear Admiral Mary Landry of the Coast Guard ","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: who was speaking on behalf of the administration. And I asked her ","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I said, \"We're seeing an oil slick in the water. Where's that coming from?\" And she said, \"There is no evidence that that's coming from this wellhead. That's residual oil coming from the rig itself.\"","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: A day later, she echoed those same comments.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Was the administration misled, in your opinion? Were you relying too much on information from BP? And from the start, did BP try to downplay the situation?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, here's what I think happened. Initially the thinking was that, in fact, the rig had sunk but the blowout preventers had shut down the well, because that's what they were supposed to do. So the anticipation was maybe a thousand barrels might be leaking a day, but this is not going to be a monumental spill.","As soon as people understood that the blowout preventers weren't working, that the valves that were supposed to shut down in the event of a blowout like this had not functioned properly, then I think people understood right then that this was going to be a significant emergency.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Have you spoken directly to Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP?","[INTERVIEWED]: I have not spoken to him directly, and here's the reason, because my experience is when you talk to a guy like a BP CEO, he's going to say all the right things to me. I'm not interested in words. I'm interested in actions.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I ","[INTERVIEWED]: And we are communicating to him every single day exactly what we expect of him and what we expect of that administration.","[INTERVIEWER1]: In all due respect, that feels strange to me; that here we've got the CEO of a company that's responsible for the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, and I think  I'm just curious why you didn't pick up you wouldn't pick up the phone and in some ways just give him a piece of your mind.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, the look, this has sort of been this has been the main critique of the administration is giving a piece of my mind to these guys. Look, I would love to vent. I would love to just shout and holler, because I'm thinking about this day in and day out. But my main job is to solve the problem.","[INTERVIEWER1]: To solve the problem, you have to have a reliable partner. Let me read you some of the things that Mr. Hayward has said over the course of this disaster. He said, \"The Gulf of Mexico is a big ocean. The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we're putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume. The environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very, very modest.\" And then he said, \"There's no one who wants this to end more than I do. I'd like my life back.\"","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah. Well, I think  ","[INTERVIEWER1]: The family members of those 11 people who died on the rig and the people whose lives are going to be changed for years want their lives back too. He doesn't work for you. But if he did, would you want him out?","[INTERVIEWED]: He wouldn't be working for me after any of those statements. First of all, we're going to have to find out why this thing went in the first place. And the fact of the matter is that there's going to be a thorough review. And I don't want to prejudge it, but the initial reports indicate that there may be situations in which not only human error was involved, but you also saw some corner cutting in terms of safety, and that BP is a multibillion-dollar corporation. It's talking about paying $10.5 billion in dividends just for this quarter.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: We are going to have to make sure that not only do they shut down the cap, we are not only going to have to make sure that any deepwater drilling process that's out there is, in fact, fail-safe and oil companies know what they're doing, but we also have to make sure that every single person who's been affected by this is properly compensated and made whole. When I went down there last Friday ","[INTERVIEWER1]: Can BP do that? Can they do all that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely. They can afford it. If I start seeing BP nickel and diming folks down there, then they are going to have to answer to us.","[INTERVIEWER1]: We've heard time and time again throughout this crisis, as BP has tried and failed with all their fixes, that this technology is untested at this depth.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And it just raises a question. If this is where we're drilling for oil, at 4,000 and 5,000 feet under the surface of the ocean, where's the oversight in that? Why are they allowed to drill there if the worst-case-scenario methods to prevent disaster are untested at that depth? It doesn't help to test them at 100 feet.","[INTERVIEWED]: When it comes to how we were operating in overseeing and taking the word of the oil industry generally, not just BP in terms of the fail-safe nature of what they could do, I think we have to completely review that. And that's why I've assigned this bipartisan commission. I want them to report back to me, because you obviously cannot take the word of oil companies when they say they've got a bunch of redundancy and backup plans, when something like this happens and it turns out they have no idea what they're doing.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So even as the oil is spewing into the Gulf, would you consider halting all drilling below a certain depth right now?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, keep in mind what's happening. First of all, there is we've already instituted a moratorium ","[INTERVIEWER1]: On new drilling.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- on new drilling. The production wells that are already pumping oil, those don't seem to be the problem. The problem has to do with actually drilling and starting a new well. So we've put a moratorium on new wells. Shallow wells aren't a problem because the risers essentially come up above the water. So if something like this happened in a shallow-water well, then folks would just get up on the platform and they would start fixing it and it would be shut down fairly quickly.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- that we can actually handle a crisis like this.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Have you allowed yourself to even imagine what the Gulf region will look like if oil continues to spew until August, what it will smell like, what the economic situation will be like down there?","[INTERVIEWED]: I have. And here's what I'll say. This is going to be a mess. It already is. But I've been down there, and the people are resilient, and these ecosystems are more resilient than I think we anticipate right now, if we act swiftly, if we act seriously.","There are going to be marshes, for example, where the oil goes in and the sea life that's there is decimated for a season, maybe two. But potentially we can preserve those estuaries and those marshes so that three years from now things have come back; things have bounced back.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Critics are now talking about your style, which is the first time I've heard that in a long time. And they're saying here's a guy who likes to be known as cool and calm and collected, and this isn't the time for cool, calm and collected --","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: -- that this is not the time to meet with experts and advisers. This is a time to spend more time in the Gulf and -- I never thought I'd say this to a [INTERVIEWED] but kick some butt.","[INTERVIEWED]: [Chuckles.]","[INTERVIEWER1]: And I don't mean it to be funny.","[INTERVIEWED]: No. And I understand. And here's what I'm going to push back hard on this, because I think that this is just an idea that got in folks' heads and the media has run with it. I was down there a month ago, before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf. A month ago I was meeting with fishermen down there standing in the rain talking about what a potential crisis this could be.","And I don't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar. We talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I know whose ass to kick, right?","So, you know, this is not theater. Most of the decisions that I make on a day-to-day basis, I make because I have gathered the best information possible in very difficult situations, and my job is to figure out how can I move the federal government, the private sector, all the various players who are involved, to perform some very, very difficult tasks?","And I don't always have time to perform for the benefit of the cable shows. What I do have is dedication and commitment to make sure that the people who are actually being affected by this are going to get the best possible service from me. And as long as I'm [INTERVIEWED], that's the approach that I'm going to take to this job.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So this White House challenge; you had a thousand schools competing --","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: to have you give the commencement address. Why'd you pick Kalamazoo Central?","[INTERVIEWED]: This school is a great example of what's possible when you've got a public school, it's not in a wealthy community, it is diverse, and yet, because the community decided to invest by guaranteeing college tuition for any graduate here, you've got teachers and a principal who are dedicated and are willing to think out of the box, so they're not just bound by \"It's not in my contract,\" but they're doing all kinds of extra stuff.","[INTERVIEWER1]: You're not going to find a more friendly audience than you're going to have when you give this speech tonight. I watched their enthusiasm when they met you a few minutes ago.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Your job is to inspire them ","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]: and give them words of wisdom. What are you going to say to them?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I have to say, first of all, high-school audiences are the toughest, right, because  ","[INTERVIEWER1]: Why?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, when you're a teenager, you think you know more than just about anybody.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Not than [INTERVIEWED], though.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Probably not.","[INTERVIEWED]: But my main message to these kids is, number one, internalize a sense of excellence. You know, I think most of these kids have had a lot of support, telling them, \"Do well.\" But as soon as you get out of here, nobody's telling you, and you've got to want that on your own.","The second thing I'm going to tell them is, \"No excuses. Take responsibility and go out there and set your goals and then work for them. And understand that stuff doesn't come easy. You've got to work.\" This is Derek Jeter's --","[INTERVIEWER1]: Oh, I know.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- alma mater. And one of the things I'm going to remind them is that guy, you know, shagged a lot of grounders to end up being the captain of the Yankees. And so that's a message.","And then the third one is I also want kids to internalize the lesson of their community here, which is give back.","[INTERVIEWER1]: A couple of other quick topics.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Helen Thomas, the dean of Washington correspondents -- sits in the front row at the press conferences all the time -- announced her retirement today after some inflammatory comments about Israeli Jews.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Your reaction to her retirement? Your reaction to her comments?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, the comments were offensive. It's a shame, because Helen was somebody who had been a correspondent through I don't know how many s; was a real institution in Washington. But I think she made the right decision.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And is it something that taints her career, in your opinion?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, I think that those comments were out of line. And hopefully she recognizes that.","[INTERVIEWER1]: On a much lighter note, you're a sports fan.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So you must have watched with the rest of us the near-perfect game pitched by Armando Galarraga of the ","[INTERVIEWED]: Brutal.","[INTERVIEWER1]: -- Detroit Tigers the other night. Did Bud Selig make the right call in not awarding a perfect game and reversing Jim Joyce, the umpire's call?","[INTERVIEWED]: He made the right call in not awarding the perfect game, but I think that baseball is going to have to take a look at what football and basketball already decided ","[INTERVIEWER1]: More replay.","[INTERVIEWED]:  which is replay may, in some cases, be appropriate. I'm not advocating for it.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Are you a fan of that?","[INTERVIEWED]: I'm saying that you may have to take a look at it. But here's what was wonderful was how a potentially sour story ended up being, for me, an inspiring story. I think the class with which the pitcher handled it, the way that Joyce owned up to making a mistake, the way the whole team went out there the next day and said, \"You know what, we all make mistakes, but you've had a great career as an umpire,\" I thought that showed something about sportsmanship that you don't see enough in America these days.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah, for all the times I've had to explain bad sportsmanship to my kids, this was a teaching moment ","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah, that was a good example.","[INTERVIEWER1]: which was nice."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday0","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWER1]: And now to our exclusive conversation with [INTERVIEWED]. We sat down on the White House or at the White House on Monday to talk about the passage of his landmark health-care legislation and the nasty political tone in Washington these days. But I began by asking [INTERVIEWED] about Sunday's surprise visit to Afghanistan and why he felt it was important to go now and not earlier, when he was making his decision about a troop surge.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, keep in mind that as I was making the decision about troop strength, Afghanistan was still in the midst of an election or the post-election jockeying that was taking place, and it was very important to make sure that president of the United States doesn't look like he's parachuting in and changing the outcomes there.","And I thought it was important now not only to send a strong message to the troops that we are fully behind what they're doing -- I think we've seen some progress, and I wanted to mark that progress that's been made -- but also it's an important time for President Karzai. He has made some important steps in the right direction, in improving governance, reducing corruption. But there's a long way to go. And as our troops are on the front line, as they're going into places like Helmand, potentially into Kandahar, how the Afghan government performs is going to be just as important as how the Afghan national security forces perform.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I'm curious to hear you say there has been progress, because I was in Afghanistan with Secretary Gates back in December, and he told me, when he met with President Karzai, he talked about cracking down on corruption and cracking down on the drug trade, the very same topics you talked to President Karzai about. And I'm curious. Do you think he is listening? Is he getting it?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think he is listening, but I think that the progress is too slow. And what we've been trying to emphasize is the fierce urgency of now, that on all of these issues, whether it's making sure that farmers are actually getting help on their irrigation, whether it's emphasizing the need to make sure that police and prosecutors and judges are operating fairly, in terms of making sure that in these provinces that the governors are actually looking out for the best interests of their people and what kind of appointments are being made -- on all those issues, we've got to make progress faster, and we can't dilly-dally around.","And so, look, obviously this is a country that has been stressed and in war, in one way or another, for decades now. It's not going to transform itself overnight. But my hope is that President Karzai can recognize the incredible opportunity he has to be the father of a modern Afghanistan.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's talk about health-care reform; health-care law now we can talk about. It's seen as a huge victory for you, your presidency, for Democrats. It's a tough pill to swallow for Republicans. It's been described in a lot of different ways. Your vice president described it in colorful terms.","[INTERVIEWED]: [Laughs.]","[INTERVIEWER1]: How do you describe it?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it is a critical first step in making a health-care system that works for all Americans. It's not going to be the only thing. We're still going to have adjustments that have to be made to further reduce costs.","Now what we have is a system in place that preserves the employer-based system but says, number one, insurance companies, they have to behave themselves. We're going to have a private system in insurance, but you can't bar people from getting insurance because of pre-existing conditions. You can't drop people when they get sick and need coverage most. So you can't game the system.","The second thing is we've set up what's going to be called an exchange, but it's basically just a marketplace where individuals who right now have to go out on their own and buy insurance and have no leverage are suddenly going to be part of a pool of millions of people, including, by the way, members of Congress. And that gives them more buying power, the same way Wal-Mart has more purchasing power when it buys from its suppliers. That will force insurance rates down for the vast majority of people.","So what we now have is the basic principle that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should have to go without basic health care. My hope is that this year we're going to see some very concrete benefits that people get. Small businesses are going to get billions of dollars in tax breaks to provide insurance to their employees. Parents are going to be able to put their children on their health insurance up to the age of 26. Insurers are not going to be able to just drop people from coverage because they feel like it.","[INTERVIEWER1]: This version of health-care reform did not receive one Republican vote.","[INTERVIEWED]: Mmm-hmm. ","[INTERVIEWER1]: You almost have to say that again ","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: -- to let it really sink in: Not one Republican vote. And a lot of people wonder how a bill, or now a law, could be good for the American public in general when it didn't receive one single Republican vote and when a recent poll said 50 percent of people aren't in favor of this plan. How do you respond to that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, look, I think that the Republican Party made a calculated decision, a political decision, that they would not support whatever we did. There was a quote by a well-known Republican senator who said, \"This is going to be Obama's Waterloo. This is going to we're going to bring him down just the same way that we brought down Bill Clinton, by making sure that health care fails.\"","And I think that's unfortunate, because when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean, a lot of commentators have said, you know, this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. And so ","[INTERVIEWER1]: So you think it's all politics.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well ","[INTERVIEWER1]: It's not about the inner workings of the bill. It's all politics.","[INTERVIEWED]: I will say that any objective observer looking at this bill would say that this is a middle-of-the-road, centrist approach to providing coverage to people and making sure that we are also reducing costs.","I am frustrated that Republicans, who I think had an opportunity to help shape this bill, declined that opportunity. That's not to say that on specific provisions there might be legitimate concerns that they had, philosophical concerns that they had. Some of them, I think, sincerely believe that we should do more on this aspect of the bill or that aspect of the bill. But the overall architecture of it was actually something that was right down the middle.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Daniel Henninger, who's the deputy editorial-page editor of The Wall Street Journal, had an interesting take on it, [INTERVIEWED]. He said, \"If you produce a bill that even Olympia Snowe of Maine cannot vote for, you have not produced legislation for the generations. You've produced once-in-a-lifetime legislation that no Republican from any constituency across America can vote for.\" What's your response to that?","[INTERVIEWED]: And my response is -- well, number one, the Wall Street Journal editorial page generally isn't favorable to ","[INTERVIEWER1]: [Inaudible.] Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- much of what I do. But I think what's interesting is that if you actually break down the specifics of the bill, you will see that this historically has had a lot of Republican support.","There historically was a lot of Republican support for the notion of an individual mandate, that everybody should take responsibility. There was historic Republican support for the idea that we should make sure that entitlement reform exists within Medicare. There was historically a lot of Republican support for the idea of the exchange, which is the centerpiece of the bill.","So if you actually look at the particulars, these are all things that in the past others, including the Wall Street Journal editorial page, have endorsed. And yet, oddly ","[INTERVIEWER1]: What you keep coming back to is that the fix was in is what you're basically saying.","[INTERVIEWED]: I think what happened is that they made a calculation, which, if you are thinking in terms of short-term politics, you can see the argument. Their attitude is, \"Look, if we stop this bill, if we paint it as\" ","[INTERVIEWER1]: \"(We can ?) stop this president here.\"","[INTERVIEWED]: -- \"and we stop this president here, then that will give us a lot of political benefit in November.\"","What I've tried to say throughout is I will continually reach out to Republicans. I will continue to incorporate their ideas even when they don't vote for the ideas that I've presented. But what I'm not going to be dissuaded from is us going ahead and taking on these big challenges that are critical in terms of America's long-term economic health.","[INTERVIEWER1]: When we announced that we would be sitting down here with you at the White House today, our in box filled quickly with e- mails from viewers all around the country.","And Jeff in Minnesota asked a question I'd like your response to. He said, \"[INTERVIEWED], the CBO just issued a statement this past week that Social Security had reached the tipping point a full six years earlier than they originally had estimated. With that said, how can we believe their figures on your health-care plan that says we'll save $138 billion over 10 years?\"","[INTERVIEWED]: The reason that the tipping point was reached a little bit earlier is because the recession was so devastating. And presumably if growth picks up, then you'll see that adjustment made again.","Now, Social Security generally has to be reformed to ensure long- term sustainability. But in any given year or any given period, it might end up being way off from estimates because of something like the financial crisis.","Here's the interesting thing, though. The Congressional Budget Office historically has actually underestimated the savings whenever Medicare has been reformed, whenever we've made changes. And that was true the last time it was done. So we actually feel pretty optimistic that not only is $138 billion going to be saved in the first 10 years, but more significantly, a trillion dollars is going to be saved in the second 10 years.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's talk about where we are politically right now. And I don't have to tell you that this passage of this bill and turning it into law has left this country as politically divided as I think it has been in a long time. You might be able to cite some other examples. But the vitriol, the rhetoric, the sniping, the threats -- how are you possibly going to continue with any kind of legislative agenda when your opponents have said to you, \"I'm not going to cooperate with this president, with these Democrats, unless it's a matter of national security\"? How do you move on?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the rhetoric has been overheated and overblown. And this is what happens in Washington when you have a big debate. Suddenly the passage of this bill is Armageddon. And as I pointed out, the next day, after I signed it, I looked around and no asteroids had hit the planet -- (laughs) -- and no cracks had appeared in the earth.","This is a bill that is going to help a lot of people and help to lower costs of health care, but it's not a radical departure from what we've done in the past.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let's talk about faith a little bit, all right? There's been a lot of tension, and had been in the previous year, about your family's choice of a church here in Washington. As of yet, I haven't heard that you've settled on an exact church. Where do you stand on that? And how important a decision is it for your family?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, what we've decided for now is not to join a single church. And the reason is because Michelle and I have realized we are very disruptive to services. Now, there are a whole bunch of churches who would say it's okay, but when every other member of the congregation has to be magged any time that you attend -- so what we've done is we occasionally go across the street to St. John's, which is a church that a lot of presidents traditionally have gone to. We love -- the chapel up in Camp David is probably our favorite place to worship, because it's just families up at Camp David.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: There's a wonderful chaplain up there who does just a great job. And so usually when we go to Camp David, we go to church on Sundays there. And in the meantime, what we've done -- there was a prayer circle of pastors from across the country who, during the campaign, would say a prayer for me or send a devotional. And we've kept that habit up. And it's a wonderful group, because it's a mix of some very conservative pastors, some very liberal pastors, but all who pray for me and Michelle and the girls. And I get a daily devotional on my BlackBerry, which is a wonderful thing.","[INTERVIEWER1]: It's spirituality meets high tech.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah, (that's right ?).","[INTERVIEWER1]: That's pretty good.","Your girls have been here in the White House for more than a year now, along with Michelle. And when I spoke to Mrs. Obama not long ago, I said, \"You know, the normalcy thing, how's that going?\" Here comes summer.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: A lot of kids -- \"Okay, I'm going to summer camp.\"","[INTERVIEWED]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]: \"I'm going to go to sleep-away camp, Dad.\" Have you gotten that question?","[INTERVIEWED]: I have.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And how do you handle it?","[INTERVIEWED]: I have. And I handle it like every other dad, which is saying, \"Don't you want to spend it with me?\"","[INTERVIEWER1]:Yeah. \"No, I want to go to sleep-away camp, Dad.\"","[INTERVIEWED]:So the -- you know, the happiest thing about the past year and a half has been the girls' adjustment. They have just been terrific. They're doing well in school. They're not as constrained. They can wander around. Their Secret Service protection is a lot more low key. And so, you know, they've got soccer. They've got basketball. They go sleep over at their friends' houses.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: They've got -- you know, sometimes I've got 12 little girls screaming on the third floor of the White House. And they've made a great adjustment. And during the summer they're going to do what their friends are doing. If I wasn't in the Oval Office --","[INTERVIEWER1]: So it is possible to have a normal summer as a first daughter.","[INTERVIEWED]: It is. It is. Now, I get a little worried about them when they're teenagers, because I think that's the time when you're already embarrassed about your parents.","[INTERVIEWER1]: [Laughs.]","[INTERVIEWED]: And then imagine if your dad's --","[INTERVIEWER1]: He's president of the United States.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- in the newspaper every day and people are calling him an idiot. You know, so I feel a little worried about that. On the other hand, Malia and Sasha have just turned out to be unbelievably well-adjusted kids. And the thing that's most important to me is that they are so respectful of everybody and haven't gotten on any airs. And I attribute that directly to Michelle, because she wouldn't put up with any of that stuff.","[INTERVIEWER1]: All right, four names, okay? Butler, Duke, West Virginia, Michigan State. How's your bracket look, first of all?","[INTERVIEWED]: It is completely blown up.","[INTERVIEWER1]: [Laughs.]","[INTERVIEWED]: It is a sign that I was paying singular focus on health care.","[INTERVIEWER1]: That's your excuse, and you're sticking with it?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, I had done great in the first several rounds. I was in first place. I think ESPN calculated I was in the top 98th percentile.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWED]: And then every single --","[INTERVIEWER1]: Then the bottom fell out.","[INTERVIEWED]: Every single number one seed except Duke -- and Duke's the one number one seed I didn't pick --","[INTERVIEWER1]: To get to the Final Four.","[INTERVIEWED]: -- at least to get to the final eight.","[INTERVIEWER1]: But if you think about what we have left, you've got three schools that represent states you carried in the election.","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]: You've got one school that represents a state you did not carry.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So who are you picking?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I'm not going to pick now.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Oh, you have to pick now.","[INTERVIEWED]: No, you just --","[INTERVIEWER1]: When I was here for the Super Bowl, you picked then.","[INTERVIEWED]: You just explained to me why it was such bad politics. But I will say this. Just to show that I'm not biased, I actually think that West Virginia's got a great chance. And I did not win that state, but they've got a really good team.","[INTERVIEWER1]: So West Virginia over Duke --","[INTERVIEWED]: I think the winner of West Virginia-Duke will end up winning the championship.","[INTERVIEWER1]: You don't see a number five seed --","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't.","[INTERVIEWER1]: -- winning the championship. Good luck with that.","[INTERVIEWED]: Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]: We sat here a year ago, Super Bowl Sunday.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And at that time, we were talking about hope and change.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And you were going to change the dialogue and the tone in this country. And you said, \"Matt, it takes time.\"","[INTERVIEWED]: It does.","[INTERVIEWER1]: \"We have to build trust with the Republicans before the tone can change.\" Things now are worse.","[INTERVIEWED]: If you look at historically what happens is that a party that's out of power, oftentimes in those first few years out of power end up reacting very negatively. Their base ends up being very agitated. And it may take the next election or the next presidential election before things settle down.","I think what's important is that we recognize, A, we can disagree without being disagreeable; B, that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, have a responsibility as leaders to set the tone -- to not exaggerate what the other side is trying to do, to not suggest that they're bad people, to assume that they want what's best for America, even if we disagree on the particular approach. And so my hope is that the Republican leadership will take that tone. Certainly that's the tone that I want to take.","And I think that when you look at the issues that are still out there -- we still have to have an energy policy in this country that reduces our dependence on foreign oil; we've still got a broken immigration system; we still have financial regulatory reform, a major issue that I've been talking about now for several years, where we've got to figure out how to prevent the same kind of situation where a few reckless banks can bring down an entire economy.","And on each of these issues, I'm going to actively seek Republican support. But there are going to be areas where we disagree, and I will continue to maintain a tone where, if they've got good ideas, I'm going to take them.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: But if we disagree, then we'll fight it out --","[INTERVIEWER1]: We're talking a lot about --","[INTERVIEWED]: -- on the floor of the Senate or the House.","[INTERVIEWER1]: We're talking a lot about Republican disagreement. In your opinion, do Democrats deserve any of the blame for the tone in Washington right now?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, there's no doubt that Democrats are known to play the same game, which is to exaggerate the venality -- (laughs) -- of the other side. There are times where Republicans do things I don't like, but, you know, my working assumption is that they are doing what they think is best for the country. And I think there have been times where Democrats don't confer that same benefit of the doubt onto the Republicans, and I think that's a tone that all of us should take.","[INTERVIEWER1]: When I look at the division right now, I was thinking of President Bush in preparing for this interview. And I remember, he came to office saying, \"I want to be the uniter.\" And by the end of his second term, people were calling him the opposite. They were saying, \"You are a divider.\" And I'm sure President Bush would argue that the country was divided because he had to tackle some very difficult issues and make tough choices.","Having been through what you've just been through with health- care reform, do you now have a different opinion of the job that George Bush did in this office?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I think that, having sat in the Oval Office as president, I am much more sympathetic to all presidents generally, because what is true is that there are big, tough decisions that you make, and you know that unless you try to avoid those problems, whatever you decide is going to make some people happy and some people unhappy. And I think there are some things that George Bush has done that were smart and the right thing to do. I've said that before.","I do think that we now have a pattern of polarization, not just with George Bush, but also previous to George Bush with Bill Clinton, where the political culture gets so wound up. Frankly, Matt, it gets spun up partly because of the way the media covers politics these days, in the 24/7 news cycle and the cable chatter and the talk radio and the Internet and the blogs, all of which tend to try to feed the most extreme sides of any issue instead of trying to narrow differences and solve problems.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Is it solvable?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I do think it's solvable, because I think that when I go around the country and I talk to folks, they don't think in ideological terms. They don't think in terms of Republican- Democrat. They think in terms of \"Is this good for my family? Will this help my kid go to college? Is this going to help me keep a good job that pays the rent or pays my mortgage?\"","And if we can demonstrate, as an administration, that, regardless of whatever the day-to-day news cycle is saying, that we're staying focused on the big picture and helping families, and the results are good, then I think that will show that it's possible to be principled and stick to your convictions and not worry about the polls, and ultimately be rewarded politically. And, you know, nothing succeeds like success in this town. If other politicians watch and it turns out that taking a common-sense approach to problems works, suddenly, lo and behold, you might see more of that.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Let me ask you about the tea party. This is a movement, this is an organization, that didn't exist before you were president. And now they're in the headlines almost every day. Some say they are a legitimate movement. Others think they're a fringe group. Where do you fall?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, I think that it is a still loose amalgam of forces. There's a part of the tea-party movement that actually did exist before I was elected. We saw some of it leading up to my election. There are some folks who just weren't sure whether I was born in the United States -- (laughs) -- whether I was a socialist, right? So there's that segment of it, which I think is just dug in ideologically. And that strain has existed in American politics for a long time.","Then I think that there's a broader circle around that core group of people who are legitimately concerned about the deficit, who are legitimately concerned that the federal government may be taking on too much. And last year a bunch of the emergency measures we had to take in terms of dealing with the bank crisis, bailing out the auto industry, fed that sense that things are out of control. And I think those are folks who have legitimate concerns. And so I wouldn't paint in broad brush and say that, you know, everybody who's involved or have gone to a tea-party rally or a meeting are somehow on the fringe. Some of them, I think, have some mainstream legitimate concerns.","And, you know, my hope is that as we move forward and we're tackling things like the deficit and imposing a freeze on domestic spending and taking steps that show we're sincere about dealing with our long-term problems, that some of that group will dissipate. There's still going to be a group at their core that question my legitimacy or question the Democratic Party generally or question people who they consider to be against them in some way. And that group we're probably not going to convince."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstoday1","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. We're here in the Map Room at the White House with the 44th [INTERVIEWED]."," [INTERVIEWED], it's great to be with you. How you doing?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm doing great, Matt, thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So you've been [INTERVIEWED] 12 days. So let me ask the question that's on everyone's mind right now: How's it going living with your mother-in-law?","[INTERVIEWED]. Fortunately, I love my mother-in-law and","[INTERVIEWER1]. I'm just asking. I'm not trying to start trouble.","[INTERVIEWED]. She is actually--she defends me whenever I screw up. So, Michelle, you know, she's about to come down hard, my mother-in-law comes in, intercedes so","[INTERVIEWER1]. Everything's copacetic.","[INTERVIEWED]. The longer she stays, the better off I'm going to be.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I was driving over here, [INTERVIEWED]; I was thinking about this enormous transition that you've been through taking on the reins as Commander in Chief, Mrs. Obama becoming the First Lady. But you've got a daughter, 10, and a daughter, 7, and this is a huge game-changer for them as well. How are they doing?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, they--I said this, I think, in an earlier interview--people think I'm cool; nobody is cooler than my two girls. They just seem to take whatever comes with, you know, happiness and steadiness. And they're loving school, they're making friends--in fact, they've got some friends from school over today--and they've already joined some clubs. And Sasha, you know, I think maybe to endear myself to her, she decided she wanted to join a basketball team, so what more could I want?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you getting to take part in some of the routines? I was thinking, you've been on the road basically for 2 years, although you got home a lot. Now, you're all under the same room, basically, for 12 days. Are you there for breakfast? Do you get to read them a story at night, tuck them in bed? How's it going?","[INTERVIEWED]. It's the best deal of this whole thing, is it turns out I've got this nice home office. And at the end of the day, I can come home--even if I've got more work to do--I can have dinner with them; I can help them with their homework; I can tuck them in. If I've got to go back to the office, I can. But I'm seeing them now more than any time in the last 2 years, and that's been great for the whole family.","[INTERVIEWER1]. President Bush said in his last press conference here at the White House, he said he wasn't sure when it would happen for you, but there would be a moment, perhaps in the Oval Office, when you would stop and realize, I am [INTERVIEWED] of the United States. I'm curious, have you had that moment?","[INTERVIEWED]. There have been a couple of times, some wonderful, some sobering. Whenever you take that walk down the Colonnade and you go to the Oval Office, I do think you get this sense of the history that you're now a part of. Some sobering moments: having to sign letters for troops who have died and sending letters to their families, where you realize every decision you make counts, and you don't have time to spend a lot of time on inconsequential stuff. You've got to focus on, at this point, putting people back to work, but also reminding yourselves that you've got hundreds of thousands of people around the world who are putting themselves in harm's way, and you're the Commander in Chief.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You talk about sobering moments. Even as a Senator and member of the Foreign Relations Committee you were getting intelligence briefings, on the campaign trail also, and during the transition. But now, from what I understand, every day you go down there and there's that intelligence briefing on your desk, and it's got to contain some pretty sobering stuff.","There are millions, tens of millions of people watching this broadcast right now, [INTERVIEWED]. If they were to have access to the same information you have now on a daily basis, how much less sleep would we all be getting?","[INTERVIEWED]. Here's what I think is important for everybody to understand: We've got real threats, and we have to remain vigilant, but the quality of our Armed Forces has never been better. When you meet the people who are charged with keeping America safe, it gives you enormous confidence. They are on the case day in, day out, with extraordinary professionalism. But there is no doubt that we have to make sure that we don't let up, because there are people who would be willing to do us harm.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let's talk about some of those men and women who are serving this country overseas in Afghanistan, other locations, in Iraq. And I'm sure they're watching today; it's a big event for the Armed Services. And a lot of those people have a vested interest in one of your campaign promises to end this war and get them home as soon--within 16 months or so--as humanly possible.","So when you look at them, can you say that a substantial number of them will be home in time for next Super Bowl Sunday?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I mean, we're going to roll out in a very formal fashion what our intentions are in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan. But in conversations that I've had with the Joint Chiefs, with people--the commanders on the ground, I think that we have a sense, now that the Iraqis just had a very significant election, with no significant violence there, that we are in a position to start putting more responsibility on the Iraqis, and that's good news for not only the troops in the field, but their families who are carrying an enormous burden.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The economy, I mean, people are going to watch this game today; they're going to blow off some steam; they're going to have a good time. But a lot of them are going to go to bed, they're going to wake up tomorrow morning, and the worry is going to start again. They're going to worry about losing their jobs and their homes and putting their kids through school and making ends meet.","How much worse is the economy going to get, [INTERVIEWED], before it gets better?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we're going to be in for a tough several months. We've got to get this economic recovery plan passed. We've got to start putting people back to work. We're going to have to straighten out the credit markets and make sure that credit is flowing to businesses and individuals so that they can start investing and hiring people again.","And, you know, as soon as Congress moves forward on the recovery plan, we are going to be also releasing our plan for the financial sector and regulating the financial sector. I have confidence we're going to be able to get the economy back on track, but it's going to take a number of months before we stop falling, and then a little bit longer for us to get back on track.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And when it comes to the stimulus plan, the House passed its version last week, but without one Republican vote. That disappointed a lot of people. The Senate takes up their version of the measure starting tomorrow. How important is gaining some more Republican support for that? How big a test of your leadership at this early stage of your Presidency?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, the important thing is getting the thing passed. And I've done extraordinary outreach, I think, to Republicans, because they have some good ideas, and I want to make sure that those ideas are incorporated.","I am confident that by the time we actually have the final package on the floor that we are going to see substantial support. And people are going to say: this is a serious effort; it has no earmarks. We're going to be trimming out things that are not relevant to putting people back to work right now.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can you predict a number of Republican votes","[INTERVIEWED]. No, of course not.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You wouldn't do that?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I wouldn't. But I'm confident that--look, I think that the House Democrats actually adopted a number of ideas that the House Republicans had offered. Obviously, the House Republicans wanted to make a statement. Now it moves to the Senate. We've got 535 people who feel it's their responsibility to represent their constituents and make their voices heard.","So this is--democracy is always a somewhat messy process. But the thing I want all of them to remember, and the thing I'm thinking about every single day, is the thousands of people who are being laid off of their jobs right now. They can't afford politics as usual, and old habits are hard to break, but now is the time to break them because we've got an urgent situation.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let's lighten up a little bit. Let's move towards sports, okay? You came out and you said, \"Look, in college football I'm not crazy about the current system for determining a national champion.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. This is true.","[INTERVIEWER1]. \"I'd rather see a playoff system like in professional baseball or professional football.\"","So will you look into the camera right now and talk to the people of Florida and their 27 electoral votes, and tell them that the Gators are not the national champions of football?","[INTERVIEWED]. Where's the camera, right here?","[INTERVIEWER1]. There you go.","[INTERVIEWED]. Congratulations, Gators, on an outstanding season. Tebow is great. Wouldn't you feel better if you had beat every team that was out there through a playoff system?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Twenty-seven electoral votes.","[INTERVIEWED]. I love you. I think they could have taken on anybody through the playoff system. By the way, one of our Secret Service guys, his son is a tackle on the Florida Gators, so, you know, I've got soft spot for the Gators.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You've got a connection.","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let's talk about this game today. You came out--and most Presidents don't pick a team--you came right out and you said, \"Look, I know the Rooneys. They've been good friends of mine; they endorsed me.\" I think you got the AFC championship ball","[INTERVIEWED]. I did.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So you said, \"Other than my dear Bears, they're closest to my heart.\" But I'm having a hard time understanding how you, of all people, wouldn't associate with the Cardinals.","[INTERVIEWED]. Underdog","[INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, it is a Cinderella story. The team that came from nowhere to the big game, the audacity of hope.","[INTERVIEWED]. Not to mention the fact that Kurt Warner is close to my age.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right, exactly. How can you turn your back on the Cardinals?","[INTERVIEWED]. I love Kurt Warner's story. I love--Larry Fitzgerald seems like just a wonderful young man. It's a great story. But Rooney didn't just endorse me; that guy was out going to steel plants campaigning for me. Franco Harris was out waving towels at my rallies.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have a Terrible Towel in the other room?","[INTERVIEWED]. I do, actually, so","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to be waving them at the party?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not going to be rubbing it in. We've got some Arizona Congressmen here, and I may need their vote on the recovery package.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Give me a score. What's the score going to be in this game?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, it's tough to predict, but I think the Steelers are going to eke it out in a close one.","[INTERVIEWER1]. All right. Well, last year, you predicted the Patriots over my Giants. I don't have a question here; I just wanted to rub that in a little bit.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm still wondering how the guy made that catch.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The Hail Mary?","[INTERVIEWED]. He has some Stickum on his helmet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. David Tyree.","[INTERVIEWED]. He had Stickum on his helmet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. They just dissected that play in about a 5-minute segment on the show.","[INTERVIEWED]. It was one of the greatest plays in pro football history.","[INTERVIEWED]'s BlackBerry","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let's talk about the BlackBerry, all right? You got to keep it.","[INTERVIEWED]. I did.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I see it? Do you have it?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, I didn't bring it down here.","[INTERVIEWER1]. No?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, it's like Inspector Gadget; you know, the--if you touched it, it might blow up.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I kind of envision that it's like Q in the James Bond. Did they give you, like, fingerprint recognition technology or something?","[INTERVIEWED]. The works. The works. It turns into a car if I have to make a quick getaway.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How many people have that e-mail address?","[INTERVIEWED]. A handful. Look, there are security issues involved, and so we've got to make sure that I'm not creating a situation where, you know, potentially people can comprise our system somehow.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But, like, world leaders, can they contact you on that BlackBerry?","[INTERVIEWED]. Typically, world leaders are going to be contacting me through the Oval Office. They know how to reach me there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sasha and Malia?","[INTERVIEWED]. Sasha and Malia can always contact me.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Oprah?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well","[INTERVIEWER1]. Maybe. You're not going to hook me up, are you?","[INTERVIEWED]. Matt, do you want one?","[INTERVIEWER1]. No, I want your e-mail address. I want to communicate with you during the game.","[INTERVIEWED]. I like your son; I might give it to him. I'm not going to give it to you. Jack, he might get one.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Jack, give it to your papa, okay?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let me end on some--not only did you just become [INTERVIEWED], obviously, that carries a certain amount of fame with it. But you have achieved a certain rock star status outside of that.","[INTERVIEWED]. Outside of my house.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, let me show you. This is the current issue of US Weekly, and here's a great picture of","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, it's a beautiful","[INTERVIEWER1]. you and Michelle and your daughters. The reason I bring this up--I think it's funny--it's a great picture. But I want to show you the cover. Look what they did: they took you off the cover; they cut you out of it.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it's a little hurtful.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You got replaced by Jessica Simpson.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, who is in a weight battle, apparently. Yes, oh, well.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Message to the American People","[INTERVIEWER1]. What would you like to say to the tens of millions of people who are watching this game today?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, listen, have a wonderful time. The Super Bowl is one of the finest American traditions. I want to give a special shout-out to our troops overseas who are going to be watching this, because you allow not just this game to take place, but our liberties to be preserved, and we're very grateful to you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], it's a pleasure. Thanks for welcoming us to the White House. Enjoy the game.","[INTERVIEWED]. Have a great time.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you. We certainly will.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll see if I have to eat my words again next year.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We'll see; we'll call you tomorrow, okay? I'll e-mail you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You talked a lot during the campaign and in your Inaugural Address about bipartisanship, getting people to work together, about unity. And then people watched this vote on the stimulus package in the House, and they saw that not one Republican voted for it. What would you say to the people who were watching that speech of yours at home and maybe the 2 million people who were freezing out there on the Mall, who were saying, \"You know what, we thought we could change, and maybe we were naive\"?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, listen, it's only been 10 days. People have to recognize that it's going to take some time for trust to be built not only between Democrats and Republicans, but between Congress and the White House, between the House and the Senate. You know, we've had a dysfunctional political system for a while now. And the fact that we have been able to move what is by all accounts a historic piece of legislation through this quickly, and that the Senate is having a serious debate about it, and we still expect it to be on my desk for signature before's Day, is quite an achievement. But it's going to take time for people to start getting used to the fact that we don't have to score political points on every issue. Once in a while, we can take the politics out of it and just focus on getting the job done for the American people.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You were pretty agitated this past week when the news broke of these Wall Street bonuses paid out in 2008, even as some of the firms that paid them out had their hands out looking for Federal assistance. And is there some--is there an audit underway right now, or can there be an audit that takes place to make sure that none of the taxpayers' monies goes to anything but stabilizing these firms?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's what I've asked my Treasury Secretary to do: to put together a clear set of guidelines. If a bank or a financial institution is getting relief, then they've got to abide by certain conditions. Now, as I said when I blew off a little steam in the Oval Office, the American people don't resent folks for getting rich. That's part of the American way. But they do expect that you share in the pain, and they do expect that if taxpayers are having to pony up the bill, then these folks are going to show some restraint. Obviously, they're not doing it on their own. We're going to have to make sure that it's part of the package that we put forward in terms of how we spend money in the future.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, we've seen some crazy examples; I mean, when the auto executives arrived in Washington for those hearings in Congress in those private jets, these bonuses. The American people might worry that the bailout, you know, could be off course, because if the money is going to people who simply are out of touch, it's not a confidence builder.","[INTERVIEWED]. Right. Well, and that's why it's my job as [INTERVIEWED] and Congress's job to make sure that there are some rules of the road that people are going to abide by, and that we've got transparency and accountability, that this stuff is being posted. And one of the things that we're going to do is put together an independent board on the recovery package","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. that actually looks at these programs and the money before it goes out the door. Nothing is worse than finding out after the fact","[INTERVIEWER1]. When it's too late","[INTERVIEWED]. when it's too late that money has been wasted. We're going to make sure that on the front end, this stuff has been evaluated.","[INTERVIEWER1]. It's hard to estimate because there are so many different numbers going around there, [INTERVIEWED], but it seems like somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 to $350 billion in TARP money has already gone out and been spent. And you're hearing more and more people saying, it's going to take much, much more. I'm curious, though, have you heard anyone credible be able to put a real figure on how much it's going to take to fix this, and, B, who can say, \"And this money will work; it will fix the economy\"?","[INTERVIEWED]. Here's what I've heard from a range of economists across the political spectrum. The banks, because of mismanagement, because of huge risk-taking, are now in very vulnerable positions. We can expect that we're going to have to do more to shore up the financial system. We also are going to have to make sure that we set up financial regulations so that not only does this never happen again, but you start having some sort of trust in how the credit markets work again.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. So all that's going to have to happen on parallel tracks. How much it's going to end up costing taxpayers is going to depend in part on how well we manage the process, how well we are overseeing the spending. And that's why I've said before we put out more money, what we want to do is set up very clear guidelines. That's the charge of my Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner; that's the charge that Larry Summers, my national economic adviser, has. And I do have confidence that we're going to be able to get it right, but it's not going to be overnight, and there's no silver bullets to this. The fact of the matter is, is that we are suffering from a massive hangover from a binge of risk-taking.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And it's still getting worse.","[INTERVIEWED]. And that's still getting worse. And it's going to take some time for us to be able to dig ourselves out of this hole.","[INTERVIEWER1]. One of those parallel tracks you talked about--are you planning in the near future to announce an idea that will buy up the toxic debt from the balance sheets of these banks with perhaps a so-called bad bank, similar to what happened with the savings and loan crisis? And if so, what do you think that could cost? Because Chuck Schumer came out and said, since we don't really know what those debts are worth, this could cost $4 trillion.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, it's a--we're not going to be spending $4 trillion worth of taxpayer money. It's conceivable that we have more--not only is it conceivable, it is likely that the banks have not fully acknowledged all the losses that they're going to experience. They're going to have to write down those losses, and some banks won't make it. Other banks are going to make sure that we strengthen. All deposits are going to be safe for ordinary people, but we're going to have to wring out some of these bad assets and","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to set up a \"bad bank\" or whatever it would be called?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I don't want to preempt an announcement next week. And there's a lot of technical aspects to it, and if I say that we're doing one thing, then the markets might interpret it differently from what it ends up being. But the basic principle: that we're going to have to see some of this debt written down; that the Government is going to have to support some banks; that others that are not viable--essentially, that we're going to have to do something with those assets.","You know, that's all going to be part of a overall plan that not only strengthens the credit markets, but more importantly, puts people back to work, because that's what people are experiencing right now. They're seeing their jobs lost every single day. Their neighbors, friends, or, you know, coworkers are losing their jobs. And what they want to know is, is that Congress and the White House has a single-minded focus on making sure that people can be put back to work.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let me ask you about a exit strategy, and I'm not talking about in Iraq here, although there's been a lot of talk about that. But do you have an exit strategy for this bailout? In other words, at some point will you say, \"Wait a minute, we've spent this amount of money; we're not seeing the results; we've got to change course dramatically.\" Is there that kind of strategy in place?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, if we are doing things properly then what you'll start seeing is slowly trust get rebuilt, banks' balance sheets will start to strengthen; they'll start lending to each other; they'll start lending to companies; they'll start lending to small businesses. There will be some institutions that continue to be weak, and we're going to have to do something with them. Over time, as the market confidence is restored, then what we can do is start getting rid of some of these assets, some of the stock the taxpayers now have in some of these companies start being worth more. We sell them off to private parties, and taxpayers can recoup that money.","So you know, it's going to have to happen in stages. The key thing, I think, for the public right now is they have to know that I'm going to be spending all my time making sure that their money is not wasted, because I'm going to be, ultimately, accountable. Look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got 4 years and","[INTERVIEWER1]. You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happened.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's exactly right. And, you know, a year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in 3 years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition. And I welcome that responsibility, because I think now's the time for us to start shifting and thinking about long-term economic growth.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let me go on quickly if I can to some other subjects. You signed an Executive order in your first week that says you'll close the military detention center at Guantanamo within a year. So the clock is ticking. And already you've heard the criticism that you don't know what you're going to do with the 245 prisoners being held there. Peter Hoekstra, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the decision to close Guantanamo by a year from now \"places hope ahead of reality. It sets an objective without a plan to get there.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me say this. We had a long campaign between myself and John McCain. One thing we did not disagree on--in fact, something that John McCain was as adamant as I was, was that we needed to close Guantanamo. It's the right thing to do. Ultimately, it will make us safer. You've already seen in the reaction around the world a different sense of America by us taking this action.","Now, is it going to be easy? No, because we've got a couple of hundred of hardcore militants that, unfortunately, because of some problems that we had previously in gathering evidence, we may not be able to try in ordinary courts, but we don't want to release. How we structure that is something that I'm going to do carefully. Our lawyers are reviewing it. I have absolute confidence that, ultimately, we're going to be able to find a mechanism, with the cooperation of the international community, with the cooperation of some very smart Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, a former JAG who knows this stuff well. I have confidence that we're going to be able to find a solution to this problem.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all worried--and some of these people may be released, the ones that seem to be less of a threat. But if one of those people that's released goes back and takes part in the planning of or carrying out of an attack against U.S. interests, you're going to have a Willie Horton times 100 situation on your hands. How are you going to deal with that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course I'm worried about it. Look, the--I have to make the very best judgments I can make in terms of what's going to keep the American people safe, and is what--what's going to uphold our Constitution and our traditions of due process. And what I'm convinced of is that we can balance those interests in a way that makes all of us proud, but also assures that we're not attacked.","Now, can I guarantee--or can anybody guarantee, for that matter--that some of the people who have already been released--keep in mind, I mean, the Bush administration released a whole bunch of folks out of Guantanamo, some of them have rejoined some of these militant organizations--can we guarantee that they're not going to try to participate in another attack? No.","But what I can guarantee is that if we don't uphold our Constitution and our values, that over time that will make us less safe and that will be a recruitment tool for organizations like Al Qaida. That's what I've got to keep my eye on.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let me ask you about Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said this is going to be a long slog, and that it's our greatest military challenge. You're going to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops in there. Can that make a difference in a country that's had 2,000 years of trouble and that's been called the \"graveyard of empires\"?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I haven't definitively authorized the 30,000 troops, although planning has been done. And I think that it is very important that we have enough troops on the ground that we're not putting those who are already there at risk, and that we can accomplish some core missions.","We are not going to be able to rebuild Afghanistan into a Jeffersonian democracy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So what's the mission there now?","[INTERVIEWED]. What we can do is make sure that Afghanistan is not a safe haven for Al Qaida. What we can do is make sure that it is not destabilizing neighboring Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons. And that's going to require not only military efforts, but also diplomatic efforts. It's also going to require development efforts in a coordinated fashion. And that's why I've asked the Joint Chiefs that have produced a review. David Petraeus is reviewing the situation there. We assigned Richard Holbrooke as a special envoy to the region. They are all working together. They will be presenting to me a plan.","But the key is the point you made. We've got to have a clear objective. And there's been drift in Afghanistan over the last couple of years. That's something that we intend to fix this year.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Two last questions. One is about security, not national security, but your own. There was an article in the Washington Post that some of the big donors who were invited to some of your Inaugural functions were--I think the word they used was \"shocked\" by how easy it was to get access to you. And they expressed concerns that not enough was being done to secure you. First of all, just your opinion on that.","[INTERVIEWED]. I have complete confidence in Secret Service. These guys and gals are unbelievably professional, they know what they're doing, and I basically do what they tell me to do. Now, sometimes I'm the first one to admit that it chafes a little bit being inside this bubble. It's the hardest adjustment of being [INTERVIEWED], not being able to just take a walk or","[INTERVIEWER1]. I watched you walk down the halls a couple of times, and there's someone in front of you and someone behind you.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's exactly right. So it's tough. But I have complete confidence in their ability to keep me safe.","Peanut Butter Products Recall/Food and Drug Administration","[INTERVIEWER1]. Last question. There's been a massive peanut butter products recall in this country over the last several weeks. Most of the products track--trace to one plant down in Georgia that has a bit of a history of sending out products even though there have been traces of Salmonella found.","The question--the obvious question people want to know, is the FDA doing its job?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that the FDA has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch. And so we're going to be doing a complete review of FDA operations. I don't want to prejudge this particular case, but there have been enough instances over the last several years, and at bare minimum we should be able to count on our Government keeping our kids safe when they eat peanut butter. That's what Sasha","[INTERVIEWER1]. It seems a simple thing.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's what Sasha eats for lunch, probably three times a week. And I don't want to have to worry about whether she's going to get sick as a consequence of having her lunch.","So we are going to make sure that we retool the FDA, that it is operating in a highly professional fashion, and most importantly, that we prevent these things, as opposed to trying to catch them after they've already occurred.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I really appreciate your time.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you.","[There was a break in the interview, and then it resumed as follows.]","The First Family's Transition to Life in the White House","[INTERVIEWER1]. Has there been any surprise in terms of life in the White House? Is there something that the White House has you didn't think they had or doesn't have you thought they did have?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, the bowling alley doesn't seem to be improving my game. That's the one thing I've noticed.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Have you used it?","[INTERVIEWED]. We did. We took the kids down, and I wanted to use the bumpers, but Michelle said that's only","[INTERVIEWER1]. If it doesn't work, you had the gutters at least? That's good. It's good to know you're not cheating in bowling, good. You're playing horse on the basketball court.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's right, playing horse on the basketball court. There is a horseshoe pitch out there, so I'm going to have to practice that a little bit.","[INTERVIEWER1]. After 12 days--it's a minuscule amount of time--are you and Mrs. Obama more or less confident that you can keep a real sense of normalcy in the girls' lives?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, I think that we're going to be okay. Look, Malia is 10, so 3 years from now, she's 13. Who knows what happens to teenagers.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. But if there are a pair of kids who can handle this weird fishbowl, it's those two. They're just even keeled; they're happy, cheerful--the prettiest, respectful kids.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You're starting off from the right place.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's exactly right. And having--this is where having the mother-in-law, you know, who won't take any guff from them, really helps. So we feel pretty good about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, we all wish you luck.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Go enjoy the game.","[INTERVIEWED]. Good.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thanks for your time. I really appreciate it."," "," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstodayshowcovingtonlouisiana","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. Two of the volunteers this morning are [INTERVIEWED2]  and [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWED2], good to see you again; [INTERVIEWED1], nice to have you here.","[INTERVIEWED]. Hi, Matt.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Eight trips to this region for you since September 2d six, I believe, for you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Give me a sense of the biggest change you've seen over the past 6 or 7 weeks in this area.","[INTERVIEWED2]. I think we've seen the spirits change. I mean, the storm hit; it was an overwhelming moment for a lot of people. And then they're beginning to realize, people the local people are beginning to realize there's hope; there's a chance to rebuild lives. And a lot of people care about them.","I've seen some infrastructure change. The debris is being cleared, and roads are being rebuilt. And it's a remarkable spirit here in this part of the world. I mean, people say, \"Look, we're going to rebuild our lives,\" and they've realized a lot of people from around the country want to help them.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And as you see the progress, you also see how much remains to be done.","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Schools still need to be reopened ","[INTERVIEWED]. That's true.","[INTERVIEWER1].  health facilities and all that sort of thing.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm worried about the schools. I'm really interested in that. But I'm also proud that so many people have gone to school, so many parents have put their kids in school wherever they are, if they're in Houston or Fort Worth or Baton Rouge or wherever, and I think that's really important.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So much more visibility on your part, [INTERVIEWED2], following Hurricane Rita and, as I mentioned, the eight trips to this region, as compared to what was seen as a slow and inefficient Federal response after Hurricane Katrina. Is this one of those situations where you're trying to get a second chance to make a first impression?","[INTERVIEWED2]. I do my job as best I can. One of the things that we do is we respond to crises. And as I told the people, if I didn't respond well enough, we're going to learn the lessons. If there's any mistakes made at the Federal level, I, of course, accept responsibility for them.","On the other hand, there's a lot of good that's taken place, a lot of people are working hard. We had chopper drivers pulling people off roofs. We had, you know, people working long hours to save lives, and the story will unfold. I mean, the facts of the story will come out over time, and the important thing is for Federal, State, and local governments to adjust and to respond.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I talked to a prominent Democrat in Louisiana who has said that this type of appearance, while it's great to see you guys rolling up your sleeves and grabbing a hammer and helping with this piece of wall here, that it's a photo op, and they want to see a plan on paper, your plan to rebuild this region. Do you have that kind of a plan?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Well, Matt, you see, I don't think Washington ought to dictate to New Orleans how to rebuild. I guess we have a different philosophy than whoever the prominent Democrat was you spoke to. Last night Laura and I had dinner with Mayor Nagin and a group of distinguished New Orleans citizens from all walks of life. And my message to them was, \"We will support the plan that you develop.\"","The point is, is that it comes from the local folks. And I recognize there's an attitude in Washington that says, \"We know better than the local people.\" That's just not the attitude I have.","[INTERVIEWER1]. There was recently a loan package approved by Congress, a billion dollars in emergency loans for the States hardest hit by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. That's the good news. Some Democrats complain that there was wording taken out of that loan package, a forgiveness clause that has traditionally been included in loan packages in the past. And they're wondering why these three States were singled out. Would you ask Congress to go back into that legislation and reinstate the forgiveness clause?","[INTERVIEWED2]. I think Congress what Congress said was is that the previous loans were limited to a relatively small amount of money. These loans are much greater loans, and that what Congress has said is, \"You'll have 5 years to repay, plus an additional 5 years to repay.\" And so I think it's a kind of package that Congress was comfortable with giving, and I was happy to sign it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Carolyn Maloney, who, as you know, is a Democrat from New York, a Congresswoman, said ","[INTERVIEWED2]. You're quoting a lot of Democrats today, Matt. That's interesting. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. She said that we aren't asking the people of Iraq to pay back the money we're spending there. Why are we asking the people of the gulf coast, requiring them to pay back this money? How would you respond to that?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Well, the people of Iraq are paying a heavy price for terrorism. A lot of people are dying, Matt. These people are working hard to establish democracy, and they're paying a serious price. Look, I understand there are a lot of politics. One of the things that I suggested was we keep the politics out of New Orleans and Mississippi as we all work together to rebuild these communities. And we've got people here who volunteered their time, from all over the country, and they didn't say, you know, \"I'm a Democrat, and I'm going to work here,\" or, \"I'm a Republican, and I'm going to come and work here.\" They said, \"I'm an American that wants to contribute.\"","And the reason why Laura and I are here is because we want to encourage other Americans to help somebody find shelter or help somebody find food or to continue to express the incredible compassion that the country saw when displaced persons moved from this part of the world and are scattered around the country.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Which is a good point. So in other words, if someone says to you, \"Okay, you're moving a wall today, and it's a photo op,\" but if that inspires someone else in another community to move a wall and grab a hammer, then that's mission accomplished?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's right. And also, this gives us a chance to thank the people who do this all the time, not just in a crisis situation but who volunteer with Habitat in their towns wherever they are across the country or volunteer in a million other ways working in schools or other ways. And this is really, really important, and it's very American to step out and help.","[INTERVIEWED2]. I understand there's a lot of politics, and you keep talking about this politician or that politician. I think our job is to elevate this whole process out of normal politics. Frankly, we're supposed to ","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that possible, though? I mean, isn't it inevitable it will be bogged down in politics?","[INTERVIEWED2]. It depends on who asks the questions, I guess. I think most Americans aren't interested in this kind of politics. I think most Americans are interested in contributing. And the amazing thing about Katrina and Rita is that there has been a fantastic response by people from all walks of life that have welcomed a neighbor and said, \"Brother, what can I do to help you?\" Or, \"How can I show you love?\" And I applaud the \"Today\" show and Habitat for Humanity and your partners in being a part of a larger picture of helping people rebuild their lives. It's a great contribution. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. While I have you here and while you don't have a hammer in your hand, can I ask you well, you have it in your belt about some things going on in Washington?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A lot of criticism coming for your nominee to the Supreme Court, Harriet Miers, from conservatives, people like Trent Lott and Pat Buchanan and George Will and Bill Kristol. Were you taken off-guard a little bit, caught by surprise by the amount of criticism you're getting for Judge Miers?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Well, you know, I made a decision to put somebody on the Court who hadn't been a part of what they call the judicial monastery. In other words  I listened, by the way, to people in the Senate who suggested, \"Why don't you get somebody from the outside.\" And I figured that people are going to kind of question whether or not it made sense to bring somebody from outside the court.","I would remind those, one, that Harriet is an extraordinary, accomplished woman who has done a lot. As a matter of fact, she has consistently ranked as one of the top 50 women lawyers in the United States, that she has broken the glass ceiling. She has served as a great example. She is a brilliant person. And that just because she hasn't served on the bench doesn't mean that she can't be a great Supreme Court Justice.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But you know, conservatives are worried about what's going to happen when she gets on the bench, and they're worried about what's going to happen in the future. And I get the feeling and I'm not sure if this is too strong I get the feeling some conservatives, [INTERVIEWED2], are feeling let down by you, and they're thinking they've supported you for so long and when an issue that is so important to them comes up, that you let them down. How would you answer that?","[INTERVIEWED2]. My answer is Harriet Miers is going to be confirmed, and people will get to see why I put her on the bench. She is an extraordinary woman. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. You said she is the most qualified candidate for the job ","[INTERVIEWED2]. As I told you.","[INTERVIEWER1].  would you agree with that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You had pushed for a woman to be a nominee.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's right. And I know Harriet well. I know how accomplished she is. I know how many times she's broken the glass ceiling, herself. She's a role model for young women around our country.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Some are suggesting ","[INTERVIEWED]. Not only that, she's very deliberate and thoughtful and will bring dignity to wherever she goes, but certainly to the Supreme Court she'll be really excellent.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Some are suggesting there's a little possible sexism in the criticism of Judge Miers. How do you feel about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's possible. I think that's possible. I think she is so accomplished, and I know I think people are not looking at her accomplishments and not realizing that she was the first elected woman to be the head of the Texas Bar Association, for instance, and all the other things. She was the first woman managing partner of a major law firm. She was the first woman hired by a major law firm, her law firm.","[INTERVIEWED2]. My attitude, Matt, is when people get to know her, they'll see why I picked her.","[INTERVIEWED]. They will. In the confirmation hearings alone, they'll see that she what she's like.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I think the Washington Times has a story this morning that said they had about 27 Republican Senators have serious questions about Judge Miers or about Harriet Miers ","[INTERVIEWED2]. No, Judge Miers well spoken.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I was going to say  kind of getting ahead of myself here. So you are convinced that she will be confirmed?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Absolutely. Not only am I convinced that she'll be confirmed; I'm convinced that she'll be a fine, great judge. And I'm convinced that she'll be the kind of she won't change. I mean, the person I know is not the kind of person that is going to change her philosophy. And her philosophy is, is that she is not going to legislate from the bench. So I told the American people when I campaigned for President the type of judge I'll pick. I picked that type of person in John Roberts, and I picked that type of person in Harriet Miers.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Your political guru, Karl Rove, is set to or scheduled to testify before a grand jury for the fourth time this coming week, it seems, looking into the leak of a CIA agent's name. You've said if someone on your staff had anything to do with that leak, you'll take care of that person. Has Karl Rove looked you in the eye, [INTERVIEWED2], and said, \"I, in no way, bent or broke the rules or the law when it comes to this case\"?","[INTERVIEWED2]. Matt, I've also consistently said I'm not going to talk about the case. It's under review, so I'm not going to talk about it. Thank you for asking, but on the other hand, the special prosecutor has made it clear and made it clear  that he doesn't want anybody speculating or talking about the case, so I'm not going to talk about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But does it worry you that they seem to have such an interest in Mr. Rove?","[INTERVIEWED2]. I'm not going to talk about the case. I've been asked this a lot; my answer is consistent. The special prosecutor is conducting a very serious investigation. He's doing it in a very dignified way, by the way, and we'll see what he says.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Got a big date coming up in Iraq this coming week, on the 15th, a vote on the referendum on the constitution there. What do you expecting to happen there? And what are you expecting to happen in the days leading up to that vote?","[INTERVIEWED2]. I expect violence, because there's a group of terrorists and killers who want to try to stop the advance of democracy in Iraq. I also expect people to vote, which is a remarkable achievement. We had a remarkable achievement last January when millions of people voted. They now have a chance to vote on a constitution that will help unify the country. And then they'll have a chance to vote, if the constitution passes, on a permanent government.","And so what you're seeing is the unfolding of a dual-track strategy. On the one hand, democracy is advancing, much to the amazement of a lot of people, particularly people in the region. And on the other hand, we're working to train Iraqi troops so they can provide the security for a democracy to move forward.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I'm going to let you get back to work in a second. I'm just curious about one other subject, and you've spoken about this recently, this whole issue of a possible worldwide pandemic, this avian flu. You know, 60 people have died in Asia so far. They're worried that if this comes here, there are, by some estimates this could claim millions of lives around the world.","After Hurricane Katrina, there are some people in this country who are worried. They're not sure who's in charge, who do I turn to, who's going to handle a major catastrophe in this country? Are you confident that this administration has a plan in place to handle something like that?","[INTERVIEWED2]. I'm confident that we're working to identify the possible outbreak of avian flu, contain it to where the outbreak takes place, and strategize how to deal with it if it ever were to come to the United States.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Who would take the lead in that? Would it be a military situation? Would it be homeland security?","[INTERVIEWED2]. It's a really interesting question, and it's one that I raised that has created a little bit of consternation among some. I have said that there may be a catastrophic event such that the Federal Government has got the it's only the Federal Government that has got the capacity to move in quickly with a lot of resources, which would require law changes. For example, the military cannot become police without a special proclamation.","And so we're planning all this out. We're in the midst of, one, identifying that there may be a problem, and, two, what to do about it. When I have a plan that I'm comfortable with, of course I will talk to the American people about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Your husband has been through an awful lot ","[INTERVIEWED]. Our country has been through an awful lot.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What toll have you seen this take, personally, on him? Not only you know, we had 9/11 in the first term, and now we've got Iraq, and we've got Katrina, and we've got Rita. What toll have you seen this take?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well ","[INTERVIEWED2]. He can barely stand. He's about to drop on the spot.","[INTERVIEWED]. He's doing great. He's got big, broad shoulders. There's a lot, but there's a lot on the American people too, and their response has been so terrific. You know, we can face challenges, and they're tough, and this is very tough down here. The number of people, the huge number of people that are displaced, that have lost everything, but you know, people are rebuilding their lives, and other people want to help them, and that's what I see.","[INTERVIEWED2]. You know, I'm the kind of guy who gets inspired by the decency of others, and as I travel the country and see this incredible spirit, it's so uplifting. It makes me understand how blessed we are to be an American. These folks right here I never met them before, but they're from all over the country. They're here for one reason, to love a neighbor. And that's a remarkable expression. And Laura and I want to thank them, and we want to encourage others around the country to do to follow their lead and follow their example.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, this is going to be the home of the Collins family, and we're going to talk to the Collins family in a little while.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's great.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED1], [INTERVIEWED2], thanks so much for your time this morning.","[INTERVIEWED2]. Thanks, Matt, appreciate it.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks, Matt.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Grab your hammers, and go back to work. "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmattlauernbcstodayshownewyorkcity","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], good morning; nice to have you here.","[INTERVIEWED]. Good morning, Matt. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I don't think I'm betraying any confidence when I say that I checked with the VH1 people and I said, \"How did you get [INTERVIEWED] involved in this campaign?\" And they threw their arms up and they said, \"He kind of volunteered\"","[INTERVIEWED]. That's true.","[INTERVIEWER1]. \"I mean, he's called many times and said, 'What can I do?\"' Why is this so important to you?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, Hillary and I both spent a lot of time on this, and it's important for two reasons. One is, I was in music when I was the age of these children, and I know what it can do. And secondly, I've been very disturbed over the years over the last 20 years, more and more, as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs. You know, the principals have a lot of problems. They have a lot of challenges they have to meet, and many times the money is not there. And the school districts have cut a lot of these music programs out all over the country.","And when I heard what VH1 was doing, I did kind of volunteer to get involved. I wrote John Sykes a letter and said, \"Look, I'm for this, and I think we've got to get music back into these schools.\" A lot of young children we know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education. Not everyone learns in the same way. Not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you say, though I mean, let's say, devil's-advocate it for a second I'm a member of the local school board, and I sit down, and I look at the budget, and it's shrinking. And I say, \"I've got choices. I have to make cuts. I've got school lunches over here. I have books for the library here. I have music education over here.\" How do you stop me from cutting music education?","[INTERVIEWED]. It depends on what your options are. But very often there are some options. And that's what that wonderful movie about music education here in New York City, \"Music of the Heart,\" was about. But what this program tries to do is to encourage the schools to put some money into music education by giving them extra help with instruments and sometimes with other support.","And what we've tried to do at the national level, with the National Endowment for the Arts and the President's Commission on the Arts and Humanities that Hillary's the honorary chair of, is to constantly support music education, to emphasize that the schools that have good music education programs see positive other academic advancements as a result of it, and of course, try to get some more funds for the lower income schools out there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But is the message getting out? I mean, you had music education as a kid; so did I. We took it for granted. We're now in a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, and still today, only 25 percent of schools across this country offer music education as a basic part of the curriculum.","[INTERVIEWED]. See, what a lot of people don't know is, over the last 20 years and particularly in the last decade or so, while our school populations have been growing again, a smaller percentage of property-tax payers have kids in the schools. And an awful lot of our schools are funded primarily through the property tax. So the schools have had all kinds of financial problems. Their energy bills go up. A lot of them have substandard physical facilities. They have the need to hire more teachers to teach various academic requirements that may have come in. And they don't want to stop any of their competitive athletic proposals. So the two things that have suffered most in the schools are the music programs and the art programs, on the one hand, and the physical education programs for people who aren't in competitive team sports.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But is this the way it's going to be? I mean, when people like VH1 come in and they donate money like this, it's great, but it's private and public partnership. Why can't we find a way, even through the Federal Government's assistance, to make sure that this is a basic part of education?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we should do that. But the main thing we have to do is to build broader public support for doing it. Let me say, interestingly enough, you asked me the budget question. That's the first question: Well, what would you do if you had all these tough budget decisions? Our research indicates that the number one factor in whether music education programs stay or come back to schools is strong community involvement pushing for it. In other words, where people at the grassroots want it, the people who make the budget decisions tend to find a way to provide it.","And so, what we can best do, I think, is to point out consistently what the overall educational benefits are, number one, and number two, to try to get more Federal assistance out there to the schools to help deal with their big problems. That's why I'm trying to get the Federal Government to help with school construction and school repair, to help the school districts hire teachers to lower class sizes so they don't have to cut out music to hire that extra teacher when the population goes up, and to get the overall aid to low income schools up. So if we do those things and we get the kind of grassroots support we need, then what VH1 will be doing is supplementing a growing trend, instead of trying to fill a huge hole.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is it possible to take it a step further? From what I understand now, the Federal Government supplies about 9 percent of funding for schools; local and States provide the rest. Can you offer States incentives? Can you say to them, \"Look, we'll provide more funding if you take it upon yourselves to make music education part of your basic curriculum?\"","[INTERVIEWED]. We could do that. I hadn't thought of that, exactly in that way. What we tried to dolet me just say this. What we've tried to do for the last 7 years, since I've been [INTERVIEWED], is to say, \"Look, here are the Nation's education goals. They include music and the arts. And if you come up with a plan to meet those goals, we will give you some help to implement the plan, which included music and the arts.\"","Basically, the specific targeted dollars we have for schools go to schools that have greater financial need, because they've got a higher percentage of low income kids, or to hire more teachers, generally, because the school population is going up.","I think if we will stay with the position that we're going to help all the schools that have these goals, which include music and the arts, and then we come in with the big ticket items, which are personnel and school building and repair, and we can build the kind of grassroots support we need, then these music programs will be able to survive.","But one of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just took the music programs for granted. A lot of people who were making tough budget decisions assumed nobody would care if they were eliminated. And it was tragic, what happened. So I think what's going to happen you'll see a big infusion of public money going back into these programs because of what VH1 has done and because more and more parents will insist on the music being there. And I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We're going to take a little break. When we come back, I understand we're joined by another special guest, and we'll talk more about music education.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And we're back with President Bill Clinton at P.S. 96 in East Harlem. Let me ask for a couple of quick answers to some questions in the news. Los Alamos: Congress is holding hearings on security breaches there. Two hard drives containing nuclear secrets disappeared. Do you think national security was jeopardized?","[INTERVIEWED]. It's not clear, but I think it's very important to get to the bottom of it. The FBI is investigating it, and we've got Senator Baker and Congressman Hamilton, who have agreed to take an independent look. It's a serious issue, and I think what we ought to do is just see the investigation through and see where the facts lead us.","But we need to do what we can to find out what happened, whether there was a security breach, and if so, how we can change it so it will never happen again.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You and I were both watching the news earlier about gas prices.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. People in Chicago, Milwaukee, in particular, paying 40 cents a gallon more than the rest of us.","[INTERVIEWED]. Than anybody else in the country. It's been very frustrating to me. I'm quite concerned about it.","Let me tell you what we know. We know that the prices were affected by the shutdown of a refinery, which is coming back up, a leak in a pipeline, which is the cheapest way to transport gas, and an unusual increase in demand in the Chicago-Milwaukee area. And all that affected it. Also, they used the cleaner gasoline, which is more expensive to produce, but that's only about 5 or 6 cents a gallon. So we know that it would be more expensive for a little while until the transportation and the refinery problems are solved.","What we don't know is whether there was any price gouging. So we've got the Federal Trade Commission looking into that, and we've also had the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency looking into it. I'm very worried about it. But I'm hoping that we can break the logjam on it soon.","[INTERVIEWER1] introduced musician Billy Joel, who offered his advice to the young musicians present.]","[INTERVIEWED]. The only thing I would say is, don't get discouraged early. If you'll stay with it long enough, until you like to hear yourself play, then it will be easier for you to keep practicing. But if you play one of these reed instruments, you'll squeak a lot. If you play a string instrument, it'll hurt your ears in the beginning. Just stay with it; be patient. And when you reach the point where you like to hear yourself play, then it's all downhill from there. You just keep working.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Maybe it's a good time for you to relate to them also. You had a music teacher in your early life who had a pretty strong impact on your life.","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, absolutely I did. I had a well, my high school band director, Virgil Spurlin, is still a friend of mine, still writes me to this day. My grade school band director was a man named George Grey, who had a big impact on me. My vocal my choir teacher when I was in elementary school, I still remember vividly. Her name was Lillian Rutherford. All the kids I knew had access to choir and could be in the band if they wanted to. And I'm so glad that John Sykes and VH1 and all these people are trying to make it possible for you to do this, because it's something you don't have to I was not as good as Billy Joel, see, so I didn't get to be a professional musician. But I had a wonderful time. It changed my life for the better. And it still benefits me, and I still play.","[INTERVIEWER1].  you have to be thinking a lot about legacy. And you look at young people in the third and fourth grade how do you want them to be a part of your legacy?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I want them to have more opportunity, more educational opportunity, than they had when I became [INTERVIEWED]. And I want them to grow up in a country that is a more just and decent country, where there is less discrimination and where people work together more. And I think that that will be the case. But it's really important that kids are not deprived of opportunities like music, just because of where they happen to live and whether their parents have money or not. That shouldn't be what determines this.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Just a suggestion: You've got some free time coming up in January, and Billy, you've got a little free time. I'm thinking, you go to the garage in Chappaqua; you get a little amplifier like you used to do in high school aggravate the neighbors, and put together a little band here.","[INTERVIEWED]. I accept.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you so much for coming in. Billy Joel, it's always good to see you. [INTERVIEWED], nice to see you, as well.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmaureenbunyanabc7","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], to most Americans, Iran is still part of the axis of evil, its holding American hostages, and it helps to undermine the middle eastern-middle eastern affairs. Why should Americans stomach, and how can Americans stomach a deal with a country like that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Because we don't want them to get nuclear weapons. It's precisely because Iran has been so antagonistic to us, to friends of ours like Israel, that we have to make sure that they don't get a nuclear weapon. That's been something that has been a top priority of my administration, but also previous Democratic and Republican administrations. That's why we set up 5 years of the toughest sanctions ever imposed on Iran which forced them to negotiate. And that's why we have now put forward a deal in concert with allies like, Great Britain, and Germany, and France and others, that ensures that all the major pathways for them getting nuclear weapons are shut off. And not only are we achieving a central national security goal of ours, but we're doing it without initiating another military action in the middle east at a time when obviously the middle east is in pretty bad shape. That doesn't mean that we trust Iran, it means that we've set up such a vigorous system to inspect and verify that they're not getting a nuclear weapon, making them shut down facilities that would give us cause for concern, that we and most nuclear experts are able to see into what they're doing and ensure that we're not seeing nuclear proliferation in one of the most volatile parts of the world.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned Israel, our staunchest ally in the middle east, completely, adamantly opposed to this agreement. What are you doing to—to allow that—not to allow our relationship with Israel to deteriorate even further?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well keep in mind that our relationship militarily in terms of intelligence cooperation with Israel has never been stronger. There is a policy disagreement between this administration and everyone else in the world, and prime minister Netanyahu of Israel. And while I respect his legitimate concerns about Iran, as I've said very clearly, he's wrong on this issue. We don't want to have Iran get a nuclear weapon and every credible expert who's looked at this says \"this is the best path for us not to get a nuclear weapon.\" What we do have to continue to do though is recognize that even with Iran not having a nuclear weapon, that they are still engaging activities that are adverse to our interests and our values. And we have to work with not just Israel, but other partners in the region to make sure that Iran's not sending shipments to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, to make sure that they are not destabilizing","countries that are very important to us. And that is something that we are already doing and will continue to be committed to doing in the years ahead.","[INTERVIEWER1]. In the years when you were promoting the Affordable Care Act, you had a lot of allies in Congress who were standing at your side and doing some of the heavy lifting for you. In the case of this Iran deal, it seems as if you are not getting that kind of support from Congress, and you're having to do a lot of it yourself, a little arm twisting here and there we understand.","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, the truth is that this is probably going to be challenging but not as challenging as getting the Affordable Care Act done. I mean we've got terrific Senators, like Tim Kaine in Virginia, who have stood up and made a very clear case as to why this is important to do. And I am very confident that this deal will go forward. It's unfortunate that we had republicans who immediately, uniformly opposed the deal, before the deal was even signed and before they had even read it. But you know one of the things that I've noticed is there was an initial interim deal that we did with Iran during the course of the talks, that the same folks expressed skepticism towards, two years later because it actually shut down any expansion of Iran's nuclear program and worked exactly the way it was designed, suddenly they now all think it was a good deal. So you know the politics of these things today are going to be very different than the politics a year or two years from now when people see that we've been able to shut off Iran's nuclear program from advancing in a way that could pose a threat to us.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much sir.","[INTERVIEWED]. It was great to talk to you, thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. My pleasure."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmayarhodantime","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]: Well thank you both so much for joining us today. My hope is that this is more of a conversation than an interview. So we'll just let you guys talk. I'm going to be obviously jumping in with questions. But we want it to be natural and fun. And I want to start off by saying that you guys have a lot more in common than I'm sure a lot of people know. You're both born into multiracial families, you were raised by single mothers. And you've risen to the top of your respective fields as African Americans. Which is pretty notable. But I'm curious, what do you see in each other that you recognize in yourself? Like what is it, and is there a common thread that has allowed you both to succeed?","[INTERVIEWED1]. Well first of all, I thought you were going to say that I'm also a really good dancer.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I thought about it. I saw you dancing with a 106-year-old.","[INTERVIEWED2]: That's not the common thread.","[INTERVIEWED1]: So I was a little let down as you, that wasn't the common thread that she picked up on. Well first of all, I mean I couldn't be prouder of what Misty's done","You know, as the father of two daughters, one of the things I'm always looking for are strong women who are out there who are breaking barriers and doing great stuff. And Misty's a great example of that. Somebody who has entered a field that's very competitive, where the assumptions are that she may not belong. And through sheer force of will and determination and incredible talent and hard work she was able to arrive at the pinnacle of her field. And that's exciting. The other thing is, as a father of two daughters, seeing how images of strong athletic accomplished women carry over, and encouraging them in sports and dance and how they move physically, it turns out that every study shows that young girls who are involved in sports, dance, athletics end up having more confidence generally. And across the board in everything that they do end up being more assertive, happier. So this is one of the reasons why having Misty on our Fitness Council has been so important.","[INTERVIEWED2]: I think that there is a sense of humbleness and humility, and there's a human that's within you. And I think that that's something that I can relate to and connect with that people are drawn to. And they feel this genuineness coming from you. And I think that it allows you to rise to this level, and not feel this pressure that's kind of pushing you down, but allows you to take the responsibility with a sense of pride. And again just being grounded. And I feel like as I'm embarking on my first season as a principal dancer I'm experiencing something that I didn't prepare myself for, I think emotionally and mentally and psychologically. When you have all of these expectations and goals to reach this point that 1% get to, you know how do you ? what do you do when you get there?","How do you stay grounded and humble and striving? And I think that's on a much smaller scale for me, but something that I feel I can relate to with you that I can't imagine you must have experienced.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Well, you know, it's interesting, this whole notion of when you arrive. I don't know how it felt for you, but certainly for me, you know probably I burst out onto the national scene with the Democratic Convention speech of 2004. And that was the first time that I had a big national audience. And everybody responded really favorably. And so I got a lot of attention and interviews and magazine pieces and all this stuff. And I still remember telling Michelle and my closest friends, I said I'm not any smarter today than I was last week, right. In some ways, when you struggle for a while, and you've had the ability of being an ordinary person and you've gone shopping, changed diapers and tried to figure out how to pay the bills and so forth, so that you're not some overnight success. Then handling some of these issues ends up being easier because you have a better sense of perspective. You don't sense somehow that this is because I'm just so special, or because I'm so much smarter than that other person. Because in fact you've known those other people who are talented and smart and capable. In some ways you got a break, you were lucky. And that, for me at least keeps me grounded because it reminds me that, you know, for all the blessings and privileges and responsibilities that I've gotten, I'm just representing a huge cross section of people who are talented and capable and supported me getting to where I came from. So that takes a little bit of the edge off. And more importantly, it means that your friends don't start looking at you and thinking oh, you're acting kind of like you're all that, right. And it's good to have friends who will do that for you. If you start acting weird, they're like --","[INTERVIEWED2]: Check you.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Yeah. It's like what, suddenly you're some prima ballerina? Please. I remember when ? and they'll remind you of some story. Okay. That's helpful.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And you both represent the African American community. As [INTERVIEWED1] of the United States, as a principal dancer for the American Ballet Theater, do you ever think that ? how does race come to play? Do you think that people still treat you differently because of race? Because you're African American?","[INTERVIEWED2]: You know, my experience has been that a lot of what I've experienced has not always been to my face, or it's been very subtle. But it's in a way that I know what's going on and I feel it deep inside of me. And I, being the only African American in almost every environment in terms of classical ballet, it weighs on you and it wears on you after a while. And I feel like a lot of it as well is what I'm kind of putting on myself. And this just trying to not get too caught up and too wrapped up and too weighed down with being black and trying to just be the best person and the best dancer that I can be. And work, and work harder than, even if I see the person next to me that things may be a little bit easier for them, I'm going to try and push myself even harder than them. But I think that being African American has definitely been a huge obstacle for me. But it's also allowed me to have this fire inside of me that I don't know if I would have or have had if I weren't in this field.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Well part of classical ballet that makes it challenging is that there's a very set way of doing things. There's sort of this canon that people want it just a certain way, or they want it to look a certain way. So do you find now that you're in a position where you can start pushing the barriers a little bit and the boundaries in terms of what people expect? Now that you've established that alright, I can do this, so let me also do that. Or I can master that style, and so now can we introduce something a little bit different? How much of that takes place?","[INTERVIEWED2]: Absolutely. I mean I think that having a platform and having a voice to be seen by people beyond the classical ballet world has really been my power I feel. It's allowed me to say, it's okay to have a healthy athletic body. We are fully capable of doing everything that the person who doesn't have an extremely athletic body, that is more thin. We're fully capable of doing exactly the same thing. And I think that being in this position and showing that I can execute and do all of these things that it's possible to have any skin complexion, to have a healthy body image for the ballerina body. I think it's given me more of a voice. And it's I think forcing a lot of these top tier companies to address the lack of diversity and diversifying the bodies that we're seeing in classical ballet. It's really forcing that conversation to be had.","[INTERVIEWED1]: I have to say as an outside, I don't know if you feel the same way. When I hear that like your body type is considered sort of more athletic or large, you're tiny. For those of you who are watching, you may not be able to see. I mean, you're petite.","[INTERVIEWED2]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWED1]: So the notion that somehow that was even a question is pretty interesting.","[INTERVIEWED2]: Yeah, I mean I think it's how ? I think it's a lot of the language and how we use it. And I think for a lot of people of color, that seems to be an easy way or a way out by saying you don't fit in. It may be it's your skin color. It may be the texture of your hair. Whatever it is.","[INTERVIEWED1]: We want a certain look.","[INTERVIEWED2]: Yeah. And I think that's an easy way of addressing that.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Interesting.","[INTERVIEWER1]: As a father of two daughters, do you see that at all? Do you see that pressure in your own life?","[INTERVIEWED1]: Yeah. I mean some of this is just gender issues, generally. I mean when you're a dad of two daughters you notice more. When I was a kid I didn't realize as much, or maybe it was even a part of which is the enormous pressure that young women are placed under in terms of looking a certain way. And being cute in a certain way. And are you wearing the right clothes? And is your hair done the right way. And that pressure I think is historically always been harder on African American women than just about any other women. But it's part and parcel of a broader way in which we socialize and press women to constantly doubt themselves or define themselves in terms of a certain appearance. And so Michelle and I are always guarding against that. And the fact that they've got a tall gorgeous mom who has some curves, and that their father appreciates, I think is helpful. I do think that culture's changing for the younger generation a little bit more. You see Beyonce or you see some of these pop stars and what both white, Latino, black children are seeing as representative of beauty is much broader than it was when I was a kid. You just didn't see that much representation. And that's healthy and that's encouraging. But it's still a challenge. I mean Malia will talk about black girl's hair and will have much opinions of that. And she's pretty opinionated about the fact that it costs a lot, it takes a long time, that sometimes girls can be just as tough on each other about how they're supposed to look. And so it's, as a parent, that's a constant learning process that you're trying to hold the fort. And that's why somebody like Misty ends up being so important.","A lot of it is the power of that image, even if they're not dancers, even if they're not interested in pursuing a career in entertainment or the arts. For them to know that that's valued end up making a big difference.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And beyond the just simply being there, that obviously makes a difference. But then there's also a pressure like you mentioned to do more. And I'm curious also what you make of social movements like Black Girl Magic, when there's like these grassroots level reinforcement of these ideas that black is beautiful, in a sense?","[INTERVIEWED2]: It's so important for this generation. And to use social media to have a positive impact on our generation is huge. And I know that you have a presence as well. And it's such a part ? I think we have to be involved I think in order to really reach the younger generation on social media. But to have movements like Black Girl Magic, I think it couldn't be more positive for a young black girl to see that it's okay to be yourself, it's okay to not have to transform and look like what you may see on the cover of a lot of magazines. That you are beautiful, that it's possible to succeed in any field that you want to, looking the way that you do. With your hair the way it is. I think all of that is so extremely important and something that I'm constantly celebrating. That something that I fought so hard for throughout the beginning of my career is I didn't want to pancake my skin a lighter color to fit into the ... ballet. I wanted to be myself. I didn't want to have to wear makeup that made my nose look thinner. There are just ? it's important I think with this generation of young minorities, children especially, to feel comfortable and confident in their skin.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Well social media obviously is the way in which young people are receiving information in general. So the power of young activists to help shape color and politics through things like Black Lives Matter, which I think is hugely important. And when I think about the journey I've traveled, there's no doubt that young African America, Latino, Asian, LGBT youth, they have more role models. They have more folks that they can immediately identify with.","And that, in and of itself is of value. But what we also have to remember is that the barriers that exist for them to pursue their dreams are deep and structural. And so it is wonderful that the potential dancer can see Misty and say, I can do that. But if there's no dance studio at all in their neighborhood, and if their schools don't offer any extracurricular activities at all, or if their school is chronically underfunded, then it's going to be a problem.","I hope that there are young men of color who are looking at me and saying, I can aspire to be [INTERVIEWED1], or a senator, or a community organizer and make change in my neighborhoods. But if they are locked out of opportunity, and in neighborhoods where even if I'm on television, there are no men in their neighborhoods who've got jobs that are able to support a family, then you've still got problems.","So I think culture, changing attitudes is hugely important. You know we're for example trying to get more girls and women to study the stem subjects, math, science, engineering. Because they're chronically under-represented. And in researching this we found out that for example, since CSI came on, and there are women who are doing forensic investigations, that the number of women who are in this field has skyrocketed, right. So some of it is just okay, I now picture myself as doing that. But I think it's important for us to remember that it's not just a matter of providing us a strong image, it's also making sure that they've got good schools, making sure that they're getting programs that allow them to explore all their talents. Making sure that the economy is working in a way that gives everybody a chance to succeed. It's a both and rather than an either or proposition.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Well how do you make sure those things are protected when you see, for example Affirmative Action in the balance again? Is that something that's important in academics and the arts for example?","[INTERVIEWED1]: Well I ? look, I'm a strong supporter of Affirmative Action as a way of opening more doors. And I think there are ways of structuring Affirmative Action so that everybody's getting more of a chance. And the truth of the matter is, there's always been Affirmative Action, it just hasn't always been minority focused, right.","If you make a big donation to a university, your kid is more likely to get into the university. It's not called Affirmative Action, it's called legacies. And so for a school, for a dance program, for a political organization to say we're going to actively seek out and recruit talent that hasn't had insight into this field before, this world before. We're going to have a bunch of young girls come into American Ballet Theater and just watch, and get a workshop, and have them imagine themselves on that stage. You know, because they're much less likely to have a program available to them in their community or to have parents who even know about ballet. Well, that's something that's extraordinarily valuable. And I think we can sustain, while not being so rigid that it ends up locking anybody else out of an opportunity.","[INTERVIEWED2]: I absolutely agree. I mean I think it's so completely necessary. Especially when you're dealing with a field that's never really been open to reaching out to communities that don't have the access, that don't have the exposure and the means to be a part of something especially that's so niche as the classical ballet world. And I think that it's a responsibility that I feel. You know, being the only African American at this level in American Ballet Theater, I feel like people are looking at me, and it's my responsibility for me to do whatever I can to provide these opportunities in communities to be able to educate them.","And if that means having a program just for black dancers to allow them to have the same opportunity that generations and generations of white dancers have had, it's necessary.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I've got something called My Brother's Keeper that we've been mobilizing all across the country. And the notion is, if we can reach young men of color, who so often are channeled into destructive behavior or into dropping out of school and ending up in the prison pipeline. If we can just expose them to what their possibilities are, link them with a mentor, work with the institutions like schools to say, examine what your policies are on suspensions and expulsions to make sure that black boys or Hispanic boys aren't being treated differently. What you do is to ? what you discover through this process is how much talent is there untapped. And we bring in some mentees to the White House each year. And I have lunch with them and we pair them up with senior advisors. And a lot of them have never even been into an office setting before. A lot of them don't know what it means to be a secret service agent. Or what would be required for them to pursue a professional degree. And we've been doing this for a few years now, and we're already seeing how the horizons that these young men suddenly have for themselves starts rising. And the great thing is we've been able to duplicate this in hundreds of cities across the country. You're seeing companies step up saying we're willing to bring in somebody for the summer so that they can get exposed to what a law firm looks like, or what an accounting firm looks like. And that then provides the motivation for these young people to navigate and take ? make better choices in their own lives. Because ultimately, I'm sure Misty feels this, I certainly feel it, we wouldn't have succeeded if we hadn't worked hard. You can't replace hard work and initiative and discipline and sacrifice, and delayed gratification. There are all kinds of things you give up along whatever path to success you've chosen. But part of what inspires you to make those sacrifices is the sense that I might actually succeed, you know. And so much of what we want to do with our young people is persuade them to dream big, and to not feel that somehow their circumstances at birth, or the circumstances of their upbringing or poverty or race in any way inhibits them. You have to be honest with them and say yeah, it's going to be harder for you than it might have been for somebody else. But that's okay. It turns out that kids are extraordinarily resilient if they feel like they can actually make something happen.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Looking back, was there anything that someone told either of you about race, or didn't tell you about race that you wish they had or that you feel like you had to learn on your own? And how does that impact how you talk to young people today?","[INTERVIEWED2]: I feel like my mom pretty much covered everything with me. Being biracial she made it very clear to me that yes, you're Italian and you're German and you are black, but you are going to be viewed by the world and by society as a black woman and you should be prepared for that. I think that I, being very shy going into a setting where I was the only black woman, allowed me to observe more, rather than react. And I think that saved me a lot. And it taught me a lot. And it has allowed me to, when I'm interacting with my mentees to say to them, you know, there are just ways that you have to approach situations that may be difficult or may not be fair, but it's how you represent yourself. You may be carrying a responsibility that you don't want, but it is what it is being African American and being in certain environments. It doesn't matter if you're a ballet dancer, if you're an attorney, whatever it is you're trying to do, you're going to be faced with these obstacles.","[INTERVIEWED1]: You know, I mean I think about this now as a parent. Michelle and I are having a lot of conversations around the dinner table. And for me, what I always try to transmit to my kids is that issues of race, discrimination, tragic history of slavery and Jim Crow, all those things are real. And you have to understand them and you have to be knowledgeable about them. And recognize that they didn't stop overnight. Certainly not just when I was elected. I remember people talking about how somehow this was going to solve all our racial problems. I wasn't one of those who subscribed to that notion. And, but what I want them to draw from it is a sense of justice for everybody. My view is that the strength of having been a minority on the receiving end of discrimination is that it should make you that much more attuned and empathetic towards anybody who's vulnerable. Towards anybody who's being locked out. So what I say to my kids is use this as something that provides you a particular power to be willing to fight on behalf of what you think is right. And that includes thinking about and being concerned with the struggles that whites have in this society as well. You know part of what I think is sometimes difficult, but I think absolutely necessary for black activists like those who are engaging in some of the protests around Ferguson etc., is to try to also get yourself in the mindset of a police officer who is scared.","And who is trying to figure out how to navigate a really challenging job and wants to get home safe. And may make a split second decision. And how are they being trained? And are they being provided enough guidance from their bosses that will steer them in a better direction than the worst direction? That's hard to do because it's easier to just kind of say, be angry and frustrated. And part of what I think successful social movements have involved is having a certain righteous anger about injustices being done to you, but also understanding that people who are on the other side of this, they've got their own history and their own circumstances. And you have to understand that, and you have to recognize that each of us has some good and some bad in is. And that's not an excuse, but what it does do is it gives us an opportunity then to have a conversation and to reach across the divide. And that's not something that always, at a time when so much of communications is sound-bytes and tweets, cable news, it's hard to have that kind of conversation. It's easier I think to just make everything very black and white. But I think that when you look at how social changes happened throughout history, including in our country, it's been because we can project ourselves into the circumstances of other people.","And hopefully that's something that Malia and Sasha and her generation is picking up on. And I think they have.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And wrapping things up. What do you see as the single greatest fixable obstacle to the success of young people today?","[INTERVIEWED2]: The single, wow. I think ? I mean everything that you were saying, being able to have an understanding of yourself and how you fit into society and who you are. But to be empathetic to everyone around you I think is such a powerful thing to hold. To be able to forgive. All of those things I think can strengthen this generation of our youth. I think having a strong sense of self and just knowing who they are and being comfortable with that.","[INTERVIEWED1]: Well, you know, I spend most of my time thinking about institutions. And there's no doubt, even though it's a clich? that the single biggest difference we can make is making sure that our kids get a good education. We can do a lot to keep the economy moving forward, we can do a lot to make sure that we're enforcing our nondiscrimination laws. We can do a lot more to open up people's perspective about who belongs where. And press to make sure that we have more women CEOs, and more African American film directors. And more Latino police officers. And all those things are important. But the foundation that all this depends is making sure that on the front end, when these little babies are born and start to get curious about the world and are like sponges, that we are giving them the kind of education and the nurturing that they need. So that they're off to a good start. And that involves an imaginative leap, a moral leap on the part of the society as a whole that says every kid should get a genuine opportunity and we're willing to put money behind it, and we're willing to invest in that to break cycles of poverty. And to reach out and pull kids up, even if they aren't born into the best of circumstances. And that's hard to do. Because we're working off of a legacy of hundreds of years of discrimination that gets passed on generationally. If we could decide tomorrow that there was no discrimination, that we had some new drug that everybody took and suddenly nobody would be racially prejudiced. We still have a whole bunch of really poor kids who need help. And that still requires us making investments in them. And that means that all of us, the government, private sector, nonprofits, have to make some sacrifices so that those kids are getting an opportunity.","And if you talk to the average person, they embrace that idea. One of the great things about being president is you get to meet people from all walks of life.","And ... people are fundamentally good people. And they want to do the right thing. And if you ask them should every child have an opportunity, they will tell you yes. But, if you tell them okay, that may mean we've got to spend more tax dollars to provide them with better schools. And the teachers have to be paid more. And we have to make sure that they've got computer equipment in their schools, and arts and music programs aren't a luxury, they're something that helps that child thrive. Then people start saying well, you know, I've got my own bills to pay. And I moved into this good school district and I want to make sure that that school district maintains its advantages. And I'm not sure whether the money's going to be well spent. We find all kinds of excuses why we don't actually do it, move that agenda forward. And part of my goal, through things like My Brother's Keeper, part of Michelle's goal to ? an initiative she's got called Let Girls Learn, is to keep on creating more and more avenues where we as a society can have that conversation and actually move forward and do the right thing. If we do that, we're not going to eliminate racism and prejudice entirely in this society. But what we can do is to greatly lessen how much it determines the life chances of people. And that should be our goal.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Great. Well thank you both so much for chatting with us. This has been really great. And lastly, did you guys catch the game on Saturday? Is Steph Curry the greatest, or is he just great?","[INTERVIEWED1]: Steph Curry is the greatest shooter that I've ever seen. You knew I had an opinion on this. And, and I am having more fun watching him than anybody since Michael Jordan.","[INTERVIEWER1]: I was going to ask, is he better than Jordan? He's pretty remarkable.","[INTERVIEWED1]: He's not ? even Steph wouldn't necessarily say he's better than Jordan. But he's ? the fact that he's about my size and he's doing what he's doing.","[INTERVIEWED2]: And I think the growth has been tremendous, I can imagine where he's going to go.","[INTERVIEWED1]: It is, that's a great point. It's rare where you get somebody who's already at the pinnacle and then they take it another notch higher. And he's a wonderful young man. He's a lot of run.","[INTERVIEWER1]: Well thank you.","[INTERVIEWED1]: It's great to see you. Thank you, I enjoyed it."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmeganglaroscbssthismorning","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]: The big news story of the day today and obviously President Jonathan accepting US aid to help the girls in Nigeria. So what help will we provide? And do you think at this point with three weeks in, is it too late?","[INTERVIEWED]: We're sending in a team made up of our military and law enforcement and other experts, and we're very glad that Nigeria has accepted the help. Obviously what's happening is awful. And as a father of two girls, I can't imagine what the parents are going through.","But this organization, Boko Haram, has been one of the worst regional or local terrorist organizations in the world. We'd long sought to work with Nigeria on dealing with them. And we're going to do everything we can to assist them in recovering these young women.","More broadly though we're gonna have to really tackle a pernicious problem inside that county—a an organization that's carried out ruthless attacks and killed thousands of people over the last several years.","[INTERVIEWER1]: [INTERVIEWED], Climate, climate change in general can be such a partisan issue. There is now bipartisan support for the Keystone Pipeline. They're claiming energy efficiency. In light of all the data coming in with this new report, talking about carbon emissions, are you more onboard or are you concerned at this point?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, the climate assessment plan was done over the course of four years, talking to hundreds of experts across the country, the private sector, not-for profits. And, the assessment is clear. Not only is climate change a problem in the future. It's already affecting Americans. It's increasing the likelihood of floods. Increasing the likelihood of drought. It's increasing the likelihood of storms and hurricanes. It's having an impact on our agriculture. It's having an impact on our tourism industries. And people's lives are at risk.","So, the emphasis on the Climate Action Plan that I've put forward as well as this assessment is there are things we can do about it, but it's only going to happen if the American people and people around the world take the challenge seriously. And, we've already increased our production of solar and wind power. We've already increased fuel efficiency standards on cars, and now we're going to appliances. But we're gonna have to do more. And that should be a bipartisan issue, because always want to make sure that we're passing on an American to our kids and grandkids that is as beautiful as the one that we inherited.","[INTERVIEWER1]: And Sir, climate change is the kind of thing a lot of people don't put as a top priority. How do you change that?","[INTERVIEWED]: Hopefully, by publicizing the fact that there are real costs, not out in the distant future, but right now. We can't attribute any single weather event to climate change. But we know that if temperatures are rising, you're going to see more extreme weather events. And that means that more people are at risk. More homes are lost. More lives are potentially lost. It's going to impact people in severe, significant ways that cost money. And so for us to make some decisions now uh as opposed to putting this off, may seem as though we are dealing with something that we don't have to deal with until later. But in fact we'll end up saving money and lives over the long term. And I think that's something that most Americans understand."," "]}

The Orioles lead the Kansas City Royals 3-2. It is opening day, and [INTERVIEWED] was here today to throw out the first ball, and he'll be joining us momentarily, as soon as we get him miked up.","Well, we've got two right-handers, myself and Jim Palmer, and two left-handers in the booth now, Flanagan and [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWER1]. We finally have some balance up here.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can we get a [INTERVIEWED] chair in here? Thank you very much.","How are you, sir?","[INTERVIEWED]. Great. It's been a good game, don't you think?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I agree.","[INTERVIEWED]. And a beautiful day.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What was that first pitch you threw? Fastball, slider, curve?","[INTERVIEWED]. It wasn't fast. It wasn't fast, but I had a good time.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This is a good time of the year for you. I know you're a big college basketball fan, having gone to Arkansas. Unfortunately, the Razorbacks were eliminated, didn't make it to the finals.","[INTERVIEWED]. But I'm very proud of them. They started 4 freshmen and made it to the Sweet 16, so I think they did well. It was a great tournament this year, I think. Everybody who watched the games must have felt it was a great tournament.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know you love being here on opening day.","[INTERVIEWED]. I do. And this has been exciting, you know? It's great to see this new Baltimore team. You know, they've got a chance to go all the way. And yet, if my count's right, all their RBI's go to Mr. Ripken today.","[INTERVIEWER1]. That's right. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, he got 30 percent of what he had in all spring training. And of course, they all want to get to the White House, because I know you had the Atlanta Braves there in early March.","[INTERVIEWED]. I did.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know you get out to a game or two during the season. Do you watch at the White House when you're home?","[INTERVIEWED]. I do [INTERVIEWER1]uite often, I do. I watch the games when they're on, especially at night. When I come home late at night and I'm kind of keyed up and I don't want to go to sleep, I often watch the games that are on.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A drive to right center field. Johnny Damon makes the catch on the warning track.","[INTERVIEWED]. Great play. That's a great play.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Johnny Damon taking an extra base hit away from Chris Hoiles.","So you were saying you watch our games late at night. I guess in essence what you're saying is that we put you to sleep.","[INTERVIEWED]. Or keep me awake. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. This is the youngster that last year, at Double A, got about 188 at bats, but the reason Bob Boone left him in center field, even though they have a very good center fielder in Tom Goodwin, is because of his ability to make plays like that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Here's Tony Tarasco, who struck out his first time up.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did you play baseball yourself in high school?","[INTERVIEWED]. My school didn't have a team, but we had church league and Boys Club. We had all those. I played in some of those teams when I was a kid. I loved it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know you love to golf; did you play any other sports growing up?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but only not in school; I played church league basketball, softball, baseball, but you know, everybody that grew up where I did wound up loving sports.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Now, are you allowed to have a favorite team?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think so. In the basketball years in the basketball season, excuse me, people understand it when I cheer for my home State team or for my alma mater, Georgetown. And when I was a kid, interestingly enough, in Arkansas, the St. Louis Cardinals were the closest baseball team to us; there were no Texas teams then. And so we used to listen to Cardinals baseball. That's what I studied to when I was a boy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that right?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know you were out here last year when Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive game streak.","[INTERVIEWED]. I was.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What did that mean to you?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it meant a lot to me not only as a baseball fan but as a citizen and as [INTERVIEWED] now, as someone who really wants his country to work well. The idea that a man could show that kind of discipline and devotion to his work and stay with one team for a career in a time and age when a lot of people don't last very long because they don't have the discipline to do it and just go for the big-time bucks in the short run and float around from team to team, or in the case of non-athletes from company to company, I think it really sort of was reassuring, not only to me but to the American people, to see that kind of record set and to see that kind of discipline and loyalty. I liked it a lot.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you aware that Ken Griffey, Jr., is a Presidential candidate and has promised, if elected, to let people not pay taxes for 2 months?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'm worried about that. I'm worried about him. I figure that—at the very least he's going to take more votes away from me than Senator Dole. [Laughter] I'm really worried about it. I think—you know, I've always been a big fan of his. I feel sort of stabbed by it. It's breaking my heart.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You wouldn't consider that, would you?","[INTERVIEWED]. What?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Not having taxes for 2 months?","[INTERVIEWED]. What I want to know is how he's going to pay the bills. I'll consider it. I want to hear the rest of the deal. How is he going to not pay the bills?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Base hit for Jeffrey Hammonds, who is two for two a double his first time up and now a single. So that's a good sign. Hammonds is back healthy and swinging the bat well.","[INTERVIEWED]. Looking good.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Getting back to Cal Ripken and all of the pressure that he must have been under last year during that streak and you can certainly identify with pressure in your office what do you see about the way he handled the pressure?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think he did what I try to do; he didn't vary his routine. He just focused on the day that was before him. And I think that he must have had the record in mind, but it didn't paralyze his play. Even the night he was here, the night he broke the record, he hit a home run on a 0-3 pitch. So he still had enough presence of mind not to even just take the walk, you know? He was there, ready. He was playing. He was alive to every moment, and I think that's what you have to do. When you're under a lot of pressure, you have to just take a deep breath and do what you know to do.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Pitch is low to Brady Anderson, who has struck out and grounded out. We're visiting with [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. I think you've got to give a lot of credit to conditioning, too. And the way he keeps himself in shape in the off-season and during the season must have an incredible amount to do with the fact that he was able to play relatively injury-free all these years. And that re[INTERVIEWER1]uires a lot of discipline.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And you know, a lot of discipline Mike and I played for the Orioles for a number of years, and a lot of people wonder what it's like to play in the big league. Are you enjoying being President? Is it what you thought it was going to be?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Oh, yes, I enjoy it very much. I'm honored every day when I go to work. There are some parts of it that are a little rougher than I thought it would be, but I have no complaints. I signed on for the whole show, and I'm just honored to have a chance to do it, to make a difference, to stand up for what I believe in, and to serve. It's an incredible opportunity, and if I had it to do over again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.","[INTERVIEWER1]. There are no off days as [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. But I always tell everybody","[INTERVIEWER1]. Even Cal gets one off in the spring.","[INTERVIEWED]. even the bad days are good, you know? Even the bad days are good. You know, the only frustrating thing is when you come up against a problem that you know cries out for some sort of resolution, and you're not sure you have the power to do anything about it; or when you get a problem where it seems 50-50 on both sides, you just have to kind of feel your way through to the answer, but you're not neither you nor anyone else can be sure about whether it will come out all right. Those things are frustrating, but in terms of the pressure and the tension of the job, I don't mind that at all. I like it. It's part of the challenge.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Three and 0, the count to Brady Anderson. Jeffrey Hammonds is at first with two outs.","[INTERVIEWED]. Come on, Brady, you need a hit.","[INTERVIEWER1]. There goes Hammonds, throw to second by MacFarlane. He bounces it.","[INTERVIEWED]. He made it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But it gets him anyway.","[INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You don't think so, [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think so.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, maybe we can get the umpire to change his mind.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Could we appeal?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, no. I went to see the umpires before the game. Let's look again.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did they have their glasses on?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yeah, they got him.","[INTERVIEWER1]. They did.","[INTERVIEWED]. They got him. He was right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We'll be back, [INTERVIEWED], in a moment. Take a commercial break; we'll be right back.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Welcome back to Camden Yards. Mel Proctor with Jim Palmer, Mike Flanagan. We're visiting with [INTERVIEWED] of the United States, [INTERVIEWED], who is enjoying opening day here at the ball park.","Good to have you with us.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. It's really beautiful here, isn't it? Fabulous park.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We think it's the best.","[INTERVIEWED]. One nice thing is, look how hard the wind is blowing, and you see the flags up there, and yet it's kind of calm in here, so it doesn't seem to be distracting the game.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Joe Vidiella will lead off the fifth inning for the Royals, with the Orioles ahead 3 to 2. Vidiella was called out on strikes his first time up.","We were talking about your job and the enjoyment you derive from it, but what is the biggest challenge you have faced so far since you have been in office?","[INTERVIEWED]. The initial challenge was to try to get the economy turned around and get the deficit down, get the interest rates down, get the jobs coming back into the economy. Now the big frustration is how to make how to get that economic benefit of we have over 8 million new jobs in the economy. Unemployment is low, lower than the last 25-year average. But there's still a lot of people that feel uncertain, because things are changing so fast. And now the biggest challenge is figuring out how to keep the job machine going and still give the baseball fans in America, the working people, the security that they deserve while they are on the job, some certainty that if they work harder they can get a raise, they can have a retirement, they can provide health care for their kids, that kind of thing.","And no one knows how to do this. It's a new challenge. We have never had a time before when we generated so many new jobs, and the economy was performing well, but we still have people uncertain out there. So that's our biggest challenge today.","[INTERVIEWER1]. One out, Mike MacFarlane up for the Royals. He doubled and scored his first time up.","We were talking about somewhat of a background in sports as a youngster. Did you take any lessons away from competition that you use now in your life and on the job?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. Two, particularly. No matter how good you are at what you're doing, most things work out better when teams do it together. People work better together than they do on their own most of the time. And the second lesson is the obvious one: Never give up. It's not over till it's over.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Were you very frustrated as a sports fan during the baseball strike?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, very. Especially that year. It's something that you can identify with as a pitcher. It was the greatest hitting year in 50 years. I mean, for people like me that grew up memorizing the baseball statistics, not just of all of my heroes in the fifties when I was a boy but going back to the twenties and thirties, I knew the hitting records of all the old players. The idea that we were going to have a literally a 50-year record in hitting. And I know there are all kind of reasons for it, the expansion teams. I know all that. But to see that just thrown away, it just broke my heart. For all of us nuts, it was a bad deal.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thanks for being with us, sir. It's been a pleasure.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Come back anytime.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. This, however, is going to be a good year.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah, I imagine, and a busy year.","[INTERVIEWED]. A good year for baseball.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And also a busy year for you.","[INTERVIEWED]. But I'll still keep up.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Okay. Good luck. Nice seeing you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A real pleasure.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We'll be back with more from Camden Yards in a moment. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Give me a golf game some day.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Okay. You got a deal."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmemberstheeditorialboardthenewyorkpostnewyorkcity","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1] Well, [INTERVIEWED], first of all our genuine appreciation for sparing us the time. We know your schedule is very busy, and we know that time is limited. So, we'd like to get down to business right away.","[INTERVIEWED]. All right. Well, let me say I'm appreciating your paper and its upholding of our country and the principles that involved and so forth very refreshing.","[INTERVIEWER1] Well, we shall continue to do so. Lebanon","[INTERVIEWED], it would seem that congratulations are in order over your efforts to bring about a Lebanon cease-fire. However, all Mideast cease-fires seem to be fragile at best, and we're wondering what are the contingency plans if the cease-fire breaks down. Secretary Shultz has said there is no timetable to pull out the marines, says that goes for the Navy as well.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I think right now this is a first step. We know that it's a tenuous one and that it's a very complex problem that has to be worked out. But it is right in line with the mission that took the whole multinational force there to be in a position to help preserve stability as a government of Lebanon reinstitutes its sovereignty over its own territory and the foreign forces get out.","[INTERVIEWER1] [INTERVIEWED], you said yesterday that the Saudis played an important part in the helping to bring the cease-fire about. Did they put pressure on Syria by threatening to withhold their bankrolling?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know of any pressure of that kind. But I do know that just as we had two ambassadors there who were back and forth working virtually around the clock, trying to bring the various parties together, they were most helpful in doing the same thing and, I think, have to be recognized for that. So, I wouldn't know what persuasion was used or anything else, but finally we have the cease-fire.","[INTERVIEWER1] On October the 15th, Paul Laxalt and others will be forming the committee for your reelection. Can you say at this stage if you have made up your mind to run? If not, will you at least endorse Mr. Laxalt's committee?","[INTERVIEWED]. At least I would endorse what?","[INTERVIEWER1] Mr. Laxalt's committee.","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh. Well, no, let me just say I don't think this is a time when I can make an answer of any kind to that question. First of all, I believe that campaigns are too long anyway. But I've said there is no way that I'm going to make or announce a decision until the last possible moment that it could be done, because either way it's going to make things difficult. If you're not a candidate, you're a lameduck, and if you are a candidate, suddenly everything you try to accomplish is viewed as part of the political campaign.","So, I know there's coming a day when I'm going to have to make a statement, but not now.","[INTERVIEWER1] Have you discussed the possibilities yet with your family?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously this has come up in conversation.","[INTERVIEWER1] Will you endorse the committee that's being formed, though? Is it with your blessing?","[INTERVIEWED]. That would be getting into the area of commenting that I still don't think I should.","[INTERVIEWER1] When do you think, [INTERVIEWED], the day may come when you'll have to make a decision public? Do you see it within the next month or so, perhaps?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I haven't set any specific date, and so I won't hazard one. But, as I say, I know that such a day is coming, that there is reality alone says that a decision must be announced.","[INTERVIEWER1] You had a rather historic meeting of prayer with Cardinal Cooke yesterday. How did you find that very brave man?","[INTERVIEWED]. Very brave. And it was just amazing. He expressed his interest in so much that's going on in the world and some of the things that we're trying to do. And it was a moving experience. But also we were so grateful for the opportunity to see him and have this meeting with him. They had arranged a little prayer service in his chapel, but not with him present. But we then went to his room, and he concluded the service before our visit with the final prayer.","[INTERVIEWER1] Senator D'Amato of New York and many others have been very forceful in their language calling for Mr. Watt to resign. What are your views about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think Mr. Watt has done a very capable job as Secretary of Interior. I think we have to point out with all of this that it was an unfortunate remark. It certainly was a mistake, and he has admitted that both those points. He has apologized not only to me, but he's apologized to the people on the Commission for that. But I think in all fairness we have to recognize that, yes, it was a very improper thing to say, but it certainly was not said in the sense of any bitterness or bigotry or prejudice. If I thought he was bigoted or prejudiced, he wouldn't be a part of our administration. It was an attempt at lightness that, as we all have to admit, fell very fiat. And it was unfortunate.","So, I think that we have to recognize that, hope it won't be repeated.","[INTERVIEWER1] Do you think it'd be possible for him to continue in office? [INTERVIEWED]. What's that?","[INTERVIEWER1] Do you think it would be possible for him to continue in office?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that's a decision that he, himself, would have to make, whether he feels that he has made it questionable as to whether he can be effective or not.","[INTERVIEWER1] You have no plans, [INTERVIEWED], to ask him to leave, then? [INTERVIEWED]. No. I accepted his apology.","[INTERVIEWER1] If we could turn to your speech at the United Nations today, which is very calm and very measured. Had you, while you were preparing the speech, had any indication or signal of any sort that your proposals might be agreeable to the Soviets?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you can always hope. What I said today I've thought for some time the things that needed saying, both with regard to the United Nations and to their approach to these matters. I just feel very deeply that if and when I remarked about governments starting wars, that if the representatives of the Soviet Union and ourselves sat down at those tables, those negotiating tables, with the conviction in our minds that there must not be a war, then there won't be a war, and there could almost instantly be a reduction in those terrible and dangerous arms, those weapons. I'm certain that the Russian people don't want a war, and I know our people don't. We don't. And I just do are they willing to come to the table with that idea in mind, instead of an idea as to how they can preserve some margin of superiority for themselves.","[INTERVIEWER1] heard, [INTERVIEWED], has there been the slightest signal of the overall regret expressed by some segments of the Soviet leadership, which there has been, small as it may be. Have you regarded that as any kind of genuine signal?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, because I don't think it's come from the kind of people that normally would give the signals. But it is an indication there of, certainly, recognition on the part of some, as you say, that this was as terrible a deed as we have said it was. And I just think the world is owed an apology plus a statement to the effect that they're going to join the rest of us in cooperating to see that such a thing can never happen again. And that could be aided and abetted also if they would recognize some responsibility in compensation for the families of the victims.","[INTERVIEWER1] [INTERVIEWED], do you think there may be some sort of a high-level political dispute going on in the Kremlin, that the statements by these lower level officials, which were just referred to, may represent and in fact there isn't unanimity in there on what happened?","[INTERVIEWED]. I wouldn't hazard a guess on that. But I do say that there is evidence that is a little different than what we usually expect, because usually the official reply comes out with unanimous support over there, and that's it, and that's the story everyone tells. So, this has been a little different, that there have been voices that have begun now. They weren't heard for quite a while.","In fact, there was such a difference in the stories that it just further added to the evidence of how deliberate and despicable this act was. Most people are tending to forget that their first statement was that they just didn't know anything about it. It just disappeared from their radar. And then when the evidence was presented that it had been shot down and that they were responsible for that, suddenly they come up with a new story about spy plane and so forth. No one's mentioned this yet, but isn't that a pretty hardthe idea of errora pretty hard thing to believe, when that plane is one on a regular schedule, that at least every week is flying that same route and at the same time of day?","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], are your plans firm Manila? [INTERVIEWED]. What's that?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are your plans firm for Manila?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the trip is still planned. If there would be any reason to change it, it would be domestic, because there is a probability  we had planned that trip with the idea that Congress would not be in session, that it would have gone home. And that is questionable now as to whether they're going to go home. And now it makes you wonder, how can you be in two places at once? But don't take that as an indication. So far the trip is still on.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The First Lady had expressed second thoughts, misgivings about that particular trip, given the recent events, the recent, tragic events.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me just say and I sympathize with her very deeply, but since a previous experience that we had ,I shouldn't use the expression \"she's a little gun shy.\"  No, but she does feel a legitimate concern and in many places where I have to appear.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], just to come back to your speech to the U.N. today and your three proposals, I was struck let me not talk for everyone, because we haven't all talked about it but it struck me as being rather generous towards the negotiating position, in the view that they've constantly said no, and you say, \"Well, all right, now, we'll count the aircraft, and we won't count the missiles in the Far East. So that would reduce the total number to which we are responding in Western Europe.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Ah, but we reserve the right to place in other areas ","[INTERVIEWER1] Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. to counter what other threats might be involved in their disposition in other areas of their missiles.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, and you go very far towards meeting the Soviet position over the Pershings, which they've been making the most noise about.","[INTERVIEWED]. Maybe that was a restatement of something that was always in our mind. The original concept of what was going in NATO in INF was going to be a mix of Pershings and cruise missiles. And at one time, there was a Russian voice raised that, well, they might listen to cruise missiles but not Pershings at all. Well, this in a way today was a restatement that, no, there will still be a mix, but we are willing that if they agree to reductions, that means that our original figure must be reduced. That reduction will be in both Pershings and cruise missiles.","But as I said in the remarks, I'd like to see it on the zero-zero basis. We know that can't be. Well, now we want any reduction that can be achieved is going to be better than what threatens us now and threatens our allies in Europe. And so, that's what we're going to continue to strive for, is to the lowest possible point that they will come, and we will meet them on an equal and a verifiable basis.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you've been at the U.N and there have been reports out of your administration that you and some of your senior aides feel that there is a double standard operating for example, being quick to condemn Israel for its invasion of Lebanon but not condemning the Soviet downing of the airliner or the Libyan invasion of Chad. Do you feel after being here that there is a double standard?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, I've noticed that many times they on many votes have been able to marshal a majority of votes their way and not on ours. What I was trying to point out was again the something happens to the whole concept of the U.N. if we find the U.N., like the world, beginning to divide up into blocs. The ideal was supposed to be that every nation would be there as an individual and seeking the same thing, the things that are called for in the charter of the U.N. And there has been evidence of the other, of kind of taking sides or bloc voting, and I was just trying to call their attention back to the original purpose.","I'll tell you, may I say something else about that, too? It's time that all of us recognize that maybe we're not as civilized as we were when I was a young man growing up. By that I mean that it was taken for granted for years and years, the days prior to World War II, that all the rules of warfare were aimed at limiting warfare to warriors and providing protection and neutrality for civilians. And without quite realizing it's happened, we're in a world today where not only are the civilians fair game, but the most potent weapons systems, the nuclear weapons, are definitely aimed at the destruction of civilians. And wouldn't it be nice if in a forum of this kind we could get back to being as civilized as we once were?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Since we're in New York, could we ask you a question about the Jewish vote? In 1980 you scored a very high proportion of the Jewish vote for a Republican, but since then, it has been suggested that support has dwindled. Do you think it would be possible to recapture that element in your 1984 strategy?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I never conceded that we lost them. I think we have more to offer them than the other side does. And, no, I haven't felt that at all. I know that sometimes in all of this debate with regard to the peace plan and all, there were times when the Israelis and ourselves found ourselves differing on various points. But that never in any way and they knew this as well; the Israelis knew this that never slackened in any way or weakened the resolve of this country, which has existed since 1948, of a moral obligation to see that the State of Israel continues to exist as a nation. [INTERVIEWER1] Thank you, sir.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Could I ask one last question? [INTERVIEWED], I wonder if I could ask you as an astute political observer, not as a [INTERVIEWED], who you think amongst the Democratic candidates for President might be the toughest candidate?","[INTERVIEWED]. If I knew the answer to that one, I wouldn't give it to you.  Why should I help them make their decision?  "," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorps","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm delighted to take questions. I just had a long telephone conversation with Helmut Kohl -- very interesting. Maybe Marlin already told you about that.","Mr. Fitzwater. I did mention that you'd made a call.","[INTERVIEWED]. He called me, following his suggestions on the German question. And I feel comfortable; I think we're on track.","I've been in close touch with our allies -- in fact, talked to every single one, as I said yesterday, in NATO. And I've talked to Kaifu in Japan, talked to others around that aren't exactly tied into this, and I'm feeling very well prepared.","We've had a series of briefings at the Cabinet level and expert level, outside specialist level. And so, I've still got a little more reading to do and talking to our team that will be there, but it's taking proper shape.","I'd be glad to take some questions.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you look at the events that have transpired in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union -- the upheaval, if you will -- do you think the period of greatest danger for the West has now passed, or does it still lie ahead?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of greatest danger?","[INTERVIEWER]. Of greatest danger in coping with this. The risk of","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I haven't seen danger in coping with it up until now. Maybe I misunderstand your question. I mean, what we've done is to certainly rejoice in the rapid change, but I haven't seen threats at this moment to reverse the change. In other words, I think Gorbachev has said that he's not going to intervene in this change. He's taken a very broad view of it.","And so, we haven't felt imminent danger in what has transpired so far, but what I think you want to do is to conduct yourself in a way that you don't inadvertently contribute to an atmosphere of danger or create a danger where one need not exist. And that would mean avoid some of the more flamboyant posturing that has been urged on me from time to time. That's not a way you conduct the foreign affairs of this country.","And I'll tell you what's reassuring on that, Jerry, is the reaction again from our allies. They've been rather complimentary of the posture of the United States, as they see it.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if Gorbachev -- as a result of strikes and famine, say, in the Soviet Union this winter -- felt the need to crack down sharply, would that be the end of perestroika? Would it be the end of the warmup in relations and a renewal of the cold war?","[INTERVIEWED]. It would be dumb for me to respond to such a hypothetical question. I'm not going to do that -- I'm simply not, and I've taken that position steadily. I get asked that, and I simply am not going to take that position.","Clearly, I think everybody would know that we would take a very dim view of military force to change the course of events, and yet I would compliment Gorbachev for not taking that action. So, for me to hypothecate that he's going to do that, or speculate on what happens -- I simply would respectfully ask not to be pursued on that because I'm not going to answer.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I was told that during some of your sessions with experts one of the things you wanted to know from them was what they thought Gorbachev's goals would be for the summit and, if they were you, what their goals would be. As a result of all your preparations, have you formalized concrete goals for yourself for the summit? And if you have, can you share those with us?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, we've got some objectives, but the goals remain the same: an open agenda meeting where we discuss a wide array of issues. And I'll raise some. I talked about one yesterday that clearly everybody knows I'd raise -- let me just reassert it here -- the question of Central America and Soviet -- --","Q. But, sir, your personal -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Put it this way, Maureen: There's been no change, in my view, as to what this meeting is to be about. Events have changed more rapidly since the genesis of the meeting than I thought, but there is no shift. And I've seen nothing authoritative from the Soviet Union to make me think they're looking at it differently.","There may be more of an urgency to it -- I would say that. And I would say that if we hadn't suggested such a meeting at the end of July that -- given the rapid changes that have taken place, particularly in Eastern Europe -- we probably would have gone ahead and suggested such a meeting within the last month or two. But it hasn't changed -- a lot of speculation, but it hasn't changed.","Q. Have you found a way through your people to send the word to Mr. Gorbachev that you would not appreciate any bombshell surprises?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we've sent the message that we don't think there are going to be any, but if he comes with something, fine. I mean, this is an open thing. He can say anything he wants, but I think he wants to see a successful meeting. And I don't think we want to go -- any side, either side -- no indication that anyone wants to go out of the meeting having a contentious feeling. Certainly we don't, and I've had no evidence from any of the contacts that have been made with the Soviet Union that they're looking for confrontation. And so, I think that it is unlikely there will be something so dramatic that it puts us in an embarrassing position. There's not going to be that -- it doesn't matter. We're part of an alliance, and we're not going to go unilaterally making commitments that affect our allies. And I obviously will feel free to tell Mr. Gorbachev that, but I also have a feeling that he is so well plugged in that I don't need to say that. He'll know it.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], could I ask a post-summit question? You talked about the aspirations over the next 10 years, and at the risk of talking about the \"vision thing,\" could you describe somewhat specifically what kind of things do you see, maybe, say in 5 years with a downsized military? What kind of adjustments will the country have to make, assuming that things go on track as they are now?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think I can definitively answer that until we know what course the arms control agreements take. And we'll know much more about that by the time of the summit meeting which will be held next year. In terms of the \"vision thing,\" the aspirations, I spelled it out in little-noted speeches last spring and summer, which I would like everyone to go back and re-read. And I'll have a quiz on it because they're rather autographed copies and","[INTERVIEWER]. Governor Sununu has given us our copies.","[INTERVIEWED]. Has he? But you'll see in there some of the \"vision thing\" -- a Europe whole and free. Now, that, I think, takes on a little more relevance today, given the changes that have already taken place or that are taking place. Today it's Wednesday, and I don't know what the changes are going to be on Thursday, but it's been more rapid than we saw. I think it's been more rapid than Mr. Gorbachev saw or more rapid than our allies saw. But in terms of your question, I think a Europe whole and free is less vision than perhaps reality. But how we get there and what that means and when the German question is resolved and all of these things -- I can't answer more definitively. I can't answer.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are there dangers, let's say, in the \"peace dividend\"? Are there dangers of dislocation in American industry?","[INTERVIEWED]. Talking about a \"peace dividend\" I agree with that, I'll go back and answer your question. But when you mention \"peace dividend,\" there's almost a -- well, there's an uncalled-for euphoria in some quarters now that suggests that events where they stand today means that the United States can recklessly in my view recklessly cut its defense spending. And we are not in that posture.","We have commitments to an alliance, and that isn't to say that we're going to always have to have exactly the same deployment of forces every place around the world. But we're rethinking all of this, but you can't make a judgment until you get some feeling as to what your allies think and some feeling as to what Gorbachev and the Warsaw Pact countries think.","I interrupted the question because I wanted to say that when I hear now \"peace dividend,\" what that implies to me -- somebody said, well, if you cut defense spending by $10 billion, we can take that money and spend it on something else. They all have a wide array of programs. We can't do that. We've got enormous budget problems facing me. I feel very strongly about it because Darman [Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget] just walked out  and when you see him walking out, I go through a period of about 60 minutes of gloom before I refocus on what else is happening out there. And now I'm back talking about Malta. But seriously, the budget problems that we face -- and all the budgeteers know it -- in 1991 are enormous, so it is premature to talk about a \"peace dividend\" in the sense of take volumes of money out of defense and apply it to some worthy cause. We cannot do that.","Does that answer your question?","[INTERVIEWER]. It was kind of a \"peace dividend\" was only in the sense that I was interested in what kinds of dislocations in American society do you see? I mean, if you're cutting back, let's say again, this is on the premise that things go on track as they are now but assuming that you do have an arms control agreement of some fashion","[INTERVIEWED]. That permits ","[INTERVIEWER]. that permits downsizing armies, how do you kind of approach unemployment in the military? How do you approach the defense industry?","[INTERVIEWED]. That gets back to the fiscal side of the equation have fiscal policies that are so sound that America continues to grow. We've created 20 million you know the litany 20 million new jobs in the last 6 years, or whatever. But be sure that that economy grows to accommodate people.","This is one of the big problems back to the Soviet equation because as they pull back and demobilize, the impact on their economy is very, very difficult right now. They have, I am told, real concerns about dislocation: How do you treat the people coming out of the services? You've got housing problems that make ours pale in comparison.","Now, I don't mean to be mingling into the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, but I have gotten enough information to know that this is very difficult for people. I think it would be less difficult here if we have a strong economy, much less difficult. We do, right now pretty good. The growth isn't as robust as I'd like to see it now, but we're still moving, still growing, still creating jobs.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a moment ago, you said that neither you nor Mr. Gorbachev is looking for a confrontation at Malta. And yet, from yesterday, we learned that you planned very early in your talks to tell Mr. Gorbachev your concerns through Oscar Arias [President of Costa Rica] of the introductions of weapons through Cuba. If you do that, isn't that apt to, one, create some tension in those talks and, two, perhaps cast a pale over the improving relations with the U.S.S.R.?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. I don't want to surprise him, and I would surprise him if I don't raise that subject. No surprises. And he knows how strongly we feel about it -- that was discussed at the [Soviet Foreign Minister] Shevardnadze meeting. I believe that it's been represented to the Soviet Union by Nicaragua that they are not sending arms into the FMLN. And I will be prepared to discuss with keen definition exactly what our complaints are against the Nicaraguan support for FMLN, and I will accurately replay to him what Oscar Arias asked me to replay to him -- his concerns about Cuba's role in all of this.","So, it would be a surprise to him if I didn't raise it. I don't think it has to be contentious because they've already made certain representations to us about not supporting the FMLN.","[INTERVIEWER]. And on El Salvador, it's been","[INTERVIEWED]. What I'd like to do, see, what I'd love to do, is see them swing further over. They're talking about choice and free elections and all these things -- I mean, let's apply that to this hemisphere. I don't think it has to be raised in a way that's going to blow something up, John. I think they expect to talk about it, and we expect to talk about it.","[INTERVIEWER]. On El Salvador, it's, I believe, been more than a week since we sent some experts down there. Are you assured in your own mind that forensic tests are going to show that there is absolutely no government involvement in the slaughter of the Jesuits, and convinced that the Cristiani government is playing on a level field with us?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I believe Cristiani when he says he wants to get to the bottom of it. He's asked for some technical help, he's gotten some, and it is absolutely essential that we keep insisting that the Cristiani government get to the bottom of those killings.","And having said that, I would like to express, lest the question not arise, my concern about the wanton attack by these FMLN guerrillas on the residences of Americans serving in official capacity there in El Salvador. That is unacceptable to us. And what I can do about it, I don't know.","So, get to the bottom of those who killed the priests, absolutely, and they owe us and the rest of the world an explanation on that. The killers must be brought to justice.","Secondly, the FMLN ought to stop shooting up civilian population and trying to undermine an elected government that's been through certifiably free elections. And I am outraged by the attacks on the lives of Americans -- holding Americans in hotels, attacking Americans' residences. And so, I have outrage on both accounts.","[INTERVIEWER]. If I could go back to Europe for a second, [INTERVIEWED]. It's clear that the changes of this year somehow are going to alter the definition of what NATO and the Warsaw Pact are all about. Do you have some ideas or some thoughts about the longrun future of the alliances and how they ought to change to meet these new circumstances that you want to get across to Mr. Gorbachev?","[INTERVIEWED]. One of the things that is responsive in that area is, we began talking at the last meetings of NATO's role and concern on economic problems and on other global problems. That isn't to say that suddenly the mission changes one day from an alliance with strong military component to some economic structure. But I think as threats change, roles change, definitions change. And so again, it's too early to predict how all this will play out, but clearly it's moving in the right direction, and clearly it's moving in a way that should result in a permanent reduction of the tensions that have been the hallmark of the cold war days.","So, I think there's dramatic progress. But I'm sorry, but I still think there's reason to be prudent and cautious. Some others may label it differently, but those are the words I elect. And I have a funny feeling I feel more strongly about that, Jerry, today than I did even 2 or 3 days ago before I started talking to our NATO friends and allies.","[INTERVIEWER]. I was just going to ask quickly about Czechoslovakia because that's where the latest changes have taken place. In your view, has enough happened there to begin the kind of integration and Western aid process that you've had in Poland and Hungary?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not yet. I think you have to see more development. It's obviously exciting. I'll try to be exhilarated here as I this so cameras aren't here, but I want you to report","[INTERVIEWER]. You look exhilarated.","[INTERVIEWED]. Marlin told me the other day, \"Lean forward -- show that you're interested in all of this.\" [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. Put on your glasses.","[INTERVIEWED]. Do something. Don't just sit there. I've taken the hits on being ","[INTERVIEWER]. So has Marlin.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, he sits on your side, somebody's side, the camera's side. But where were we before I got off -- --","[INTERVIEWER]. Czechoslovakia.","[INTERVIEWED]. Events are still a little behind where they are on some of these others, but they're moving so fast. And I certainly like what I'm hearing, but I think -- in answer to your question -- the election process is, I'd say, inevitable, coming along. I mean, they're moving.","You take a look at someplace like Romania -- I mean, my God, I'd like to see some action there. My heavens -- correct that -- I would like to see some action there. I'd like to see them come into the new world and not deprive their people of a chance to be independent and free. I mean, I don't know when that's going to come. We've sent a new Ambassador over there who is a friend of mine, and I sent him there because he is strong and tough and he knows of my conviction about democracy and freedom. I think Punch Green left yesterday, and if anybody can represent our viewpoint -- mine, [INTERVIEWED]'s -- on this matter to Mr. Ceausescu, I believe it's this man. So, we'll be trying, but it's so difficult there.","Czechoslovakia is ahead of that now. Moved faster than we think, but not as far along as certainly as Poland. Maybe in an economic sense, they're better, Jerry. They may have problems -- in fact, they do -- but I would say that they've got less scale, their problems are less intense on the economics front than Poland's. I mean, in my bet. Everyone thinks they've got -- --","[INTERVIEWER]. Get through the winter.","[INTERVIEWED]. these horrible problems.","So, there we are. But, no -- and all of this, I think, will be discussed. And it isn't like I'm going with suggestions to do this about Czechoslovakia and that about Hungary. I want to know what Mr. Gorbachev thinks about this, how he sees it as affecting the Soviet Union itself. I'm one that's been around the track enough to know that there is no fine lines between intervening in the internal affairs of a country and having a frank discussion about the problems facing that country. And I hope Mr. Gorbachev knows that I know the difference, but I want it to be as free and full of discussion as possible. And I'm more concerned about his economic problems, not in some put-down sense or not in trying to be -- hey, we've got a good economy and you don't -- I mean, a one-upsman sense.","But how do we interact? What kind of reforms can the Soviet Union do so we can do more in terms of investment? Shevardnadze said the other day -- somebody asked him about -- I think the question was rather rudely put, I think -- said something about, do you want the United States to bail you out? And he reacted as he should have reacted, with a certain sovereign pride, and said, \"Wait a minute. That's not what this is all about.\"","So, we're not going there with an arrogance. I'm going in the spirit of inquiry and findings ways that we can help and be sure that everything moves forward so this change that the West has been advocating, and clearly the United States has -- change towards freedom and democracy and the people governing themselves -- I mean, it's all moving in the right direction, and we want to keep it going. And Gorbachev has played a very, very constructive role as these events have developed in Eastern Europe.","[INTERVIEWER]. I just wonder, [INTERVIEWED], if there's any chance that or what your thinking is now on the possibilities of a CFE treaty next year and START treaty the following year? Do you think","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we've got to push for them, and I will be obviously bringing those subjects up. I mean, the concept of our wanting to go ahead and conclude agreements there -- and throw in chemical -- I still am very much interested, and I think they are. I've gotten back from them a real interest in moving chemical forward. And it's not just our fault or theirs. We've got other parties that are very much interested in what we do, obviously, in chemical and CFE -- I mean, these are multilateral. And some of the problems on the CFE are alliance problems -- not just shifting the blame to the Soviet Union. So, we can talk about those things, and maybe we'll get some ideas as to how to move them along.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you expect to sign something next year?","[INTERVIEWED]. I hope so. I think that should be our goal, absolutely.","World War II Peace Treaty","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you think there needs to be a peace treaty formally ending World War II?","[INTERVIEWED]. Maureen, eventually, but these matters can all be discussed.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think there should be some sort of conference to work it out or something like that?","[INTERVIEWED]. We're having a conference at Malta to talk about not that subject per se but to talk about a wide array of subjects that will have an eventual bearing on this. I'm not one who believes that the status quo in Berlin, for example, or in the Germanys or in Western Europe, wherever else, has to always be that way. Status quo forever? No.","[INTERVIEWER]. You realize, of course, that Gorbachev is going to be in a state of grace, having just returned from the Vatican. [Laughter] He may take advantage of that. John knows what the state of grace is all about. Catholics  [INTERVIEWED]. Look, Mashek, I want to tell you something. We're trying to separate church and state here.","[INTERVIEWER]. This is my first time wearing glasses. That's why I came -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. You've got good ones -- no bifocals.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's a sure sign of age.","[INTERVIEWED]. What do you need them for? For close in?","[INTERVIEWER]. No, distance, I think.","[INTERVIEWED]. You don't need them for reading?","[INTERVIEWER]. Not yet.","[INTERVIEWED]. Wait until you get a little mileage on that old body.","[INTERVIEWER]. That's soon enough.","[INTERVIEWED]. Are you going? Are you guys all going?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. Where do you stay?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, that's what they tell us.","[INTERVIEWED]. I thought the island was only 17 miles long, from end to end.","[INTERVIEWER]. We're at the other end.","[INTERVIEWED]. Do you want to borrow my boat on Malta so you can -- --","[INTERVIEWER]. It doesn't sound like you're going to see much of Malta.","[INTERVIEWED]. No. The Prime Minister [Eddie Fenech Adami] sent me a beautiful book on Malta. It has marvelous pictures.","Q. How did you happen to think of it? Just because it's so close to Italy?","[INTERVIEWED]. Close, logistically close, and we'd had good reports from our little mission that my brother was on that went over there. I've met the Prime Minister. They are a small country respected by both parties. Certainly, I have a favorable feeling about what they've tried to do, and it seemed like it lends itself very nicely to this concept of a meeting aboard ships. We have some nice anchorage there. Nobody is going to be throwing up.","[INTERVIEWER]. Always a good point.","[INTERVIEWED]. We're thinking of the journalistic profession.","[INTERVIEWER]. Churchill -- didn't he call it a tiny island of history and romance? Which is -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Who said that? Gorbachev?","[INTERVIEWER]. No, Winston Churchill said it about Malta.","[INTERVIEWED]. Is that right?","[INTERVIEWER]. I think; I'll have to check the references, but that was it.","Governor Sununu. [INTERVIEWED] is very partial to falcons.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. There is a sign -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I said to somebody, \"Is there any fishing over there?\" I thought I'd get a chance. And they said, \"The best fishing in Malta is in the harbor where you are.\" I said, \"You've got to be kidding. These ships, these great big ships?\" He said, \"Absolutely. This is where people go.\" So, I've got to figure out -- I don't want to look frivolous.","[INTERVIEWER]. The portholes.","[INTERVIEWER]. CBS will catch you.","[INTERVIEWED]. CBS, are they still picking at you guys for coming in here?","[INTERVIEWER]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. But that's good.","[INTERVIEWER]. This must be the first time you'll be sleeping on a ship in a while. Since your Navy days?","[INTERVIEWED]. No -- well, it couldn't be since the Navy days -- it may, it may be. Bar and I went on a cruise and -- no, I've slept on a boat going down, with my son, down the Potomac River, taking my speedboat around to the Eastern Shore.","Mrs. Bush","[INTERVIEWER]. And your wife is not going on this trip?","[INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. But Mrs. Gorbachev apparently is going.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I don't know what the role will be. But Barbara has the Kennedy Center Honors, which is something that they -- and it's a shipboard meeting, and it didn't seem to lend itself quite as much to the events, things of interest to her, literacy and all that, as other -- where she and Mrs. Gorbachev might constructively interact on their interests. So, it didn't work out.","[INTERVIEWER]. But Mrs. Bush is okay?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, she's fine, thank you. No, she is. She got a good review yesterday. And she's still got it, she's still -- this Grave's disease. But I said to the doctor, I said, \"Is there any secret agenda on this? I mean, it just lags on?\" He said, \"Absolutely not.\" And they've got now Bethesda and Walter Reed and Mayo, and it's just a question of getting the proper balance with the drug or radiation or time. So, thank you for asking, but she"]}

And then the kids they train for what they call their national games or something there. The one that spoke the English, her dad was a coach in Kuwait. And she learned her English over there, and she's a high-jumper. But anyway, it was fun. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. a good mood?","[INTERVIEWED]. Good mood. This visit to Hungary well, Poland also but both of them were very, very moving. And I just come away with this real acute sense now of the change that's taking place in Eastern Europe and a determination to play a constructive role in that change. The meetings with these Hungarian leaders the most recent visit were very good, very frank.","I've been to, what, 77, 79 countries, or something, as Vice President; and these talks were more than just diplomatic. I mean, you didn't rely on the printed card, and they didn't. I mean, they spoke right from the heart. They said what they thought; they made clear the difficulties that they were facing. And I tried to do the same thing. There was something very special and warm and personal about the meetings in both Poland and Hungary.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think you made a difference?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I realize it wouldn't have been diplomatic for any of those leaders to say so, but did you hear any complaints in either place about the sufficiency of the packages you brought?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, and I think you're right: There may be a reason that they wouldn't say so. But I heard none at all, not one. And in fact, Walesa [Solidarity leader], who had been reported to be asking for $10 billion, moved off of that and said that what they wanted were more banks to come in that would loan those kinds of money.","There was a paper written by a Solidarnosc economist that had the figure of $10 billion and had broken it down into x-number of dollars from the World Bank, x from the IMF, x -- and it added up to $10 billion. But there was no pressure of that nature, and then I see that subseQuently Walesa was in the paper today or yesterday saying that there had not been a disappointment.","But I think they understand that we are restricted in what we can do in terms of aid, or dollars of support, for some very worthy project. The thing that's impressive is the determination on the part of all these leaders to move towards economic freedom and political freedom.","It was so clear in Poland. General Jaruzelski [Chairman of the Polish Council of State] -- who has had an image in the States earlier on that was not a very favorable one -- is really out front in the reforms. And conversations were very warm and very frank with him. We'd talk about differences, but we'd also talk about common objectives. And he went out of his way to be hospitable. And then the same thing on the -- what you'd call the private sector side -- Lech Welesa down there.","And the same was true here; we met with the leaders and then, again, the opposition. And then they were all together at a reception. It's -- change is absolutely amazing that's taking place in Eastern Europe.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think that you've made a difference?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I do.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think that was?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the very fact that they can sit and talk to an American President in a reasonable way and I could tell them what I thought we would be able to do, how much we shared their desire for change -- I think was fruitful to them. And I think they saw the friendship and respect for the United States from their people -- the crowds on the street and the -- any time there was interaction with the people it was dramatic. And I'm sure that makes a difference to the leaders. I think it shores up their desire for change because I think it shows all of us the genuine affection for the United States that exists in these countries and, I would say, in the rest of Eastern Europe, too, although I can't speak as authoritatively. I've been t ","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is Poland going to get a government soon?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know, Helen, I don't know. I would say yes, but I can't predict who [INTERVIEWED]'s going to be.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did Walesa seem concerned?","[INTERVIEWED]. We discussed that very openly, but it's just something I can't predict the outcome.","[INTERVIEWER1]. holding them up?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it takes some time after their elections for the Parliament, and I think that they're now trying to sort out, in an arrangement, who to support for President. And you've got several different options. But that's their business; that's the internal affair of Poland, and I ought not to try to get involved in that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did Walesa express any concerns about calling upon workers to make the kind of sacrifices re[INTERVIEWER1]uired? Because that's another problem area.","[INTERVIEWED]. He didn't express concern about that, but I had an opportunity to make clear in private that and publicly that reforms were essential. There's no point going there under false colors and to try to have everything sweetness and light as a message that but it isn't going to be easy. But that's part of the message. The rest of it is that change is in the winds, and I sense it so much more clearly from having been there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you feel the general I mean, you could see a man almost totally resigned ","[INTERVIEWED]. Did I feel what?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Don't you feel that the general sees something besides the inevitable? I mean, he seems to have given up.","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think it's a question of resignation. You see, as you see change take place in the Soviet Union, this opens the way for change vital change, vibrant change in the rest of Eastern Europe. And so, I didn't sense a dejection on his part; I sensed somewhat of an upbeat feeling that, yes, that these changes were possible now. And I certainly sense that in Hungary.","[INTERVIEWER1]. odd man out?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let's wait and see.","Eastern European Reforms","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think your opinions may have encouraged reform in some of the other countries, such as, maybe, Romania or Czechoslovakia or East Germany, or might there be a backlash ","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you want to be careful not to conduct yourself in such a way as to encourage a backlash. But I would think that this visit in the neighborhood would be watched by countries where economic and political change are lagging behind Poland and lagging behind Hungary. That isn't true of the Soviet Union, and it isn't true of Yugoslavia. But there are other countries that are probably watching and wondering. I am firmly convinced that this wave of freedom, if you will, is the wave of the future. And I would expect that this visit has been watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and, hopefully, giving encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform  political change, economic change -- that these other countries are now following.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think they'll feel that talk is cheap from the United States, and what about a little more aid to encourage their reform movement?","[INTERVIEWED]. I didn't sense that. That was their early question, and I didn't sense it. I expect everybody would like to have as much aid as everybody possibly can attract. But when you're tying your position into economic reform and incentive and ownership and private sector and entrepreneurship, it seems to have at least negated the public cry or diminished the public cry for more funds. I just did not encounter that. In fact, a couple of them and I'll leave their names out of it -- said: \"We didn't expect you to come here with a bag full of money\" was the way they put it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you going to tell the summit leaders that communism is dead?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. I'm going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking place in Eastern Europe, and I expect each one of them will want to tell me about their experiences with that. But I want to be sure that they know of our commitment to foster this change in a prudent way.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. I haven't set up any yardsticks for that, Brit [Brit Hume, ABC News]. I don't think that there is a way to measure success at an economic summit. I mean, this isn't a summit where there is one major problem to be solved. There are problems on the agenda, but I expect at the conclusion of the meeting you'll see seven countries in harmony, pulling together on matters like the environment and, you know, the economies of the various countries, and trade. All these are contentious matters bilaterally, but I think we can reach common understanding. So, maybe that would be the yardstick.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Gorbachev to what's going on in Eastern Europe approach seems to be  development in Eastern Europe and that you are a partner, but a limited partner. Isn't it Gorbachev's revolutionary approach to the East-West relationship that has given these people license to move forward? Isn't he glad they're moving forward?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would think so, and maybe you missed what I said about Poland and giving them the flexibility to move forward. So, no, I would certainly say, and I mentioned four countries one of them was the Soviet Union. I don't think you were here when I started talking about that. So, we're very pleased to see the perestroika. And let me repeat for the umpteenth time: I want to see it succeed.","[INTERVIEWER1]. When are you going to tell him that personally?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This year? Geneva?","[INTERVIEWED]. No plans for that right now.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it would be useful?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think there is any misunderstanding on his part about the position of the United States in terms of his reforms. I think maybe if there is ever any doubt about it those doubts have been dispelled; and if there was any recent doubts about it, those doubts will be dispelled by his friends in Poland and in Hungary because I made very clear to them that, you know, we're not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. Gorbachev. Just the opposite to encourage the very kind of reforms that he is championing and more reforms.","[INTERVIEWER1]. convinced that he understands what you're doing?","[INTERVIEWED]. Because there are so many contacts with him and because some of these leaders told me that. And they told me that in terms of our approach to arms also. There has been some suggestion we were dragging our feet on arms control, which is pure nonsense. And I'm convinced from talking to these people that Gorbachev knows that we're serious. Indeed, we have an opportunity now to encourage him to move along faster on conventional force reductions. The idea that some Soviet spokesman yesterday says they can't meet these timetables I don't want to believe that that's Mr. Gorbachev speaking. And I'm not going to believe it until I hear from him or until I hear authoritatively that that's who it is.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Should we not believe Marlin?","[INTERVIEWED]. You can believe Marlin, yes, because he speaks with great authority. But this guy was not a -- I don't think it was a press spokesman. It was a ","[INTERVIEWER1]. It was a lieutenant general that ","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, a lieutenant general.","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- political general.","General Scowcroft. He's their arms control guy.","[INTERVIEWED]. He's a couple of beats behind the pace here, because I don't think Gorbachev wants to slow down an agreement on conventional arms. If he does, he's wrong on that. But I don't believe he does. I think he wants to move forward there and on the strategic arms talks, and so do we. ","[INTERVIEWER1]. From your conversation, did you get any sense of what the bottom line is in Eastern Europe as far as political change? I mean, what are the two or three points that you can't cross?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, there doesn't seem to be a bottom line, because when you go to open, free, fair elections, who knows what's going to happen? Take a look at Hungary I mean at Poland. Take a look at those Polish elections. So, the change is so rapid and so devastating to old ways that I don't think you can put a bottom line on the thing.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Perhaps Gorbachev is also looking at the elections?","[INTERVIEWED]. Probably looking at the elections at home, and that is a good thing. I tell you, the excitement of all this, you just feel it in talking to the leaders and feel it from the people.","[INTERVIEWER1]. specific with both leaders that further economic reform for example, did you discuss with them the sale of state-owned business or getting private enterprise to the people in both Poland and Hungary?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, both, but in varying degrees of detail. Of course, Lech Walesa that was his whole thrust: privatization. And the talks with Mr. Jaruzelski we got into that. Mainly we were talking about joint ventures and partnerships, but also I had the opportunity to emphasize our conviction that state ownership is less productive than private ownership. And similarly, in a couple of the meetings maybe we did in all but in a couple of the meetings yesterday there was discussion of privatization. No resistance, incidentally, it seemed like, in Hungary. But we had a very frank discussion about what percentage of their gross national product was in government and what in private sector, and Hungary still has a long way to go until it achieves privatization.","[INTERVIEWER1]. any Communists or are they all, essentially they're all democratic, pluralistic ","[INTERVIEWED]. I met people that are caught up in this wave of historic change.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What about","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are they changing their whole philosophy? They are Communists, aren't they?","[INTERVIEWED]. You asked whether one of the leaders made a big distinction between a Communist and a Socialist. And one of them pointed out that European socialism could well be the model of the future as opposed to the socialism that we equate with communism.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What about the austerity side of this? Did you get into 2 years ago, the Poles would not get the votes they needed, and then you talk about belt-tightening. But did they talk to you about what they would do? And do you have any qualms that this might backfire that if these supports are removed, the Poles may not get the candy they need to keep supporting the system?","[INTERVIEWED]. I had some feeling after some of the talks that the reforms that would be required would be very difficult for them. That's not universal, but it did come up.","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- in any way communicate that to Gorbachev?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, except indirectly saying please tell Mr. Gorbachev this, that, or the other.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Would you have any plans to contact him","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have regularized contacts with the Soviet Union now, and we will continue on those. But there could be occasion to do that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did Lech Walesa tell you about the powder-keg situation in Poland, as he told TV interviewers?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I said, some of the interlocutors made clear that the kinds of reforms that are going to have to be taken will not be easy. It wasn't put in the context of powder keg.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we spelled out some broad parameters: privatization, openness, free elections. And that's just the American way, that's just our belief as to what works. And to the degree those things take place, why, we will be able to do more.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Walesa? Yes. I'd met him before, and it's funny how you just meet one time and it establishes a certain personal warmth there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you talked about the changes, and you used the word \"amazing.\" Were you surprised by the things you saw?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not textbook surprised, but surprised at the feeling: the feeling and the emotion of it all and the frankness with which the leaders -- in Hungary particularly; well, and also Jaruzelski and Walesa -- talked about the change. I mean it was with emotion, and it wasn't your traditional \"I'll read my cards, and you read your cards\" kind of diplomacy. It was very special in that regard. There's an intensity to it, a fervor to it that moved me very much.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. You mean like in Eastern Europe? Well, I think without the change in the Soviet Union it would have been highly unlikely that Eastern Europe would be achieving the kinds of changes or aspiring to the kinds of changes that it is aspiring to.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, I don't know. I don't ever look for disputes, I look for calming the troubled waters. You know that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know that either.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I want to go to Africa, but there's no doubt -- I wouldn't say that would be the next, would you?","Eastern European Reforms","[INTERVIEWER1]. keep this policy alive?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think it's the U.S. role to keep the change alive. I mean, I think this is something that's the business of the Poles and of the Hungarians. This is their business; this is their life, their country. I think it would be rather arrogant to suggest that it's the United States that has the sole responsibility. That's not your question. But it, to the degree we can encourage change without intervention in the internal affairs -- why, I'm all for that. But that's not our role. This is too fundamental: The people's aspiration for liberty and for free choice is too fundamental. And they can look to our system, look to our country, as a beacon for all these good values. But it's not our role to go in and dictate to any of these countries how they're going to run their business.","[INTERVIEWER1]. tore up that","[INTERVIEWED]. I know that struck you the most about it, because you didn't have to stand out in the rain.","[INTERVIEWER1]. He said they liked that.","[INTERVIEWED]. Did they really? Well, I mean, I had plenty of opportunity to pay my formal respects, which, in essence, was what that was about. And those people had been standing there a long time. I told them the next day one of the leaders was very complimentary of that. And I said it reminds me of an old adage that the United States the speech that you do not  that was the one in the rain.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Who are you going to send to Israel as an emissary?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, there isn't any emissary going from [INTERVIEWED] of the United States. There's no determination of that at this point.","[INTERVIEWER1]. a chance to talk at the Wallenberg Memorial. Have you had any contact at all with the Soviets on that question?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we chose to stop there because Wallenberg is a great international symbol of human rights. And I don't know -- what do you mean about contact about -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, it's a constant issue that U.S. officials are regularly asking of the Soviets ","[INTERVIEWED]. I have not personally asked of the Soviets that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that the Secretary of State might send an emissary?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm saying that we have people go to Israel all the time and to other countries in the area. But when you say, \"Who am I sending as an emissary?\" -- I was putting that in the context of past high-level shuttle diplomats or something of that nature, and there are no plans for that. I reserve the right to send people anytime I think it's in the interest of the United States, but there are no plans for that kind of level -- diplomacy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Why is the U.S. making ","[INTERVIEWED]. But if somebody felt it was worthwhile, somebody over there would welcome a special emissary from [INTERVIEWED], I'd be very openminded about that. But there are no plans. You asked me whether there are plans.","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- find out what's going in terms of -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. We've got a very able Ambassador over there who knows a great deal about what's going on and has excellent contacts with the Government.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think is going on over there? Shamir has simply restated what his position has been all along. Why is the U.S. so shook up over this?","The President. I don't know that the U.S. is so shook up, but they know the United States policy. And the United States policy on settlements, for example, has not changed, and it is not going to change. And so, we might as well be frank with our friends, because that's what friendship is about. And so, I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there, and we want to see the election process go forward. And if anybody can make a case for me that the recent deliberations in that party will enhance the election process, then I'd say, Great! But I'm afraid other people are looking at it, saying, \"What's happened does not enhance the possibilities of election.\" So, the U.S. policy is set. And I'm [INTERVIEWED]of the United States, and Israel is a friend and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is -- and so, I don't think there's great heartburn here, but I want to just continue to articulate what we believe.","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- Shamir said -- what should be important from the very start -- so I'm trying to figure out why the United States is so distressed.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not so distressed. I'm [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWER1]. I mean State Department.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you go ahead and talk to the State Department about that. You're talking to the President. I set the policy, after a lot of input from the State Department, and I want the U.S. policy to succeed. We've thought out very carefully what we think is best, and our support is for our principles. And they've got great difficulties inside of Israel. I understand that. I understand the political pressures. But I can't be varying U.S. policy every day to accommodate political change. I'm not going to do that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How about the Palestinian","[INTERVIEWED]. Keep encouraging them to do what they ought to do: to participate in this election process -- absolutely -- and deplore the kind of violence that we see when a bus is carried over a cliff and carrying a lot of innocent people to their death, or innocent people getting killed in other ways -- on both sides. I mean we have to stand for something. And I'm going to continue to try to do that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. When did you first decide you were President? When did it hit you?","Mr. Fitzwater. That sounds like an essay question to me.","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know. But I'm deciding more and more that I am. Experience never hurt anybody, did it? Experience doesn't hurt. Thank you all."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorps1","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. Fire away.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], what are you going to do about the fact that sensitive and relevant documents were not reviewed by the Iran-contra committees?","[INTERVIEWED]. In the first place, I have great confidence that A.B. Culvahouse [Counsel to President Reagan] and those charged with cooperating with Congress were cooperative; I've seen nothing to indicate they weren't. Secondly, I would offer full cooperation to any request made of this administration, and I just can't confirm the hypothesis of your question at all.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But you mean you would turn over any documents that they now want to see? Is that what you're saying by \"full cooperation\"?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, procedures were set up to determine what documents would be made available. Those procedures were agreed to by the Congress. Certainly, I would see that if any documents are in control of this administration -- relevant documents -- that we would live assiduously by those guidelines. But I have no reason to believe that the previous administration, the lawyers in it who worked closely with Congress, did not fulfill their obligations.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], were you an emissary to Honduras, as has been alleged?","[INTERVIEWED]. I went to Honduras, sure. That's a matter of public record.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And did you have a quid pro quo deal?","[INTERVIEWED]. I've told you that I am not going to discuss that until the trial with North is over.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But the jury is being sequestered today, sir, and it's -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I might have something to say on it when the trial is over, but I would simply ask you to understand that this is a request of the lawyers. And I'm not going to do something that inadvertently will -- but put it this way: My conscience is clear.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, there have been suggestions that -- on the documents -- that there might have been an oversight, either on the part of the FBI, the part of the White House staff. As far as you can tell, was there an oversight by any of those two bodies, or was it a question of -- the Congress was not pushing the right buttons to get the documents?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm not sure. I don't know. All I can just state is the confidence that I feel in Culvahouse and company. But we've received the letter down here, and I will take this opportunity to tell them we'll cooperate fully. But who controls the documents and all of that -- you'll have to talk to the lawyers about that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], when you say -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I think they're in the control and in the custody of the Archives archivists, but I'm not sure.","[INTERVIEWER1]. When you say you'll cooperate fully with -- I presume you mean Senators Mitchell and Inouye [member and chairman of the Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition, respectively]. In their letter -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Everybody.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Does that mean -- they've asked you, I think, to launch an investigation to find out exactly what happened. Are you saying you will launch an investigation or that you have?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't remember \"launching an investigation.\" Was that part of their request?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I think the language is \"an immediate and thorough investigation\" which essentially asks whether and why documents were not provided.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would refer them to the people that were in charge of the documentation, which would be Mr. Culvahouse and company, in whom I have great confidence. But if there's anything we can do to encourage that -- absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], when you say your conscience is clear, do you mean that the interpretation that has been made of the documents in this trial, which I gather were made by Mr. North himself, are not entirely accurate?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not discussing anything about my role in this except to say that everything I've said I'll stand behind.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You won't even -- since they're sequestered -- just give us a -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I've just told the gentleman that I'm not going to go into that. So, please, don't ask me to do that which I've just said I'm not going to do, because you're burning up time. The meter is running. Throw the sand on you -- --","Semiautomatic Weapons","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right. Assault weapons.","[INTERVIEWED]. And I am now filibustering, so -- [laughter].","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, can I ask you about assault weapons?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, no, you've already used up your time.","[INTERVIEWER1]. No, no, no. Assault weapons. You know, William Bennett, your drug czar, has made a proposal that you treat them like machineguns, which would mean people would register and they'd have their names on file and so forth. First off, what do you think of that idea? And secondly, when are you going to tell us your next step on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we're having a meeting this afternoon with certain Members of Congress on this. The standards that are set up in existing law about import are: \"suitability for sporting purposes.\" And we're being very careful here, but we're going to make a determination using that as a standard. And, Lesley [Lesley Stahl, CBS News], I can't say exactly when it will be, but I've expressed my concern about these weapons and their suitability. So, stay tuned. I don't know exactly when it will be, but there is a meeting here today that's just ongoing, and I have great confidence in Bill Bennett.","We've talked to a wide array of people on this. We've gone to some of the think tanks -- that very intelligent, thoughtful paper from Ed Feulner's [president, Heritage Foundation] group over at Heritage, very thoughtful. And so, our package will be -- I guarantee it will include more on law enforcement. And I'm sure that Bill Bennett will be totally on board. But we haven't gotten the final administration position yet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], will you apply the same standard to domestically made weapons that you apply to imported weapons?","[INTERVIEWED]. We're in the process of discussing that now and what role the administration has -- whether it's strictly restriction of imports or something broader than that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. At this point, are you convinced that any package that deals with drug violence and crime must also include some aspect that deals with assault weapons?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, I can't say that. I can't go that far, because we really haven't gotten that far in determining it.","President's Popularity","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], the CBS-New York Times poll this morning puts your approval rating at about 61 percent but suggests there is more style than substance. What do you think about that evaluation? And I think that you and Governor Sununu have been briefed by a Teeter poll that's been taken. Does that contain the same sort of information?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, the Teeter poll -- I'm not sure it's just because the committee paid for it -- is much stronger. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Higher ratings?","[INTERVIEWER1]. What about the Iowa?","[INTERVIEWED]. Higher, higher, higher. I'm not sure. I don't want this to be considered a vicious assault on CBS. [Laughter] They're entitled to their polling figures. But the others were -- look, these things -- you know me on polls, John [John Mashek, Boston Globe]. You've heard me on this subject before, and I haven't changed my view. It's not a question of polls, but a question of what's going on, achieving what you're trying to do.","And we're making some progress here. I'm very pleased that the Senate did what it did on the savings and loan bill, pleased that we got a budget agreement that many cynics thought we could never achieve at all, no matter of what scope, whatsoever -- that took place. And so, I've been very pleased with the recent talks on the Middle East with three leaders there. And so, things are moving. But I don't feel under any pressure to meet somebody else's standard on what is progress or not. I know what I'm doing, and I think one thing is the country senses that. Otherwise, there wouldn't be that kind of support.","Aid to Cambodian Non-Communists","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], are you going to offer military aid to the non-Communist resistance in Cambodia?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, no discussion of that yet, no decision taken on that yet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], we're coming -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll continue to give good support to the process and certainly to [President] Sihanouk's efforts.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did you say no decision or no discussion on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. No decision and -- not with me -- can't recall, but I'm not anywhere close to making a decision of that nature.","Administration Accomplishments","[INTERVIEWER1]. We're coming up to the 100-day mark on your Presidency, which -- if you'll look over the past 50 years, every other President, or almost every other President, has come into office at times of crisis, and crisis has been kind of a stage on which we watch Presidents perform. How would you assess your first 100 days so far?","[INTERVIEWED]. About the same as Martin Van Buren's.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Uh-oh.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can you elaborate on that? [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin came in; he was not radically trying to change things. But then, that's about where the parallel ends, because I don't know what he did in his first 100 days. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- or any of the other 900 days.","[INTERVIEWED]. We got an agenda, and I've clicked off things that I think demonstrate progress. And I left out the whole question of an ethics package that I think is a very good one. We've had many visitors from foreign lands. We've moved forward on -- I want to add now to what I was saying -- moved forward on Third World debt in a positive way.","So, I think that we're moving reasonably well. And I don't even think in terms of 100 days because we aren't radically shifting things; this is the Martin Van Buren analogy. We didn't come in here throwing the rascals out to try to do something -- correct all the ills of the world in 100 days. Now, there's some ills of the world; there's some unsolved problems. And I'm methodically, I think, pragmatically moving forward on these. So, I really don't measure it in terms of 100 days.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I guess we are the ones who measure the 100 days.","[INTERVIEWED]. You are.","Foreign Policy","[INTERVIEWER1]. Foreign policy has been kind of held back. You've had visitors, but do you expect the pace of your foreign policy to pick up after this?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not sure I understand the question.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, the pace -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. The pace of it? No, I don't. The pace of it is pretty intense -- numbers of visitors, amount of time I spend on foreign policy, initiatives taken by the Secretary of State, attention given to this in the White House, every single day. So, you see, I think we've got prudent foreign policy. We've set into forward motion certain reviews that are moving towards completion. And so, I don't feel a need for some precipitous and dramatic initiative in order to salve the consciences of those who are saying you've got to do something in 100 days.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Let me go back -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. These reviews won't trigger something then?","[INTERVIEWED]. It could; it might. But I think Gorbachev -- on the Soviet East-West relations -- understands what we're about. I, frankly, thought that what we said on Poland the other day was new and a strong initiative. But that takes time to sort out these things. But I didn't do it because I wanted to get in under the 100-day wire. Now, the question is: We've spelled out what we want to do, and I've got to move our bureaucracy to see that we do it.","And you know, it's that kind of concept on the Middle East -- spent a lot of time on the Middle East. And I think King Hussein was right when he said yesterday that the time is right for some kind of action. But now we've got to assess, after he leaves here, where we go, what next step we take. We've got something out there on elections that offers some promise. We haven't backed away from historic positions on conference or whatever. And so, we move -- we take whatever the next step is.","I wish I could give you a more dramatic answer to the Lebanon, because this is one that really does hurt. And I'm very, very concerned about it. And here all I can say to you is that we have encouraged the Secretary-General to go forward, to try this mission of peace. There's some stumbling blocks to that; I'm told we will renew our call for removal of all foreign troops and for a cease-fire.","But here is one where I wish that there was some dramatic plan in which the players in the area could agree to, and it's not there. And we've talked to the Middle Eastern leaders. But I cite this one because I really feel it -- about the Lebanon, of the divisions in Lebanon. We've talked to the Brits about it. We've talked to the French about it -- and President Mitterrand the other day. And the people at the U.N. are trying to figure. But there is not a dramatic plan that can bring peace to Lebanon right now.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that a problem that defies solution?","[INTERVIEWED]. The problem -- the short-run of it -- how you stop this firing, the shelling, how you get factions to stop warring -- has certainly in recent times defied solution. But we can't give up on it. We simply are not going to -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. How has the U.S. managed to provide any kind of influence in the situation?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's the problem: We don't have great influence in Lebanon, with the factions that are fighting. We do have good influence with many of the countries out there. In fact, I think our standing with the moderate Arab countries is as good today as any time in recent history. And I feel strongly about that. And back to the Martin Van Buren theory -- I mean, we're building still, coming back out of a time that hit a bit of a low 3 or 4 years ago. Then we restored some prestige by the way we acted in the Gulf. Then you see a cease-fire in the Gulf. We have, I think, much better communication now with Jordan. We've kept good cooperation and coordination with the Egyptians. The Israelis themselves attest to the fact that they have great confidence in our administration. We have some differences with all three of those countries, but, no, I think it's moving. But, Norm [Norman Sandler, United Press International], I wish there was a short-term answer to stop the killing in Lebanon.","Strategic Weapons Modernization","[INTERVIEWER1]. -- -- you missed a couple of deadlines -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], could I -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. You've missed a couple of deadlines on the MX missile, on what you're going to do to modernize the strategic arsenal -- go MX, Midgetman. And Mr. Cheney gave you some recommendations this week, and a decision is expected this week. What are you going to do on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Don't know yet. We'll obviously be talking to Cheney when he comes back from NATO. But no decision has been taken.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Any leaning?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, can't tell you that. I'm listening -- because this exercise yesterday in this Cabinet Room was not just a semantic drill of some sort. When I talk about cooperation with Congress, I mean it -- consultation with Congress, I mean it. And some of what yesterday was about was getting the views of various Members of Congress on this decision that's facing [INTERVIEWED]. But how do you -- you know, what do you do about SDI and levels of funding? What do you do about MX or Midgetman? And I have to make the call, the recommendation, from here; but I wanted to get their input. Now I want to get renewed talks with Dick Cheney when he comes back. The national security adviser has provided me with a lot of thinking on this, had several important briefings on it. And I will be prepared very soon to make a decision on it. But we haven't -- I can't go any further than that.","Middle East Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you met now with [Egyptian President] Mubarak, [Israeli Prime Minister] Shamir, and [Jordanian King] Hussein. What is the next step in the Middle East peace process?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not sure now. On the table is the election process, and one other thing would be how we flesh that out, taking into consideration the concerns about it that have been expressed by Mubarak and by King Hussein and also by Mr. Shamir. So, how we do that -- what the modalities are of that -- a lot of thought will be going into that: who's represented; making clear that this isn't a final step, that that isn't going to solve the Middle East problem; making clear that it's a step, but we want it to be a constructive step; and exploring other options as well.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What is the structural procedure for doing that?","[INTERVIEWED]. On the U.S. side, we'll use the National Security Council procedures to do that. And of course, I plan to be in touch with the various leaders. I've told them I want to do that as President. And I do plan to talk personally with some of the leaders out there on these matters -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is this a high priority?","[INTERVIEWED]. -- -- in addition to the ones I've already talked to. For example, I talked to King Fahd [of Saudi Arabia] the other day, and think that that is useful, to be sure. Now, after this round of visits, what do they think? A lot of these countries can be important players here, and the more agreement we can get on the next step, the more likely it is to succeed.","U.S.S. \"Iowa\"","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], on the Iowa: Is it time to say that 50-year-old battleships are, in fact, obsolete and begin taking them out of service? Is that the lesson here?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, that's -- --","[INTERVIEWER1]. Or if not, what's your lesson on it?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's not -- well, my lesson is that -- to find out what happened in infinite detail, check all procedures to be sure that safety is at the highest point, and -- but not -- I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that that makes a useful platform obsolete. I'm not going to go that far.","Drug Testing","[INTERVIEWER1]. Could you indulge me one quick question because of a conflict that the Attorney General suggested yesterday?","[INTERVIEWED]. John, give me a break.","[INTERVIEWER1]. One quick one. The Attorney General -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Is this for TV or is this for the print?","[INTERVIEWER1]. TV.","Q. Both. The Attorney General suggested yesterday that it might be appropriate to drug-test people in public housing. HUD took immediate exception to that. What do you think?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'd have to talk to him about it because I don't know, and I'm not going to go off on some tangent here until I know exactly the thinking of our key Cabinet people. We've got a good Cabinet system, and I encourage people to speak out. But the decisions on something of that nature will be made right here in that room, and they're not going to be made until I have all the facts.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You don't favor a drug -- --","Interest Rates","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you expect interest rates to come down now that you've got a budget agreement?","[INTERVIEWED]. I was very pleased at the market reaction to the budget agreement. It seems to have been underreported, but nevertheless, it's very heartening, Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].","[INTERVIEWER1]. How about the interest rates? You said you were going to campaign -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not heartened by the interest rates. [Laughter]","Drug Testing","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is there still going to be those drug tests for the Federal employees?","[INTERVIEWED]. Selectively, yes, absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Selectively? To everybody?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we've already got some patterns out there -- well, widely. If we're talking about a drug-free workplace, we've got to have some testing, and I support that. This idea that this is a total infringement on everybody -- I don't agree. Now, in some cases -- I mean, I don't want it to be so widespread, but I do think that selective drug testing is very important, and nobody will change my mind on that one.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Civil rights? Human -- no?","[INTERVIEWED]. Civil rights is very important, too -- and so is the law."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresscorpsthesituationpanama","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me take a couple of questions. But first, a word about Panama, just to be very clear. And if I were speaking to the Panamanian people, I would tell them that the affection of the American people for the people of Panama is still very much intact, strong. Secondly, I would say to the Panama Defense Forces, the PDF, they have a useful role to play, and they will in the future of Panama have a useful role to play. The problem is not the PDF, per se; the problem is Noriega.","And if Noriega were to leave office, we would have good relations with Panama. We would have good relations with the Panama Defense Force. And clearly, the good feelings between the American people and the people of Panama would grow and prosper. And so, I would hope that Noriega would leave and that the results of this election would be recognized. The fraud in the election has been condemned by people all across the world; the European Community, leaders in our hemisphere, all the way to Japan -- people speaking out in indignation against this thuggery and against what the man has done.","So, I just want to be sure that the people of Panama understand that relations can quickly return to normal if Mr. Noriega will leave and set aside his dictatorship and permit democracy to prevail.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think they have any doubt about that? And aren't you calling for a coup on the part of the PDF? I mean, the Catholic Church in Panama also has basically been saying the same thing to the PDF. Are you saying","[INTERVIEWED]. That I just said?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that you would like the PDF to get Noriega out?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would love to see them get him out. We'd like to see him out of there -- not just the PDF, the will of the people of Panama.","[INTERVIEWER1]. It sounds like you're calling on the people of Panama to rise up and basically have a revolution. Is that what you're trying to say?","[INTERVIEWED]. A revolution -- the people rose up and spoke in a democratic election, with a tremendous turnout, said what they wanted. The will of the people should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of these Doberman thugs. That's what I'm saying.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think the people should do now?","[INTERVIEWED]. The people should do everything they can to have the will of the people respected. They ought to heed the international calls, and they ought to just do everything they can to get Mr. Noriega out of there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Have you been in conversation and contact with President Cerezo and others? Venezuela apparently has offered Noriega asylum. Have you been in contact with the Venezuelans, and do you have thoughts on when and where Noriega should go?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, but I have no doubt that countries would receive him.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Why, have you had any assurances indirectly on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have a habit of not liking to go into detail with what I talk to others about. But I'm just confident that they would receive him, and I think Noriega knows this, too.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You said the other day that you would not favor dropping the drug indictments. But if he were to go to someplace that, either through prearrangement or postarrangement, did not have extradition arrangements with the U.S., how would you feel about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that could well be an answer. That could be a solution.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What? Going to a country that","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, because if he has -- no, he was saying, if there was a country that prohibited extradition -- and he ought to think about that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Would you allow him to go to a country","[INTERVIEWED]. think we have any control over that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Would you allow him into a country that didn't have an extradition","[INTERVIEWED]. He can go anywhere he wants. But I am obligated as [INTERVIEWED] of the United States to respect our laws and to go forward on fulfilling obligations under the law. But if he went to a place where there wasn't any extradition treaty, then that would be a different situation than if he went to a place where there was an extradition treaty.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you care which one he does?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'd like him to -- well, I care that he does whatever it is that it takes to get him out of there right now. And that's what I'd like to see happen.","[INTERVIEWER1]. more than getting him","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it's right for the people of Panama. It's right for the democracies in this hemisphere. You cannot have an election that is blatantly stolen, where people that win are beaten up by thugs.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So far, you have struck out -- and so did President Reagan -- in trying to get him out of power. Do you have any other options?","[INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, they haven't been successful.","[INTERVIEWED]. Still at the plate, and we'll stay at the plate until we can help the people of Panama have the democracy for which they spoke so articulately in an election. And we're not going to give up on it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This effort will not be a success until he leaves, right?","[INTERVIEWED]. No effort can be a success until he leaves. That's right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A couple of days ago, you said that the goal of your sending those extra troops down there was to protect American lives. Now you seem to be adding a new, much more outspoken dimension to your intention here, which is to see Noriega leave and leave","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not changing the definition of the role of the American troops at all.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Have you had any contact with him indirectly, sir, in the last 2 days?","[INTERVIEWED]. Last 2 days? No.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How about directly","[INTERVIEWED]. No, you asked the question properly.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How does it feel personally, after over a year of seeing this drag on -- -- now this thing comes to a head? How does it feel when you read the accounts and see the pictures?","[INTERVIEWED]. See, I think there's a whole new ingredient in Panama, regarding the relationship with Panama. And the ingredient is the election. And I think the election made so clear that the people want democracy and made so clear that that democracy is being thwarted by one man that that in itself could be the catalyst for removing Noriega.","Now, why do I say that? Because, heretofore, you have not heard the neighboring countries around Panama speaking up. Now they're speaking up loud and clear. You have not heard the Church as indignant as it is now. You have not seen the EC [European Community], our friends in Europe, speaking up and denouncing what happened. And I think the Japanese weighed in on this. So, I think this is a very different climate now and one much more conducive to possible change, because the people spoke so overwhelmingly, and heretofore, that has not been quite as clear. Never underestimate the power of the people, even though their will seems to have been frustrated short-run.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think the OAS [Organization of American States] will do something on Wednesday?","[INTERVIEWED]. Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International], I would hope so, and I think it would be helpful if they did. And I'd love to see a very powerful and strong statement coming out of there, and I'd like to see it as unanimous. But I'm not sure what will come out of it. But I think it's well worth the effort.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED] -- you're worried about the people in Panama and what they've gone through, and it's in their hands. Are you concerned, though, about any violence that might be started by anything that the people would do to change the situation where innocent lives may be lost or children would be hurt and families disrupted as they try to make a change for democracy?","[INTERVIEWED]. I always worry about the loss of innocent human life. And I would be worried about that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What about American","[INTERVIEWER1]. Would you caution them against rising up in violence?","[INTERVIEWED]. American life? We will protect American lives in every possible way. That is a solemn responsibility of [INTERVIEWED], and that's one of the reasons I augmented our forces in Panama -- is the reason I augmented them.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you concerned that the situation there -- with your calls and mounting pressure internationally -- would lead to a situation right now in Panama that might lead to violence that would, in fact, endanger American lives more than they would be otherwise?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's too hypothetical. I mean, I would be concerned about any escalation of violence that would endanger American lives. And I think we're in a good position to protect our American lives and interests.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], your words could be seen, though, as inciteful, basically saying to the Panamanian people that it's up to them: Don't let it die. Your will seems to have been thwarted, but you've got to hang tough. The people could see that as inflammatory, like it's a call to -- -- to revolt. Would you add any words of caution","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I would add no words of caution. The will of the people should be implemented. And if I wanted to increase the rhetoric, strengthen it, I would do so. But I think I've phrased it just about the way I feel.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And the will includes","[INTERVIEWED]. What?","[INTERVIEWER1]. And the will includes -- -- demonstrations in the street? What form would you say","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I'm not about to get into proposing a three-point action plan for the people of Panama. All I want them to know is that if they get rid of Noriega they will have an instant normalization of relationship with the United States and there will be a useful role for the Panamanian Defense Force. And I think there has been some doubt about that, perhaps in the Panamanian Defense Force itself, as to how we now view the Force, because of the thuggery of its leader. And this gives me an opportunity to clarify that specific point, as well as to repeat my support for Endara and Calderon and Guillermo Ford, who was so brutally beaten.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you contemplating sending even more American troops down there now?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, if I were, it would be unlikely I would announce it here, just before landing in Starkville, only because I think it would be prudent to do it differently. But I'll answer your question, though: I have no short-run plans, but that doesn't preclude anything I'll do in the future.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You know Noriega. Is it strictly power that he wants or is there a point where he could be negotiated out?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know, Helen. I think it's power that he has wanted, but I don't know what his view is now that he's seen a total repudiation of his rule. And you see, I keep coming back to the fact that what happened the other day in the election is something quite different than has been on the table before. So, I just don't know the answer to it. It might be now he'd like to find a way to get out. I would hope that would be the case, but I don't know that for a fact. He has lost all support, all respect -- the man is considered just out of it, an outlaw, by the world community now as a result of what happened. But I don't know. It's a good question, yet I don't know how to answer. I don't have an answer for it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you saying that the United States at this juncture has, more or less, done what it could and that now what we're going to do is lend moral support to whatever the Panamanians decide? That we really can't from the outside do anything further?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, what I've said is that we've taken certain action to protect American lives. I have now spelled out, although I hope it had been understood before, what it would take to have good relations with the United States; and I will continue my own efforts internationally. You see, I do think it's important that it not be the United States, the Colossus of the North, coming down there to try to dictate to the people of Panama. And that's one of the reasons I spent a lot of time last week working with the international community and instructing the State Department to do the same thing. So, we will continue our international efforts.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you disappointed in the response to that of the PDF and some of the Panamanians to why you sent the troops down there? Are you disappointed in their response?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm not sure I know what their response has been. The PDF response?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes. I mean, you've come out here to clarify your views.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I'm not disappointed in the response. What I'm trying to do is make clear to the Panamanian Defense Forces that there's no vendetta against the Panamanian Defense Forces as an institution. There is clearly the desire to see Mr. Noriega get out of office. I don't know how they've reacted to the American forces.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], how long can the people of Panama be expected to put up with Noriega?","[INTERVIEWED]. About 4 days ago  when they demonstrated loud and clear they don't want any more. They've had it; and their will should be respected and honored. So, we've got to find a way to have that magnificent expression of democracy be honored.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are there certain things that you and the administration are sending them immediately, once Noriega leaves?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. We'd recognize immediately the Endara government. As soon as he's sworn in, we would return our Ambassador; we would remove our economic sanctions; we would, in essence, have normalized relations with a country for whom we have great affection and whose people have great affection for us.","If you talk to those two delegations that came back, both of them -- the liberal members of the delegation, the conservative members, the Republicans, the Democrats -- all of them certified, stipulated that the people of Panama have great affection for our country and for our people. So, you'd see an instant release of this oppression; and you'd see an effort by the United States to help Panama go down the road to democracy and to help them economically, as best we could, and to welcome them as they rejoin the family of democracies in this hemisphere. That would happen instantly. We wouldn't need a lot of delaying or thinking about it either. But it has to have the -- with that -- it's the departure of Noriega and the recognition of the people's will; those two have to go together.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Was there some development this morning or some intelligence that you got that caused this today?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, but I know because I was talking to General Scowcroft [Assistant to [INTERVIEWED] for National Security Affairs] yesterday and talked to Secretary [of State] Baker this morning. And I've had an uneasy feeling that perhaps what I've told you here today was not known clearly there. And it gives me a chance to -- well, the question as to how we view the Panamanian Defense Force itself, what would happen if Noriega left, vis-a-vis the United States of America, and I hope it's known that Endara","[INTERVIEWER1]. You think that","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think in a situation of this nature, where the head of the PDF has become such a pariah, that there perhaps -- been misunderstanding there as to how we view the institution itself and other of its officers. But if they come in there and Noriega goes and they respect the will of the people, I -- you know, we see a very useful role for the Panamanian Defense Force, in their own internal security and for their own -- any threat they might feel they had to the external security.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], has the PDF","[INTERVIEWED]. I really do have to go.","[INTERVIEWER1]. If the PDF asked for U.S. military help, how can we respond? What would we do?","[INTERVIEWED]. Asked for it to do what?","[INTERVIEWER1]. If they asked for military support -- if the PDF asks for military support from the United States.","[INTERVIEWED]. Support for what?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Military troops.","[INTERVIEWED]. For what purpose?","[INTERVIEWER1]. To move in on Noriega.","[INTERVIEWED]. If the PDF asks for support to get rid of Noriega, they wouldn't need support from the United States to get rid of Noriega. He's one man, and they have a well-trained force. That's my","[INTERVIEWER1]. What about if -- -- opposition asked for military support?","[INTERVIEWED]. I've outlined what we're doing. I've outlined what we're doing. I'd love to see this be resolved diplomatically. And when you have overwhelming world opinion on your side, maybe something is possible in the short-range future that has not been possible over the difficult past.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you still expect a smooth summit in terms of resolving the missile issue?","[INTERVIEWED]. We'll work it out.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This is Panama day.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, no, it's a good question. It will work out. This alliance is strong."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, it's progress. Great success happens when there's two states, living side by side in peace. And this is progress. I thought I would—since this is an historic trip, I thought I would just have you up and share thoughts and answer questions. We'll go around for a while.","First, I'm pleased with what happened yesterday and today. The first signs of peace happen when people make up their mind to work toward peace. And that's what you saw. You heard some pretty firm statements yesterday. The statements yesterday by the Arab leaders were very strong in public, and they were strong in private. One of the things that we have made clear to all parties is that there are terrorists who have to blow up the process—you all know that; it's been an historic fact—and that these countries in the neighborhood have the capacity to work to cut off money to the terrorist groups and access and arms deals. And they committed themselves to do that, which was a positive sign.","It was also important for Prime Minister Abbas to hear that. This is a man who is a newly elected Prime Minister, new to office. He gets sworn in, and the roadmap gets released. All of a sudden now he finds himself in a serious effort, the creation of a Palestinian state, which puts enormous responsibilities on him.","And one of the things we're saying is, you're now responsible. But it helped a lot to have the Arab leaders support him, and not only support him but to support him through pledges of activity and action. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia was particularly strong yesterday in private about the need to chase down terrorists. They've had some recent experience with terrorism. And I was really pleased with the strong commitment and the strong desire to not only deal with terrorists inside his country but to work to prevent arms being smuggled from—out of Iraq and into the territories.","We also spent a lot of time talking about Syria and the mutual concern about Syria and the desire to convince Syria to shut down terrorist offices inside—in Damascus. So there was a very helpful discussion. I think it was very helpful for Prime Minister Abbas to hear that.","Then we come to today. The way the day worked is that I met with the King of Jordan. He is a wonderful man. He is obviously desirous of Palestinian statehood, which would be very helpful to him. We talked about bilateral relations, economic— matters of economic development, and it was a good conversation.","And then I sat down with Prime Minister Sharon. I assured him that security was at the top of our agenda, like security is at the top of his agenda. One, we're in a war against terror, or a war against terror on the homefront; we're chasing down these people around. But we also recognize that there are some who would like to blow up the process and that we want to work to create the conditions for a Palestinian state to emerge, which means jointly working with all parties to work on the security issue.","I also told him, though, he's got responsibilities. The fact that he showed up meant that he believes Prime Minister Abbas can deliver. And therefore, we've got to work together to help the Prime Minister achieve his stated objectives, which, one, he had a very clear statement on terror. The other thing that was very interesting was his statement on incitement. And it was a fact statement, for those who follow the process. He needs time to get his security forces set up. And I reminded the Prime Minister—I also reminded him that I wasn't caught by surprise by his statement on the outposts, the issue of the outposts. He said he would dismantle them; we expect him now to dismantle them.","People say, \"Well, what's the first step?\" Well, you just heard the first step today in the speeches. And the—you also heard me say that we would help the Palestinian Authority develop a security force. Minister Dahlan will be in charge of that security force. We intend to work with them. We assured the Israelis we intend to work with them. We want this man to be successful. The Prime Minister absolutely rejected terror. In order for him to be effective in rejecting terror, he's got to have an effective security force. And so that's what we discussed.","And then we met, all of us together, our delegations. It was good. We had a— the discussion was very interesting is the Prime Minister asked members of his Knesset to speak, Minister of Defense, the Deputy Prime Minister, the equivalent of the Attorney General, Minister of Justice. And then Prime Minister Abbas spoke; I spoke.","And then I suggested that the three of us just go outside and visit, rather than having the formal settings of the old roundtable discussion. And so we went out and sat on the lawn there for about 30 minutes and discussed a lot of matters. What I wanted to do is to observe the interplay between the two; did they have the capacity to relax in each other's presence, for starters? And I felt they did. In other words, it was—the body language was positive. There wasn't a lot of hostility or suspicion.","There was a—it seemed like to me, from the conversation, that there was a mutual desire to work toward the vision. And obviously I'm not going to betray confidences, but it was a very interesting and positive conversation, is the best way to say it. I didn't need, for example, to be Mr. Chatty—you know, kind of, \"Hey, fellows.\" [Laughter] There was a natural tendency to want to talk about common matters and common desires.","And then after that, we gave our speeches, and here we sit. I will tell you that I'm pleased with the last 2 days. We have made a good beginning. And I emphasize beginning, because there's a lot of work to do. Let me just review some of the work that must take place. Obviously, there needs—there needs to be a focused, complete, 100-percent effort to fight off the terrorists. I believe the Palestinian—I know the Palestinian leadership wants that, has got that desire. And so, he must help them put the institutions in place to do that.","On the Palestinian side, there needs to be an emergence of a state, the institutions of which are larger than the participants. And that is essential. I assured the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority—and this was when we were sitting out on the lawn—that there is plenty of help coming. At the G-8 meeting in Evian, there was a lot of discussion about how we can help, \"What can we do?\" I said, \"Well, when the time is right, there's going to be need for money and commercial development and enhancement of the entrepreneurial spirit.\"","There's just a lot of things to be done— better education systems. Israel has got to recognize that Prime Minister Abbas is desirous for peace and, without compromising security, must make decisions necessary to help the Palestinian people. And they're doing that. Money is—more money is now in circulation. They collect revenues, Israel does, and now they're—they've got great trust in the Finance Minister of the Palestinian Authority, a guy who went to the University of Texas, by the way, for a while.","He came to Washington as an intermediary on behalf of Prime Minister Abbas, and Condi and I met with him in the Oval Office. I spent a lot of the time on Palestinian finances, cashflow matters, making sure that aid and money actually end up helping the people and not either bank accounts of individuals that—where it doesn't belong. I'm absolutely convinced he's an honest and upright man who believes in the future of the Palestinian people, believes that a democratic Palestinian state is possible.","It's important for Prime Minister Sharon to recognize that. I think he does. I'm confident he recognizes that. The $100 million that had been held in arrears was released, and the process of talking about more money going through, which—25,000 workers now that were not allowed in Israel now allowed in Israel. In other words, what I'm telling you is, is that it's important for the life of the Palestinians to improve in measurable ways.","And as confidence is built, as institutions are in place, I assured Prime Minister Abbas—and this was important for Prime Minister Sharon to hear as well—that there is going to be a lot of help, financial help, from around the world. People want this effort to succeed.","And so it's—it's a bit of—2 good days, but there's a lot to happen.","Let me just go around the table."," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. You sound cautious still.","[INTERVIEWED]. I am cautious, because— and I'm cautious because history tells you to be cautious. I don't know where you were in 2000. I guess it was—they were close. There are killers lurking in the neighborhood. There are people who have declared their—openly declared their hostility to Israel and their desire to destroy Israeli citizens. There are people that, you know, would rather have chaos than a state. And so long as you know they're there, you've got to be cautious.","And on the other hand, we've now got a partner in peace, Prime Minister Abbas, who is—wants the tools necessary to chase them down. It's going to be one of the accountability measures, by the way. That's one of reasons why we put Wolf.","The news today, of course, from our side was, besides having the meeting, was Ambassador John Wolf and his team. It's not just Wolf. It is not Wolf and one administrative assistant. It's Wolf and a team of people that the Secretary will be glad to explain to you. We have a security team there to help the Dahlan. Their job is to find out what's needed and to also hold people to account, both sides to account, reminding people of promises made in meetings and insisting them that in order for progress to be made, people have got to deliver it.","And so, yes, I've cautious, but optimistic. Perhaps we should say, cautiously optimistic. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], previous efforts at making peace in the Middle East did not succeed. You believe you now have a chance. Did you—and you also mentioned that it's historic—this was an historic meeting. Could you try to put this in history? What do you think has changed since you took office, and how did we get to this point?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think a couple of things have changed. One, I think there is—I think Prime Minister Abbas is willing to make the necessary decisions and take the necessary steps to fight terror and to develop institutions necessary for a state to emerge, a genuine effort. I believe he is, and that's a change.","Secondly, there is a universal recognition that the war on terror is just that, a war on terror and not empty words, that September the 11th or bombings in Riyadh or the terror that has plagued Israel, these are terrorist acts that must be defeated, and they must be defeated at its source as well. So there's a different—frankly, a different attitude toward terrorism. It's no longer isolated terrorism, it is terrorism that is beginning to affect a lot of people and can affect a lot of people. So in other words, the meeting yesterday, for example, with the Arab nations, it seemed like to me the new reality was reflected in their statements, which will make it easier for a Palestinian state to emerge. There's a vested interest to fight terror. It's people's self-interest now. And so I think that's been one of the changes.","I'm sure this is—other Presidents have said this; other leaders have—but there is now battle fatigue. People are sick and tired of it. People are sick and tired of the death, suffering, of the humiliation. In other words, there's—hopefully history will show whether or not I'm right, but hopefully we have reached the point where a lot of good people have begun to realize that the immediate past will lead to nothing but more suffering and humiliation and death. And people are beginning to change their attitudes on the ground.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think September 11th had an impact in the region, as well, in help-ing—did it just galvanize American views about terrorism, or did it also carry through into——","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it—the terror attacks shocked the world. And it frightened a lot of people, because they realized that if America can be hit, they could be hit. And then terror began to—I just said, the attacks in Riyadh or the attacks in Indonesia, Bali, a nice secure resort community. The next thing is, people wake up the next day and realize—around the world realize that there's no such thing as a nice, secure resort when we have terrorists willing to kill innocent lives in the numbers they did.","So not just September the 11th. September the 11th made the world aware of the new war. And then the other acts of terror that have taken place since made the issue come even closer to home for many countries. And then the combination of that plus the terrorist activities in the Palestinian territories and in Israel made people realize the effects of terror. It kind of brought it all home, I think. So, yes, I think September the 11th mattered, but it wasn't the only event that was—helped galvanize thought. People are frightened about terror in the Middle East, not just in Israel. And they've got to get after it.","And we're going to help them get after it. It's a part of this war. One of the hardest things I knew that I would have to do as [INTERVIEWED] is to remind the American people, and for that matter, people around the world, the nature of the war in which we find ourselves. And it's different. There's a couple battlefronts that are noticeable, Afghanistan and Iraq, but this war goes on. I mean, today, as we speak, we've got intelligence sharing going on, we've got people on the hunt trying to find them, one at a time. It's that same effort that will take place in the Palestinian territories, but it requires the desire by all leaders to want to fight it. I think that's changed some. I think it's changed a lot mentality.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you seem to value and even enjoy the spontaneity and informality that you brought in your meetings with these leaders. Could you dwell for a moment on your personal style of diplomacy and how you see it working?","[INTERVIEWED]. I try to tell the truth, put it right out there on the table for everybody to understand what's expected. I do; I like people.","You know, I remember, I think it was— Ron Fournier [Associated Press] asked me the question, \"Do you trust Vladimir Putin?\" It was one of the really interesting questions, to fire up [INTERVIEWED] standing next to Vladimir Putin. Well, the answer is yes, I didn't hesitate, because during my meeting with him, I had developed an interesting rapport. My instincts were such that, this is a guy I can trust. History will prove me right. It doesn't necessarily mean he has to agree with everything that I say, but trust his word.","I've spent enough time with Ariel Sharon to know he's the kind of guy when he says something, he means it. I'm getting the same sense about Prime Minister Abbas.","And therefore much of the conversations, particularly as I get to know somebody, is to figure out whether or not you can— whether or not, when they say something, they mean it. You can tell that, pretty much, during a conversation, which means trying to get people off their script, and as you discuss things, make it as informal as possible, because I think people in an informal setting tend to show their heart and/or their conscience in a lot better way.","I'm not a very formal guy to begin with. Condi and the Secretary of State, Colin, can give you a better sense of what my style is like. I'm also not very analytical. You know I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things. The meetings are informal; they're kind of relaxed. I think one of my styles is trying to relax people.","National Security Adviser Rice. Direct, I would say.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am a direct person. I mean, there's no—we don't have a lot of time, and therefore I like to get to the point. I like to ask people—I can challenge people. I believe I can do so in a way that's not offensive to them. It's about as encouraging as it was discouraging. And I hope they sense my sense of optimism. I mean, I'm an enthusiastic person when I believe that something is possible.","I believe peace is possible. I know it's going to be hard, but I think the fact that I'm representing a great country and am willing to sit down with these leaders and give them a sense, \"We're all in this together,\" is helpful. The best way to do that is in a more informal type setting where there's not a lot of prepared notes. I've been in meetings where people read speeches. It's not as productive as a meeting in which people can sit down and actually—one of my jobs is to try to help relax people in a setting. I hope I'm pretty good at that. How do you feel? Do you feel relaxed right now?","[INTERVIEWER1]. More relaxed than I should.","[INTERVIEWED]. It worked.","Meeting With Arab Leaders","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that what happened when you were in the the anteroom with the Arab leaders, you just decided that it was a more relaxed setting and that you prefer to keep talking——","[INTERVIEWED]. Exactly, yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Could you tell us a little bit about that meeting and what went on in that meeting?","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure, I'd love to. First of all, I understand that there was a little bit of hard feelings. I was told last night about certain press wasn't in. We had no idea. I'm available for any photo op. [Laughter] But it was not an intention, if that's—that's the meeting I think you're talking about, the informal meeting.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Multilateral. But we'd like to know what happened in the private meeting that you had with the heads of state before you came out.","[INTERVIEWED]. Before we came out, the thing that was not supposed to be on TV, that one. It was just a roundtable discussion about—let me make sure I get it right here. I told them, I said, look—all four of those leaders, except for Prime Minister Abbas, were—Prime Minister Abbas was there. The other four leaders are leaders who I obviously talked to during the Iraq war. Before the Iraq war and after the Iraq war, I assured them that I was going to be involved in moving the Middle East peace process forward, particularly after the emergence of the Prime Minister, Abbas.","This was my chance to go around the table and look him in the eye and say, \"I'm here to make it happen, but I need your help.\" The first thing was to—is to let them know about the intent of this administration. I shared with them—well, you know Colin's involvement and Condi's involvement. I didn't share with them the Wolf—I knew they would read about it today. There wasn't any great secret. On the other hand, you occasionally try to hold back some news—you've probably learned it before I did, anyway.","And then we listened to them, and Crown Prince Abdullah. And they had a lot of interesting thoughts about different issues. Oh, and by the way, it wasn't just— the discussion wasn't just on the Middle East peace process. The other thing I told them, I asked them, was to help Prime Minister Abbas. I directly said, \"We need your help on this fellow. If he is to succeed, if peace is to succeed, he needs your help.\" And they were willing; they expressed their desire to help. And I went to Iraq and talked about what was happening there.","Then I encouraged them to continue on their paths to reform and about how that would make a significant difference in the lives of their citizens. So it was more than—and they commented on all that, different aspects. I'm not going to tell you what they told me. If they want to tell you what—if they want to say what is theirs, they'll put it in their own press. It was a long discussion. It took a lot longer than we thought.","And part of it had to do because a lot of it needed to be translated. Therefore, a normal conversation—all of it had to be translated. The Crown Prince does not speak English very well, so therefore every word that was spoken had to volleyed. And so that's—we had a good conversation, again, not structured. People said what they felt like, and there was no—it wasn't just, \"Okay, you speak; you speak; you speak, and then we're through.\" There was a lot of interchange. That's positive.","And I met bilaterally with them as well. I met with—Colin and Condi and I went over to President Mubarak's house that night. We had a bilateral with him in the morning, and afterwards we ate. I had a bilateral with the Crown Prince at the hotel after the sauna bath.","It was very hot outside when I spoke. [Laughter] Thank you for clarification. It was hot. I'm sweating. I was really hot.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know, I know there was one place where you were talking about it, figuratively——","[INTERVIEWED]. Figuratively, that's right. Just to see if you were paying attention. And it's very useful to have those kind of conversations.","Palestinian Authority Leadership","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], a big part of why you were here, and you made clear, is because Mahmoud Abbas is the person who is Palestinian Prime Minister, and Yasser Arafat is not the person who you chose to negotiate. But Palestinian leaders, some of their senior officials, made clear that they still think Yasser Arafat—they made clear that they still think Yasser Arafat is somebody who needs to be dealt with, who needs to negotiate. I'm wondering what kinds of conversations you had with the Arab leaders and maybe with Mahmoud Abbas about Arafat's role?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's clear that I'm going to deal with Prime Minister Abbas, so there wasn't much conversation.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it will come up?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not really. The Secretary of State is——","Secretary Powell. It didn't come up in any of the conversations with [INTERVIEWED] that I'm aware of. And they know our views on this.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have any concern that he might be a hindrance to the process at all?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not if he has the Palestinian people's interests at heart. We'll see. I certainly hope not.","Secretary Powell. Can I just——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, please.","Secretary Powell. In conversations with the Arab leaders, particularly the Foreign Ministers, we made it clear to them that one of the things we expected them to help with was to make sure that Mr. Arafat does not become an obstacle to the execution of the roadmap.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Did they seem to say that they were willing to do that?","Secretary Powell. They understood. They will help.","[INTERVIEWED]. I think they understand.","Secretary Powell's Role","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. It really didn't—I mean, he's handled most of that. It did not come up during my conversations with the Arab leaders. What came up was, how do we help Prime Minister Abbas? Now, Colin may have had different—with the Foreign Ministers, since they have some frank discussions. A lot of times you'll find out that the underbrush has been cleared by the— and by the time [INTERVIEWED] arrives, everybody kind of understands. And one of his jobs is to clear out underbrush. That's an old ranch term. [Laughter] In other words—I don't know what he told the Foreign Ministers, but I just heard what he told the Foreign Ministers.","[INTERVIEWER1]. He's watching the calluses on his hands.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that's it. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you, just a followup?","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","Red Sea Summit","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you consider sort of the importance of the role of [INTERVIEWED] in this kind of process? For example, this is the first time—it's been 2 1/2 years since you've been President. It's the first time you've had this kind of summit, where some of your predecessors had multiple summits by this time.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, first of all, we've had a lot of meetings but not summits. I've had a lot of discussions with every one of the parties that have been around the table, with the exception of Prime Minister Abbas, and he's just showed up. He just emerged as a leader. I called him immediately upon—I think immediately or soon after he became Prime Minister.","I mean, so—let me—just because we haven't had the summit doesn't mean this administration hasn't been working toward achieving the conditions necessary to move forward. And that's really an important— there has to be—I can remember saying this to the press corps early on in my administration. People want to have to— peace, want peace. In order to move the process forward requires a—there's no need to spend capital and energy and time if there is not a commitment to peace. And the conditions are such now that there is a commitment to peace by a lot of people that are ready to see if we can't make it happen. That's what's changed.","And therefore the timing of this summit was really based upon the attitudes of the decisionmakers. We're not the decision-maker. Oh, the American President or the American Secretary of State is—I wish we were the decisionmakers. You know, \"Okay, this is it.\" That's not the way it works. There's terrorists to deal with. If we could, we'd say, \"All the terrorists, put down your arms and become useful citizens, peaceful citizens.\" But that's not, unfortunately, reality.","Banding together, though, we can deal with the ticket—you know, build up the will necessary to deal with the terrorists. And so what the role of the United States is, is to lay out the vision, encourage people to accept the vision, and then help implement the vision. In this case, we call it a roadmap to achieve the vision. And that's exactly what we're going to do. We can be stewards of accountability. And we can say to somebody, \"You said you'd do this. You haven't done it. You say you want to do this, and what do you need to get it done?\"","So today we asked Dahlan, \"What is it you need? How can we help you? This is a security matter. What exactly can we do to help?\"","Secretary Powell. [INTERVIEWED], can I give four data points to show [INTERVIEWED]'s involvement? Just a couple of quick data points to show you how we got here and how [INTERVIEWED] caused us to be here. Twenty-four June speech you're very familiar with. On the 18th of July, [INTERVIEWED] had Arab Foreign Ministers in the Oval Office—Muasher of Jordan, Saud of Saudi Arabia, Maher of Egypt. And at that meeting, [INTERVIEWED] said to them, we will now structure a way to go from my vision to reality. And that was the beginning of the work on the roadmap.","Work went on all summer, all fall. And then on the 20th of December, the European—the Quartet came together to finalize it. [INTERVIEWED] met with the Quartet, finalized it, and then we waited for the Israeli elections to be over, which were just about finished at that time, and then we said, with the appointment of new leadership in the Palestinian Authority, [INTERVIEWED] is ready to act, and he did.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], in the events of the last 2 days, have they exceeded what you expected coming over here?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's a good question. I'm supposed to say—that's an interesting question. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. You're supposed to say what you think.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm the master of low expectations. I think they—we did what we wanted to—I think we—we accomplished what I hoped we would accomplish, but I don't think we necessarily exceeded expectations. I think \"met expectations\" is a better way to put it.","I was hoping to have honest dialogs. The statements that came out—I think when you analyze the statements, you'll find them to be historic, I guess is the right word to use. Amazing things were said. The Palestinian—the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority talked about the suffering of Jewish people. It's a strong statement. The Prime Minister of Israel talked about a Palestinian state which was free. The statements were strong.","It's hard to answer, exceeded expectations. I had a little bit of an understanding of what might take place, because we worked hard. These trips, obviously, don't just happen. The statement just doesn't show up out of the blue. It requires— [laughter]——","National Security Adviser Rice. Oh, no, they just appeared magically.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm a great delegator; I'm a great delegator. And so they met expectations. However, the cordial atmosphere— I'll tell you what else was interesting, that I would say met expectations or was pleasing to see, was the interface between the Palestinian Cabinet and the Israeli Cabinet. When we went out to sit on the grounds— and I witnessed some of it but not all of it since I was actually on the grounds— Colin and Condi told me that there was very interesting discussions and dialog going on. There was—people were frank with each other. They were able to joke with each other. They were able to kind of bring up a little history with each other.","But the main thing that came out of it, at least to our delegation, appeared to be the desire to work together. You two witnesses, maybe you want to——","National Security Adviser Rice. That's absolutely the case.","Preparations for the Red Sea Summit","[INTERVIEWER1]. If I could follow up, [INTERVIEWED], were there any time going into this that you were hearing things, that you were thinking to yourself, uh-oh——","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I wasn't going if we weren't going to make progress. I mean, there's no need to go and stand up there by myself and say, \"Let's work for peace,\" and look around, and nobody would be there with you. So I was—I think there were some times where—we've had some—in the runup to the process, there was some—there was a lot of work, let me put it to you that way, and a lot of frank discussion and a lot of convincing of parties that we need to get on this path, and we need to work hard, and we need to make commitments. The speeches that— there were some commitments made in those speeches which now put people on the record, not only on the record, all across the world. I mean, a lot of people were watching this today. And I guess it was live in America. So you had these leaders stand up and say, \"I commit\"—not just commit to—I mean, the Prime Minister of Israel saying, \"I commit to knock down or get rid of illegal outposts.\" That is a strong commitment.","So the process was really to work hard to get people to make commitments toward peace. And Condi's staff and Colin's staff worked very closely together. And Colin went out to the region, as you may remember. Part of what you saw today was his hard work. They always look at [INTERVIEWED], but the truth of the matter is that there have been a lot of people working hard to work with all parties to get to where we got today. I just happen to attract more cameras than most of them. So I stand up there, and everybody watches.","National Security Adviser Rice. We actually had a team in the region for almost a week, Bill Burns and Elliot Abrams for almost a week.","[INTERVIEWED]. Elliot Abrams is her staff. Bill, of course, is an Under Secretary.","Secretary Powell. Assistant Secretary.","[INTERVIEWED]. Runs the NEA, is very capable. And then of course we—we had to make the decision on the man who is going to run the deal on the ground and how his team was going to be formed. Again, the Secretary had to move him in his Department and had to come up with the right structure and the right people so that when the Palestinians and Israelis see who was sitting out there and what they represent, they realize that it's serious business. All that took a while to get to where we are.","To answer your question, I'm pleased with the start, is the best way to put it. I mean, this—we are going to go through a tough process, because we're dealing with a lot of history. And you're right, a lot of Presidents have tried. Every President should try. We ought to use the prestige of America to try for peace. I fault no President of the United States for trying to achieve peace. Maybe history is such that now we can achieve it. I'm optimistic.","Israeli Security/War on Terror","[INTERVIEWER1]. You were pretty blunt yesterday that Israel must deal with the settlements.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sharon made—I don't think we were supposed to hear that. Sharon made his pledge today. If there's a suicide bombing, does he reserve the right to move back into those settlements?","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I think the operative statement from the Israeli Prime Minister, not necessarily in this speech but recently, was he wants to see a complete effort to fight off terror. In other words, he wants an equal partner. He wants a partner in the battle on terror, not somebody who will say they're going to fight terror and then turn a blind eye to terror, somebody who wants to join him. And that's one of the things that came clear. It should have been clear in my speech, too, that we will fight terror.","And security is—we'll never compromise on Israel's security. That's one of the reasons why I believe the Israeli Knesset members over there, the Prime Minister, wants to follow us, work with us, because they know I will never compromise Israel's security. And I've made that clear. As Condi said, one of the things about our discussions, they're frank. There's no question in the Palestinian Authority's mind, either, I can assure you.","Now having—so therefore—what the Prime Minister of Israel has said is, he expects to see a complete effort by the Palestinian Authority to fight off terror. Prime Minister Abbas said today in his statement, there is no place for terror. And he is going to put together a security forces necessary fight off the terrorists, because he knows that there will be no state if terror prevails. And he knows his people will suffer. The terrorists think they're hurting Israel, and they are when they kill Israelis. But they're also hurting their own people, and Prime Minister Abbas understands that.","Plus the people in the region know what terror now means. They've lived with terror in the region, but they've now begun to put it in context. And that's—I'm trying to put it as clearly as I can. The context of terror now has changed. The death hasn't changed, but it's now—it's easier for everybody to see how it fits into a larger scheme of things. And the larger scheme of things is the war on terror, because it's beginning to strike in lethal ways in unexpected places, which therefore means that your place could be next, I guess is one way to put it.","President's Role in the Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER1]. What's your role? What do you do? You talked about giving the Secretary and Dr. Rice specific obligations. What's your obligation?","[INTERVIEWED]. I show up when they need me to call people to account, to praise, or to say, \"Wait a minute. You told me in Jordan that you would do this. You haven't done it, why? How come? What is it?\" It's to keep the thing moving, keep the processes moving. They've got the man on the ground that is going to—he's just going to—I used the expression \"ride herd.\" I don't know if anybody understood the meaning. It's a little informal in diplomatic terms. I said, \"We're going to put a guy on the ground to ride herd on the process.\" See them all scratching their heads.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Meanwhile, in Arabic and Hebrew, exactly how does that translate?","[INTERVIEWED]. Listen, I've got to make a phone call, but I want to thank you all for your interest. It's been a great trip. Have a good day tomorrow, and then we'll get to go home. I'm looking forward to it, looking forward to getting to see my family.","Summit Photograph","[INTERVIEWER1]. What happened when you—the three of you walked out for the photograph, and did you hear the Israeli photographer screaming, \"Are you going to shake hands?\" Did you hear that?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. Where was it?","[INTERVIEWER1]. It was the photographer screaming——","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, yes. How do you shake hands with three people? I couldn't understand—first of all, I had a little trouble hearing. My hearing is not as good as it used to be, and then sometimes I don't want to hear anything to begin with, like the questions you yell. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, it was a pleasure to talk to you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, thanks for coming over.","NOTE: [INTERVIEWED] spoke at 4:40 p.m. aboard Air Force One en route to Doha, Qatar. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Minister of State for Security Affairs Mohammed Dahlan, and Finance Minister Salam Fayyad of the Palestinian Authority; Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, and Justice Minister Tommy Lapid of Israel; Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; King Abdullah II of Jordan; Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation John S. Wolf; and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell referred to Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher of Jordan; Foreign Minister Saud al-Faysal al Saud of Saudi Arabia; and Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher of Egypt. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice referred to William J. Burns, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs; and Elliot Abrams, National Security Council Senior Director for Near East, Southwest Asian, and North African Affairs. A reporter referred to Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this interview.","George W. Bush, Interview With Members of the White House Press Pool Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/215704"]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspool0","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. What I thought I would do is just——","[INTERVIEWER1]. On the record?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, on the record. I thought I would just give you some observations of this trip and then answer some questions. Just first observation is that we have worked hard to build up good bilateral relations in the Far East. And the—part of the purpose of the trip is to continue to foster those relations.","It struck me as interesting that the United States now has got good enough relations with both—with countries like Japan and South Korea and China to effect policy which helps our mutual security and our economy—and economy. I think that's a very positive development.","The most notable example of where that is taking—where it is helping is in North Korea. When I visited with Hu Jintao, I spent a lot of time talking about North Korea, our mutual desire to effect change with Kim Chong-il. And it was a very positive discussion. But I also had the very same discussion with Koizumi and President Roh. I mentioned it to Vladimir. I didn't have a bilateral with Vladimir Putin, but I did talk to him about it in passing.","My point is, is that by working hard to establish good relations on a lot of fronts, when a common problem arises, we can effect the solution in a positive way. I know you asked me, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters], about the North Korean reaction. I didn't exactly see what official said it. But I—what I hope my answer conveyed to you in public there was that this requires a degree of patience, because Kim Chong-il is used to being able to deal bilaterally with the United States. But the change of policy now is, is that he must deal with other nations, most notably China. And I was pleased with my discussions with Hu Jintao, about his—reaffirming his mutual desire—or his desire, which is our mutual goal, that Kim Chong-il disarm. He realizes that it's a problem.","We discussed the security guarantees, what form they may come in. I made it very clear, obviously—I said this during the pool spray there—that a treaty is not going to happen, but there are other ways to effect on paper what I have said publicly— we have no intention of invading. Obviously, any guarantee would be conditional on Kim Chong-il doing what he hopefully will say he'll do, which is to get rid of his nuclear weapons programs.","The APEC summit was positive. I mean, one of the things that's very important— the two things that came out of that, although evidently didn't get equal emphasis, but they were equally emphasized by all parties, was, one, the need to get the Doha Round of trade going again. This was really one of the first official meetings of a group of countries after the Cancun talks broke down. And there was a positive statement coming out of the meeting, kind of universal agreement that Cancun was a missed opportunity. Hopefully the missed opportunity will be—will serve as a catalyst. I think people now have taken a step back and said, \"Well, we did miss an opportunity,\" and hopefully this will enable the talks—kind of not start at ground zero but have a running start as a result of the missed opportunity.","And it's interesting, in the room there is something like 60 percent of all the world trade—was affected—was countries in that room, and therefore it was a, I think, a very positive and strong statement.","The other thing was the clear understanding of the countries of the need to fight terror. That's important for the United States, that people continue to recognize that the war on terror goes on. I've always felt that there's a tendency for people to kind of seek a comfort zone and hope that the war on terror is over. And I view it as a responsibility of the United States to remind people of our mutual obligations to deal with the terrorists.","That notion of responsible behavior by countries was finally accepted. This was not a—didn't require a lot of push. People understood. President Megawati understands that when terrorists bomb Bali, it affects economies. It not only—there's a serious economic consequence, same thing we felt on September the 11th, to our economy.","That was a very positive development. Bilateral discussion with all the leaders— in those bilateral discussions, we talked about this war on terror. Gloria Arroyo, with Abu Sayyaf, President Megawati just hours ago, we talked about the continued need for us to work together.","I think the other notable—when you step back and take a look at what our work with these Asian countries has been, they understand the Iraq issue well. South Korea was very forthcoming. Japan is forthcoming. Hu Jintao made it clear that he—that a peaceful Iraq was in the world interest. Those are all positive developments in kind of the aftermath of the military operation. And I think it speaks to our—the nature of our relationship with these countries right now.","Obviously we haven't been to Australia, but Australia is a key component in a peaceful Asia-Pacific region and a key partner in the war on terror. So I'm looking forward to seeing John Howard. He and I have got a great relationship. He is a— as I said in Crawford, he's a man of steel. He's a standup guy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A sheriff?","[INTERVIEWED]. He's a sheriff. See, that's a good lesson. You should never answer the question you're asked. [Laughter] Actually, I answered it for a reason. Of all the people in the world who understand Texas, it's probably Australians.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Patsy [Patricia Wilson, Reuters].","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, Patsy. Anyway, it's going to be a good visit down there. We had some good discussions there at APEC, but this will be a chance to further our discussions and assure the Australian people that the American people are really grateful for the support and mutual efforts to make the world secure.","I had a good visit with the religious leaders today. It was an important visit. There were three Muslims, a Christian, and a Hindu. A couple of observations from the meeting: One, there was kind of a sense that Americans believe that Muslims are terrorists. And one of the reasons I wanted to have this meeting was because I wanted to make it very clear that I didn't feel that way and Americans don't feel that way. And I made it—assured them that Americans know that these terrorists are hiding behind Islam in order to create fear and chaos and death.","Secondly, there was a—they did bring up the Middle East. I explained to them what our policy was, that in order for there to be a Palestinian state—and I reminded them I was the first President to have articulated that—that there needs to be a concerted effort to fight off the terrorists who are trying to prevent the establishment of a state. I didn't really have time to go in further than that, about the whole Aqaba accords and the progress we were making, until the Prime Minister, who had avowed—who vowed to fight terror with us, was eased out.","Let's see, what else did they discuss? Iraq, of course. I assured them that we would do our job, and then the Iraqis will run themselves, and that our job means to provide enough security so that the Iraqi citizens are able to write a constitution and hold elections, at which point the United States and the coalition forces will move on. And I think they were pleased to hear it. I don't want to put words in their mouth, but I think that relieved them to know that we have confidence in the Iraqi people's abilities to be a peaceful, free society.","National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. You listened.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, they did a lot of talking.","National Security Adviser Rice. They had a lot to say.","[INTERVIEWED]. They had some prepared texts. There was a good exchange. I'm glad I did it. They were, I think, appreciative of the fact I took time to listen to them and dispel some notions and to—my own personal views about religion and the views of our country. I reminded them, we've got a lot of Muslims living in the United States, and they make an important contribution to our country, and they're welcome in the United States. And we're a pluralistic, free society; people can worship the way they want to worship. And it works well in America.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Was it confrontational at all?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not at all, polite.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You said that there were some texts. Did they come out with the line about— what did they tell you? How direct were they? They said some things going into the meeting that the United States policy is tilted against Muslims. What did they——","[INTERVIEWED]. They said the United States policy is tilted toward Israel, and I said our policy is tilted toward peace and that—and then I went through the notion of a Palestinian state and the need for us to fight off terror in order for a state to develop.","There wasn't a lot of debate. There were five people there that felt—that all needed to say something. So I gave them all a time to speak, and I listened and would occasionally interject some thoughts about what they had said. But they were direct. One fellow felt that the war on Iraq was— I guess the best way to put it was maybe just—I can't remember his exact words, but it was like we just decided to act. And I reminded him that the world had spoken before, that there was a—the United States had passed—I didn't get into all the resolutions, but I made it clear that a process had gone on way before I made the decision to use military force, that the world had spoken before about Saddam Hussein.","I also made the point very clearly that there was a lot of human suffering; a lot of Muslims suffered in Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. And I did bring up the mass graves and the torture rooms and the rape rooms and the death at the hands of Saddam Hussein. My point to them was, was that we ended a lot of suffering, prevented a lot of suffering.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is your job made tougher in convincing them that Americans don't have a war on—don't dislike Islam when you have General Boykin saying that Muslims all——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that came up. Boykin came up. I said he didn't reflect my opinion. Look, it just doesn't reflect what the Government thinks. And I think they were pleased to hear that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Something in your answer to your Terry's [Terence Hunt, Associated Press] question was interesting. You articulated the fact that you're [INTERVIEWED]—first President to advocate a Palestinian state. And obviously in trying to reassure Muslims——","[INTERVIEWED]. Not that good a question. Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——not only in America but around the world, potential terrorist hotbeds—to reassure people who are interested in this subject of that point. It's not something we have heard you saying a lot lately. Is there a reason——","[INTERVIEWED]. About a Palestinian state?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right, that you were the first President to advocate it.","[INTERVIEWED]. I say it quite a bit. I mean, I really do. First of all, in America, most people know that. In Indonesia, maybe they didn't pay attention to it. But anyway, I explained it. It was not a—I don't view that as—I wouldn't read anything into that, I had to say that in Indonesia, but not saying it in every press conference I give.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you about some of the leaders you've met with here?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, anyway——","[INTERVIEWER1]. I guess what I'm getting at is, it's a good thing to have out there, I guess. We don't hear it a lot.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I don't know. There's a lot of things that there's misconceptions. Evidently it's a misconceptions that Americans believe that Muslims are terrorists. And there was a—that's probably one of the best things that came out of the meeting, for me, was to have heard that concern, and for me being able to assure people and remind them about the nature of our society, that—and that Islam's a peaceful religion. The basic tenets of Islam is peace and respect and tolerance. And that's what they wanted to make the point to me, that we are—that's the way we are.","Interesting, their elections came up. This is the first direct Presidential election. It's going to be interesting—an interesting exercise in democracy. And they wanted to talk about that. And as you know—maybe you don't know—our USAID money is helping with the elections. They were appreciative of that. The education money came up. They wanted to make sure that this wasn't America's education system. I said, \"It's not. It's money available for the Indonesian Government to help basic education develop.\" So those were a couple of misconceptions that it was important for me to help alter.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask a question—I know that you say campaigning—there will be time enough for campaigning. In just months, Democrats, at least, will be fighting in some very highly contested—what do you say to those who are criticizing your policy? Where does the line end where they've got to be very careful to not undermine American foreign policy?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know. You know, I'm not paying that much attention to it. Maybe you are. I'm not. You know, one of these days, they'll have a candidate, and then it will all sort out, kind of come in focus. Primarily—I don't know what they're saying, so it's hard for me to answer that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Democrats who are criticizing your policy now, some of them fairly severely, about the war, does that hurt when you go to meet with these foreign leaders? Does that have any resonance?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, I can't—I don't know, because they have never brought it up. Nobody has ever said, \"Your foreign policy is being challenged in Democrat primaries, and therefore you're less credible.\" I mean, it really hasn't come up. I think most people who understand America know that the field will eventually be whittled down to one opponent, and then we'll campaign.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You seem, on these trips in particular, to bond with some of these leaders who have taken on very difficult problems at home, sort of stuck their neck out, whether it's President Arroyo or—you had some of those comments about the King of Jordan when he came. And I was just wondering, do you relate to that at all, particularly in having to take on the war on terrorism and kind of not, as you say, wanting to be too comfortable and pretend that it's over?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, that's an interesting question. First of all, I like people. And I spend time trying to—I think about the other person and how the other person might think and relate to the other person's problems. I do have good relations with these leaders on an individual basis, for a variety of reasons. I mean, Gloria Arroyo, who is taking a tough stand against Abu Sayyaf, there is a common bond there because she has made some tough decisions. But these leaders—for example, Aznar of Spain or Blair of Britain, these guys stood up, stood strong and were—did what they thought was right. That's my approach.","I remember when we had the discussion down in Crawford, one of reporters, fellow reporters, said, \"I hear you don't pay attention to the press.\" I said, \"Not really.\" And he said, \"Why?\" And I said, \"Well, because sometimes your opinion matters to me and sometimes it doesn't, but I've got a job, and I'm willing to lead.\" And the fellow said, \"Well, how do you know what the people think?\" And I said, \"Well\"—I reminded the fellow that people don't make up their mind based upon what they write, and secondly, my job is to lead. My job is to do what I think is the right thing and lead.","And I think those world leaders appreciate that, and I appreciate that when I see that they make those tough decisions. There is a common bond that's established when you're in the decisionmaking process and you're not trying to chase popular will, which is fickle and moves around. You stay focused on the objectives you set for a country. That's a very good question. It may be an area where we do establish in common.","And I've reminded them at times that, just do what you think is right, stand your ground in the face of public criticism, and the people—when things turn out the way—for the good, people will judge you correctly.","Dana [Dana Bash, Cable News Network], how are you?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I'm well, thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Are you surviving this trip?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I wish we just got a little more time in Bali.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that and Hawaii. Look, I've heard all the people——","[INTERVIEWER1]. She spent her honeymoon in Bali.","[INTERVIEWED]. You'll be thankful when we get back. You'll be grumpy—very grumpy, starting tomorrow, when we get airborne. But you'll be thankful when we all land home.","Reform of the Palestinian Authority","[INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, I was wondering, the last time we sat around this table was coming from Aqaba.","[INTERVIEWED]. Middle East, that's right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And you were talking about how positive you felt about Prime Minister Abbas and the fact that you thought that things would be able to move forward.","[INTERVIEWED]. And they did move forward, for a while.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I wonder if you could reflect on how you felt since—during the fact that the man you put confidence in and hope in is gone.","[INTERVIEWED]. I was disappointed that Arafat shoved him out of the way. I just— it was an unfortunate decision, because it stopped good progress toward a Palestinian state. And when the Palestinian Authority comes up with a leader who is willing to genuinely fight and dismantle terrorist organizations, the process will pick up where it left off and move forward.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you confident of that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I hope it does. I think eventually it will. You've got to be patient in foreign policy sometimes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is there anything more the United States can do on that, or is the roadmap— once they get on track on the roadmap, then things will come back and move forward again?","[INTERVIEWED]. The roadmap is still there. And we just need leadership willing to stand up and say, \"We're going to prevent the few from letting the process move forward.\" And that's what they're doing. There are a few people there that don't want a Palestinian state. They've got different ambitions. And we've just got to fight them off.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think the public support of the U.S. for Abbas sort of got Arafat to dig in his heels?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know. I really don't. I can't speculate as to why the decision was made. This was an unfortunate decision, because it delayed the development of a Palestinian state.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What did you tell Prime Minister Mahathir? Apparently he's saying you didn't fuss at him.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I walked up and said, the—I said, \"I want to inform you that you're going to read the newspapers\"— Condi had briefed the press about me saying that the comments were reprehensible. I said, \"You're going to see—I'm here to inform you that you're going to see that I thought your comments were reprehensible.\" I said, \"They're divisive and unnecessary.\" I didn't yell at him. I just told him—confirmed exactly what was in the newspaper.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How did he respond?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes, what did he say?","[INTERVIEWED]. \"I was misquoted\" or something. I can't remember exactly what he said, but I just had—that was it. You know the way I felt.","[INTERVIEWER1]. He said he was misquoted?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, he said he was——","[INTERVIEWER1]. Taken out of context?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, context, whatever he said to you all.","Press Secretary Scott McClellan. He said that in the paper.","[INTERVIEWED]. Not misquoted. It's hard to misquote what he said.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The issue were his comments. Obviously he's on his way out, but the response, apparently, at the Islamic conference, was a round of applause. What do you make of that?","[INTERVIEWED]. It's just unfortunate, again. I mean, it's one of these situations where in order to achieve peace and freedom, you can't pit groups against each other. And there's a tendency to blame Jewish people. And that's not the policy— that's not how I think, and that's not the policy of the United States Government. I wasn't there, so I don't—pitting groups against each other will never achieve a common objective. It does quite the opposite. He knew how I felt. There's no question about that. I don't know, what did he say?","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]—he was asking Muslims to have more understanding, at one part——","[INTERVIEWED]. Evidently, in his speech, he said that we need more education, a terrorist ban, which is good. That was positive.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I know you hate two questions, but I can just—just two quick ones. You talked about your meeting with Hu, and that was positive. Is there anything that he offered to you that he can—any pressure he can apply on North Korea? And the second one is a brief one. Are you happy with the progress or the contributions with the Madrid donors' conference coming up?","[INTERVIEWED]. Donors' conference? Yes. I think we're making good progress. And the question on Hu was?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is there anything that he can—any pressure that he can apply on North Korea? Did he say he would be able to do anything or——","[INTERVIEWED]. He is a—China is a major presence in the neighborhood. And the fact that they're willing to take the same message to the North Koreans that the United States is taking to the North Koreans, along with three other nations, is a powerful statement to Kim Chong-il that it's in his national interest that he abandon his nuclear weapons ambitions and that—he has been saying—as I said in the press conference, I think—one of your questions— he's been saying, \"I want a security guarantee.\" And what we have now said is that in return for dismantling the programs, we're all willing to sign some kind of document, not a treaty but a piece of paper that says we won't attack you. We'll see what happens.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How does that—a lot of people were saying we can't make it look like we're giving in to blackmail from North Korea.","[INTERVIEWED]. What's changed is we've now got five countries involved. And the neighborhood is now speaking. What happened before was the bilateral relations with the United States. And now he's got his big neighbor to the—right on his border, he's got a neighbor to the south, he's got Japan, he's got another neighbor, Russia, all saying the same thing. It's a different dynamic, is what I'm—that's where the policy has changed.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This security guarantee, what should it say?","[INTERVIEWED]. That's what we'll determine. We haven't worked out the words, but the point is, is that North Korea must hear that in return for the dismantling of their program—in a verifiable way, by the way; I mean, we're going to want to know—that now five nations are willing to say something about his security.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Everybody is behind that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask you one on Iran?","[INTERVIEWED]. On Iran? Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. It seems like last night there was some maybe cautious optimism that this is a good first step. If they comply with the three criteria that you've laid out, would they be then allowed to have a civilian nuclear energy program, or would that——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it depends on—first things first, and that is, let us have, in a verifiable way, their agreement that was made with the IAEA. The IAEA must be allowed in, and we'll discuss it then. Our relations with Iran—that will help relations with Iran, obviously, if they do abandon a nuclear weapons program. It will also help if they—we end up doing a—reaching an agreement on the Al Qaida that they hold.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What are the cross-strings there?","[INTERVIEWED]. You've got to have patience in foreign policy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all suspicious of the European motives?","[INTERVIEWED]. Am I suspicious? No, not in this case. No, I'm not. I believe, in this case, they generally are concerned about Iran developing a nuclear weapon. They understand the consequences. I appreciate it very much. We spent a lot of time talking to the European—our European counterparts, who are influential, more so than we are, in Iran. You know, we've got a sanctions policy with Iran; they don't. And there's influence. This is an effective approach. I've been saying all along that not every policy issue needs to be dealt with by force. There are ways to achieve common objectives, and this is a common objective.","And the European Union—and we're speaking directly to Silvio Berlusconi about it, who is the head of the EU. We've also obviously spoke to the three—the leaders of the countries who went into Iran. And they made a decision collectively in Europe that it's not in their interest or the world interest that Iran have a nuclear weapon. And we came to that conclusion, they've come to that conclusion, and working together is an effective way. It's the same approach—kind of approach we're taking in North Korea as well, a collective voice trying to convince a leader to change behavior.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]—Republicans in Congress didn't follow your wishes on the phone——","[INTERVIEWED]. I thought they did in the House. There's two bodies.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you regret saying that you loathe Kim Chong-il? Some people think that it helped them sort of—it made them sort of harden their position——","[INTERVIEWED]. Any leader who starves his—made him do what?","[INTERVIEWER1]. It just made him——","[INTERVIEWED]. Made Kim Chong-il— surely it didn't make Kim Chong-il renege on the last agreement, did it? Because I wasn't there, you know what I'm saying?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right, but they've been much more vocal about their nuclear ambitions.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, they've been—remember, they lobbed a rocket over——","[INTERVIEWER1]. Japan.","[INTERVIEWED]. Remember the rocket over Japan? Keep it in perspective. Anybody who starves his people is—I just can't respect anybody that would really let his people starve and shrink in size as a result of malnutrition. It's a sad, sad situation for the North Korean people. That's one people—I've assured the—our partners in this effort that we deeply care about the plight of the North Korean people. It's just unconscionable that that many people are starving in the 21st century. We provide— we're a generous nation. We provided food. We're not so sure the food is getting to the people, is one of the issues that we face. I feel strongly about failed leadership dashing the hopes of the people, in this case creating incredible starvation.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]. You're welcome."," "]}

I was worried about you. I thought you were going to have a heart attack.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I thought I was too. [Laughter] I'm with you on that.","[INTERVIEWED].. Okay, my opening statement: I didn't know what the guy said, but I saw his sole. [Laughter] You were more concerned than I was. I was watching your faces.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I saw something black and round go by my face.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Just to see that——","[INTERVIEWED].. ——his first—other than shoes. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——to duck. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm pretty good at ducking, as most of you will know——","[INTERVIEWER1]. You were quick.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——ducking——","[INTERVIEWED].. I'm talking about ducking your questions. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. So you weren't a lame duck. [Groans]","[INTERVIEWED].. That bad? You know, I— look, I mean it was just a bizarre moment, but I've had other bizarre moments in the Presidency. I remember when Hu Jintao was here. Remember we had the big event? He's speaking, and all of a sudden I hear this noise, had no earthly idea what was taking place, but it was the Falun Gong woman screaming at the top of her lungs. It was kind of an odd moment.","Questions? We're going to Afghanistan now, in case you hadn't been told. You probably thought we were going home, but no. Then we're going to go to—never mind. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, not to belabor the point too much, on this man, but I have a serious question about it. Obviously, he's expressing a vein of anger that exists in Iraq, and——","[INTERVIEWED].. How do you know? I mean, how do we know what he's expressing? Who——","[INTERVIEWER1]. We had a translator who said he shouted about the widows and orphans.","[INTERVIEWED].. I don't know. I've heard all kinds of stories. I heard he was representing a Baathist TV station. I don't know the facts, but let's find out the facts. All I'm telling you, it was a bizarre moment.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I wanted to ask something broader.","[INTERVIEWED].. I don't think you can take one guy throwing shoes and say this represents a broad movement in Iraq. You can try to do that if you want to. I don't think it would be accurate.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, then, separately from him——","[INTERVIEWED]. That's exactly what he wanted you to do. Like, I answered on your question, what he wanted you to do was to pay attention to him. And sure enough, you did. Now, look, I'm not suggesting you can't avoid it. But it——","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, how do you—how well do you think Iraq will transition from U.S. forces moving out of cities, pulling out, taking over——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, I think it's going to be that the gains we have made are strong enough to accept the movement of troops into—out of cities into bases by June of this year. But more importantly, that's what General Odierno thinks is possible.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——at this point about when you look at Iraq, and you still have over 140,000 troops. What are the challenges you see?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think the challenges— many of the challenges are political. In other words, the first big challenge is to have Provincial elections that enable people to vote and feel a part of the system, followed by national elections. That's a challenge. This is a challenge, however, that the Iraqis have met before. And obviously, you know, like the SOFA debate, it was a challenge to get SOFA through the— and SFA through the Council of Representatives because of the politics. But nevertheless, they came together.","Young democracies, when they debate big issues, sometimes can be strained. For example, there's a big debate going on between the central Government and the Provincial governments. But we went through the same debates ourselves. And as the society matures, they're going to be able to handle these debates in better fashion. So one of the important things was the success of the SFA/SOFA.","I remember the headlines: falling apart, may not make, confident it will happen, not confident it will happen. I mean, there was a lot of different opinions about whether or not this would eventually happen. And one reason why is because many of the people from the outside covering the debate on the inside were perplexed by the politics that was going on. But this is a democratic society. So I think the political process will be a challenge.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, you got your first look at a part of Baghdad that wasn't the green zone and wasn't a military base. What did you think of it?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, Mark [Mark Knoller, CBS Radio], look, I can't look at a stretch of road and draw a conclusion. I can only really react to what the people who have been here for a period of time tell me. And I mean, the statistics tell you one thing. Obviously, when you look at the violence chart, it's down. But what's more important from my perspective is, can a government meet the needs of its people? Can they get beyond differences and come together and meet the needs of its people? As well as, are the Iraqi forces becoming more capable of providing more security? Is command and control structure better? Are the training missions better? Are they able to move from point A to point B in a way that is—enable them to have successful missions? When there's actionable intelligence, can they move?","And when you couple that with a political process that is relatively new compared to older democracies and the need to provide basic services for its people, one of the things that struck me was not the road, but was the amount of electricity there was inside Baghdad. It looked like a pretty well-lit city.","The other thing that struck me was, there was a lot of activity on the ground. Now, you got to remember, my frame of reference is different from you all, you who have been there. I saw a lot of kids playing soccer; I saw a lot of activity, a lot of street activity on the route we took. And General Odierno said a while ago that wouldn't have been the case.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You've always urged patience in withdrawing troops, coming out; you move slowly on that based on conditions on the ground. Now you're talking about within 6 months, that we'll be drawing combat brigades from the city.","[INTERVIEWED]. Cities, right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think that the Iraqis are ready to step up to that now? Do you think that there are flaws or there—not flaws, but potential conflicts——","[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I strongly objected to a politics timetable. The debate over the timetable of withdrawal was a—was one that was unilateral in nature proposed by people who didn't think we ought to be in Iraq in the first place.","Secondly, I agreed to the terms of the SOFA because General Petraeus and General Odierno said that these terms are reasonable terms, and that is, we'll be moving troops out of cities into bases, close by to help if need be. Just because a troop is on a base doesn't mean that that troop won't be available to help the Iraqi forces. So they've come to the considered judgment that in the cities, the Iraqis are capable of providing security.","There is a plan in place that has been executed—successfully executed—that now the Iraqis can assume and continue to fulfill. That's a lot different than it was 18 months ago, when the plan was on paper and hadn't been executed yet. And so there's been a model for success.","Presidential Transition/Iraq Policy/Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA)/Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that what you meant by a bipartisan foundation now looking ahead to the next Presidency?","[INTERVIEWED]. I meant by a bipartisan foundation that the debates on whether or not it was the right thing or not are past, the need to make sure that we continue the successes can be a bipartisan—can be bipartisan and should be bipartisan.","President-elect Obama has now got a seasoned general in Baghdad with a SFA/ SOFA agreed to by the United States and Iraq, and by the way, has been kept abreast upon election about what the SOFA—or the SFA/SOFA means.","And one of the challenges for the Iraqis is going to be—for the U.S. is to get up to our committees and get working on the SFA, which we're going to do. Part of my mission here was to remind the Iraqi Government that there is still a lot of work to be done on SFA/SOFA; our embassy agrees with that as well. And that—but I also told them that I—that our transition is going to be a seamless transition, and that—I'm never going to put words into President-elect Obama's mouth, but by the decisions he made with Secretary Gates, for example, I believe he understands the strategic importance of Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. And now he's got a framework from which to make decisions.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, Iraq is obviously a big concern for Americans, but the economy seems to be even more of a concern. The automakers are in dire straits. How soon do you think your administration will be coming out with its plan for emergency aid? And are you leaning towards dipping into TARP to help——","[INTERVIEWED]. No question that the economy is number one on people's mind, and it should be. We're in a recession. These are serious economic times. People are concerned about their jobs; people are concerned about their value of their 401(k)s. This is a very difficult period.","We took note that there was a majority in the House and the Senate that voted for a package for the autos that would have caused them to begin to show how they're going to be viable. In other words, I have made this statement that given the status of the financial system, an abrupt bankruptcy for the autos could be devastating for the economy. And therefore, we've tried to work with Congress to accomplish the objective of not cratering the economy as well as making sure good money doesn't go after bad.","So we're now in the process of working through with the stakeholders a way forward, and we're not quite ready to announce that yet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you have any timetable, though, that you're looking at?","[INTERVIEWED]. Obviously, we're—this will not be a long process because of the economic—the fragility of the autos.","Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)","[INTERVIEWER1]. And, sir, are you leaning towards using the TARP money?","[INTERVIEWED]. I signaled that that's a possibility.","White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. You guys have 8 minutes left. You're going to Afghanistan. You might want to ask——","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——talk about it.","[INTERVIEWED]. Is that where we're going?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I think so. That's what you said. And I trust you with that. Can you tell me what—define the mission of the troops going in there in January and those who Secretary Gates wants in by the summer, the additional——","[INTERVIEWED]. The mission we had before, which is help this young democracy develop the institutions so it can survive on its own, to not repeat the mistakes of the 1980s, which is achieve an objective and leave, and deny a safe haven for Al Qaida.","Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News] asked me the question about the conditions in Afghanistan. No question, the violence is up. But one reason why the violence is up is that we're now putting troops into places where there hadn't been troops, begin to press these guys in places where they hadn't been pressed.","Just like the surge. You might remember, violence went up when we went into Iraq with more troops. And so the objective is to provide enough security so that a political system can develop that will be a— provide a stable platform for economic viability, and get a good education and good health.","Now the degree of difficulty in Afghanistan is high. This is a significantly larger country than Iraq and significantly poorer. The infrastructure is difficult. But nevertheless, the mission is essential, and that is, we cannot achieve our objective of removing Al Qaida safe havens by kicking out Taliban and saying, \"Okay, now let's leave.\"","And so I recognize we needed more troops. You know, President-elect Obama is going to be making decisions on troops, and we've been calling upon our NATO allies to put in more troops. One of the things that when—was barely noticed was the quiet surge in Afghanistan. We had kind of level platform of troops; then we moved in quite a few number, and so did our NATO allies. And now there's going to be—ramp up some more.","[INTERVIEWER1]. In Pakistan, I know that there are plans being worked up that combine—that you have to look at Pakistan and Afghanistan as the problem. Can you talk a little bit about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Obviously, if Pakistan is a place from which people feel comfortable attacking infrastructure, citizens, troops, then it's still going—it's going to make it difficult to succeed in Afghanistan. That's why we're working with the Pakistan Government to keep the pressure on the extremists. And the more that we can get Pakistan and Afghanistan to cooperate, the easier it will be to enforce that part of the border region.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What's your assessment of how Pakistan is doing on that front? Are they——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the first question is, is there a determination——","[At this point, there was a slight disturbance aboard Air Force One.]","[INTERVIEWED]. ——the other shoe just dropped. [Laughter] Look, I'm going to be thinking of shoe jokes for a long time. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Are you?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. I haven't heard any good ones yet.","President Zardari is determined; he's said so publicly, and he's said so to me privately. He looked at me in the eye and said, \"You don't need to talk to me about extremist violence; after all, my wife got killed by extremists.\" Like a lot of other situations in which you're trying to deal with extremists who get embedded in the population, there are two aspects. One is to pressure them and to bring them to justice and, simultaneously, try to win the hearts and minds of the local folks, which is what is happening Ira[INTERVIEWER1].","See, in Iraq, just remember, we did a clear, semi-build, and no hold. And it's the same concept in Afghanistan: clear, build, and hold. And it required 30,000 more troops to get that done, plus the training mission in Iraq to get enough troops to hold. Obviously, our commanders believe that the hold part is good enough for us to be able to move our troops. You understand the reason I moved troops out of cities into bases is to enhance the credibility of the Government.","Well, in Afghanistan, the same principle applies. We have cleared, and we have built some, but in certain Provinces we have not held. So now more troops will go in, and as they start to move, you'll see violence tick up because they're clearing new areas. PRTs, which were very successful in Iraq, are now being increased in Afghanistan. That's part of the build part. And training up Afghanis to be a part of the hold is going to take a while. But nevertheless, there's optimism there because the Afghan fighters are good fighters; they're proud to be in the military, and we're headed toward 135,000.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You said there were two elements to Pakistan's work though. You said one was whether Zardari was determined; you said he was. What was the——","[INTERVIEWED]. That's the press—find them and get them, press them hard, and then win the hearts and minds of the locals through economic development.","Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Afghanistan-Pakistan Border Regions","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, was that made more difficult by the use of UAVs? Are you and Hamid Karzai on the same page on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as you know—you know very well that when it comes to certain matters, the U.S. Government doesn't discuss operations.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, Afghanistan is made up of a lot of different ethnic groups.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. A lot of them do not support Hamid Karzai. Is he the right person to lead the country through the next——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that will be determined by the Afghanistan people. That's the great thing about elections. He got 55 percent. You know, some of us would have loved to have 55 percent. [Laughter] And 51.5, not bad.","So the way you resolve a question like that is to have open and transparent elections. I believe strongly in the election process because it is the best way to determine for certain what people think. You know, a controversial decision of mine was to press forward with the elections in the Palestinian territories. I was told, \"Well, the wrong side may win.\" My attitude is, the best way to determine what the people think is to let them vote.","And Hamas didn't win because they said we promise you violence; Hamas said we'd win because we promise you better services. So my answer to the losers of the election is, if they have credibility at providing better services, why don't you figure out how you can do a better job and respond to the people? That's what elections do.","So the election process in Afghanistan will once again provide people an opportunity to say, \"We're tired of this, or we appreciate that.\" And it's the good public servant who listens to what the people say.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Mr. President, if there was one—I'm sorry, go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned the Middle East. Is there any more to do in your remaining 37 days on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Ed [Edwin Chen, Bloomberg News], we've—Condi is working a U.N. Security Council that affirms the Annapolis process. The question would be, will President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert want to lay out a specific state? And that's to be determined. But there is a way forward now.","The big sea change in the Middle East on this issue is that by far the majority of people recognize that the only way to peace is two states. And in 2001, that was not the case. In 2001, most of the Israeli political class believed that \"greater Israel\" was the only way to have security. And the Palestinian Authority was run by a person who could not deliver peace and was not trustworthy. So now you've got a Palestinian President who recognizes Israel's right to exist, and a Israeli political class that says, \"If we want security, if we want peace, we've got to work for a Palestinian state.\" So the framework is there.","And the other point—the other significant change was that Annapolis brought many in the Arab world to the table. And in order for there to ever be a Palestinian state, any Palestinian leader is going to have to have strong backing from the neighboring states, which was one of the reasons why Camp David fell apart under my predecessor. In other words, the other reason why is because the interlocutor on the Palestinian side just was—failed the Palestinian people. Not President—this was not President Clinton's fault.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Just—in fact, it's sort of a wrap-up question——","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm going to go take a nap. Anybody—[laughter].","[INTERVIEWER1]. If there is one thing you wish——","[INTERVIEWED]. Steven Lee [Steven Lee Myers, The New York Times], you want to take a nap?","[INTERVIEWER1]. No, I'm all right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. He doesn't need sleep.","[INTERVIEWED]. You look a little—[laughter]. Mind if I call you Jimmy Lee?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Steven Lee.","[INTERVIEWED]. Stevie Lee, I mean.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Stevie. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. If there is anything, when you look at this last month or so you have left, that you wish you could accomplish, in the foreign policy arena, or anything you want to say? If you had a single thing that you want to accomplish, what would it be?","[INTERVIEWED]. Last month? Well, it's to solidify the frameworks that will enable problems to be solved.","Take, for example, the North Korean issue. It is much easier to solve a problem diplomatically when there is more than one voice speaking to the leader of North Korea. And a success of this administration is to put a framework in place that has China, the United States, and South Korea and Russia and Japan all at the table, all saying the same thing. In this case, the message is, we need to have a verifiable process in place to determine whether or not you're fulfilling your obligations.","Secondly, in the old process it used to be, we will give you what you ask for and hope that you respond. Now it is, here's what you must do if you want our help. We've reversed the process. And it's not just the United States speaking. So right now what you're watching is that the leader of North Korea is trying to test the process. First he said something Japan, and now he's saying something about so-and-so. And so the objective is to keep our partners firm on the understanding that the six-party process is the best way to solve the North Korean issue.","So he'll test—and this isn't the first time he's tested. He signed an agreement in September of 2005. Everybody said, \"Great, looks like we're on our way to having the problem solved.\" And then he tested and changed his mind and did this, that, and the other. And the key is to be firm and patient with a structure that will enable the next President or the next President after that to be able to solve the problem diplomatically.","So there's one area right there that we're working on. Obviously, the Security Council resolution on dealing with the Annapolis process. We got the SOFA—SFA/SOFA done on Iraq.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You got India done.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, India was done, but she said the last month.","End of Presidential Term/Afghanistan","[INTERVIEWER1]. Anything on Iraq, sir, in the last month?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Afghanistan?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think I should travel to Afghanistan in the last month of my Presidency, although it's not exactly the last month. So what's the date?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Why is it you want to be in Afghanistan?","[INTERVIEWED]. I want to be in Afghanistan to say thank you to President Karzai, to let the people of Afghanistan know that the United States has stood with them and will stand with them. See, it's—if you notice, Steven Lee asked a good question— bipartisan foundation. These nations need to know that the United States has been with them, is with them, and will be with them. So the trip is a way to, say thanks to leaders that I have been working with for a long period of time.","By the way, both leaders in my last conversations, or the last couple of them, have been saying, \"You must come and visit us before you leave.\" And of course, I never committed until however long it was ago, 48 hours ago.","So okay, I'm going to go take a nap.","NOTE: The interview began at 11:39 p.m. aboard Air Force One en route to Afghanistan.

{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmembersthewhitehousepresspoolheiligendammgermany","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me start off by talking about my speech yesterday. The purpose of the speech is to remind our allies and those who are wondering as to whether or not the United States is firmly committed to democracy that we are. I strongly believe that we are in a war with a group of ideologues and that we can eventually win this war by promoting an alternative ideology.","And so the speech yesterday was to speak clearly to people around the world that the United States is committed to this freedom agenda, that there is a realistic reason why we promote freedom, that it's for our own security. There's a moral imperative to promote freedom, and that is to recognize that there are people who live in societies that are still repressive and that free nations have an obligation to work to secure their liberty. I made it very clear that democracy takes time, that it takes different forms in different places, but nevertheless, there are underlying principles which are essential to free societies.","I pointed out that freedom has made great progress over 20 years. The reason I did that was, one, to express my optimism about the future. But, two, make it clear that things—the freedom agenda just doesn't bloom overnight; it takes hard work. But I also made it clear, it's necessary work. And then, as you know, I went around the world and talked about different spots around the world.","And I think it's very important for the G-8—nations in the G-8 to recognize the power of liberty to transform societies. And so I'll be talking, of course, about that here. I think it's important for nations that are free to recognize they have an obligation to help others. I was moved by the people I met. It was just very heartwarming to meet with heroic souls that do have the capacity, with proper support, of changing their societies and, therefore, changing the world.","Anyway, it was an important speech to give. It's always important for the American President to keep setting an agenda based upon values. And those of you who followed me know full well that I believe that liberty has transformed Europe, liberty has transformed the Far East, and I believe liberty can transform the Middle East. And I'm determined to advance that cause.","Here at the G-8, there's obviously a variety of subjects. One, it's going to be very important for us to continue to discuss climate change in a way that actually accomplishes an objective, which is the reduction of greenhouse gases over time and the advancement of technologies, which will yield to better environmental policy as well as energy security.","The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal, as well as a—I said, the remedy, and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialog. So I laid out an agenda that can move the process forward within the framework of the United Nations, that, in essence, says that we'll be setting a goal at the end of 2008—that \"we\" being the major emitters—within the framework of the U.N. In other words, this will fold into the U.N. framework. And that enables us to get China and India at the table to discuss how we can all move forward together.","Secondly, in my speech, I said we'll come up with our own policies to meet an interim goal for our country as well as a national goal—or international goal for the rest of the world. And I'll be talking to Angela about that at lunch. I think it fits into her desires to see the process move forward. One of the concerns was, is that there would not be a constructive result of this meeting that basically announced that there should be a post-Kyoto framework. And we will achieve that objective here at the G-8 because we will have set a post-Kyoto framework.","This is an important subject. I also hope we spend an equal amount of time on HIV/ AIDS on the continent of Africa or reducing malaria on the continent of Africa or helping feed the hungry. So it's a—and finally, it's going to be important for us to continue to discuss vital cooperation on fighting extremists and radicals who still pose a threat to our respective nations. The temptation is to sit back and say, well, maybe they're not dangerous anymore because they haven't launched an attack on our respective homelands. They are dangerous, they do want to attack, and the best way to deal with it is to work closely together.","Anyway, I'm looking forward to this. It's obviously a lovely spot. I've been here before. I think some of you came with me— nice and relaxing. Went for a good-hour bike ride today with a couple of Secret Service agents and some German police, got out in the woods and charged around, felt pretty good about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can we ask some questions?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. That's all I wanted to tell you. Go on home. [Laughter] I feel so good about life, I'm not going to answer questions. [Laughter] No—yes, you can, please. Please ask a few.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What kind of military response would the United States take if Russia retargeted its missiles on Europe, as President Putin has threatened?","[INTERVIEWED]. As I said yesterday that Russia is not an enemy. There needs to be no military response because we're not at war with Russia.","You know, my first meeting with Vladimir Putin, I told him, I said, \"What we need to do is get the cold war behind us and work constructively on how to deal with the threats of the 21st century.\" Russia is not a threat; nor is the missile defense we're proposing a threat to Russia. So I'm going to talk to Vladimir about that. I've already talked to him about it once on the telephone. I sent Bob Gates to talk to him. And we'll have a good dialog about how we can constructively work together to deal with—modernize our capacity to deal with the threat to the—the true threats.","So I don't see any military response needed. Russia is not going to attack Europe. The missile defense system is not aimed at Russia. As a matter of fact, I believe it would be in Russia's interest to participate with us, and have made that offer and will continue to make the offer.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you take that threat seriously, though?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think Vladimir Putin intends to attack Russia—I mean, Europe. So I'll talk to him about it, but it's—if he's saying, \"The missile defense system is a threat to us,\" our—the need, therefore, is to make clear there is not.","By the way, a missile defense system that is deployed in Europe can handle one or two rocket launchers. It can't handle a multiple-launch regime. Russia has got an inventory that could overpower any missile defense system. The practicality is, is that this aimed at a country like Iran, if they ended up with a nuclear weapon, so that they couldn't blackmail the free world.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you make of his motivation for all——","[INTERVIEWED]. I haven't had a chance to talk to him about it. I'm going to.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right, and say, this is just some sort of misunderstanding that he doesn't—you don't see any political purpose behind what he's doing?","[INTERVIEWED]. For his own sake inside his country? I'm not sure. I haven't had a chance to visit with him about that. As you know, I've got a visit here, and then I'll visit with him in Maine.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it might be an effort to obtain bargaining chips for negotiating over other issues, like Kosovo?","[INTERVIEWED]. I talked to him about Kosovo the other day, and I don't recall missile defense coming up. In other words, it wasn't a quid pro quo. So, he's got deep concerns about Kosovo, and so do we. It's an issue that we're just going to have to continue to work with him on. We believe we ought to move the Ahtisaari plan forward through the United Nations, and he's got reservations about it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Garry Kasparov, who you met with yesterday, has said that Russia is now a police state, and he said the West should stop giving Putin democratic credentials. What do you——","[INTERVIEWED]. I think there are—as I said yesterday, society has advanced a long way from the old Soviet era. There is a growing middle class; there is prosperity; there's elections. It's interesting you would ask the question. Do you think he is trying to position himself at home? Thereby meaning that he is concerned about public opinion, which is a sign that there is a— when public opinion influences leadership, it is an indication that there is involvement of the people. I think what you're referring to is the upcoming elections. Is he trying to say something about the upcoming elections? I frankly haven't talked to him about that aspect. But if, in fact, he is concerned about the upcoming elections, it does say something about the state of the political scene in Russia.","And as I said yesterday, we've got a friendship with Russia, and there is a lot of common interest in Russia. But I expressed concerns about what were Western expectations and what has now happened inside Russia, for example, rule of law or some press decisions he's made. I've had these discussions with Vladimir frankly over my time as President. I remember our meeting in Slovakia. It was a good, frank discussion about decisions he's made, and he asked me about decisions I made.","Now, the fundamental question is, does it make sense to have relations with Russia? I think it does. Do we agree on everything? No, we don't. Are there areas where we can work together? You bet. And that's why I call it a complex relationship.","Same issue with China. China has got a—we've got an economic interest in China. We've got interest with China in working with North Korea, just like we have with Russia. And yet we disagree with China's reluctance to advance the democratic process.","[INTERVIEWER1]. On the issue of climate change, are you frustrated at always being portrayed as the odd man out? And what do you make of the portrayals of the U.S. trying to upstage Merkel with your climate announcement last week?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, Angela Merkel and I have had a lot of discussions about this issue. And as I told you, she was interested in whether or not there should be a— whether or not we agree there ought to be a post-Kyoto framework. And my announcement clearly said there should be one and that the United States will be directly involved in developing that framework.","I've got a very substantial record when it comes to advancing technologies to make the air cleaner in the United States. We've actually had a reduction of greenhouse gases and—in spite of the fact that our economy grew. In other words, it's hard to reduce greenhouse gases in the face of economic growth, but we were able to do so. We've laid out a substantial initiative when it comes to tailpipe emissions, and that is the reduction of our usage of gasoline by 20 percent over a 10-year period. So I'm looking forward to telling people exactly what we've done here in the United States.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Will you give any ground on the two-degree target that she wants?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I talked about what I'm for—remember? I said I'm for sitting together with the nations, to sit down and discuss a way forward. I think when people really look at what I've said, they say, well, that's an interesting way to bridge the difference between what China has said, for example, and what others in Europe have said. And in order for there to be—first of all, you're not going to have greenhouse gas emissions that mean anything unless all nations, all emitters are at the table. And if China is not a part of the process, we all can make major strides, and yet there won't be a reduction until China and India are participants. And what I have said, is, here's a way to get China and India at the table.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back to your democracy speech?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Did you like it?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I loved it.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. Say that in your stories.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I'll say it anywhere. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. What did he say?","[INTERVIEWER1]. I'll say it anywhere.","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay, good. How about in print? [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Oh, well——","[INTERVIEWED]. That may be taking it too far. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. How do you square your commitment to democracy and as a priority for your foreign policy with what we're seeing in Pakistan now, major ally in the war on terror, but also a place where a core leadership of Al Qaida has found some sanctuary in tribal areas. The Government has been taking a repressive attitude toward a free press; it's got into this conflict with the judiciary, firing the chief justice. Have you had conversations with Musharraf about democracy in his country? Do you want to see free and fair elections in Pakistan?","[INTERVIEWED]. I do, and said that in Pakistan the time I was there, standing right next to President Musharraf. And we do discuss democracy, as well as routing out foreigners in his country who are an equal threat, a threat to America and a threat to him.","It's a very—Pakistan is an important ally in this war against these extremists. As you mentioned, there are some in his country, and I'm convinced that he would like to rout them out. But it's not easy territory in which to rout people out. We've had some successes inside Pakistan, thanks to his leadership. And in terms of the democracy issues, he's going to have to deal with it. And the interesting question is, is the issue about uniform, and he addressed that at the last—only time I've been in Pakistan. He said he would seriously consider—I don't want to put words—you'll have to pull up the press conference.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But if you think democracy is the best way to confront radicals and terrorists, shouldn't we be pushing hard for democracy to really get established in Pakistan?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, democracy is—it's a lot more established in Pakistan than some of the other nations I mentioned. And there's upcoming elections. And what you're seeing is a lot of posturing about the election process, and it's not perfect. Neither was our democracy perfect for 100 years when we enslaved people.","And so it's—we do push for democracy. We push in the context of the reality on the ground as well. I mentioned Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a close ally in the war on terror. His Majesty has done and his services have done the world a service, a good service by bringing people to justice. And he is also making some incremental reforms. He will go at a pace slower than some would like to see; nevertheless, he's moving. And the question is, is there progress?","We live in a world where people expect things to happen overnight, and that's just not the way it works. I think it's going to be important for whoever is President to take a long-term view of the ability of democracies to progress and, therefore, change.","I mentioned South Korea as an example of what I'm talking about. I'm sure—I suspect that if a President were having this conversation with a press corps in the sixties and seventies, they'd say, well, we're for democracy; therefore, how come you're not? How come it hadn't happened yet in South Korea? And yet it did eventually happen in South Korea.","The process and progress move at different paces and different places, and the role of the United States is to help encourage them along, while at the same time achieving certain national objectives. It just so happens that the key national objective in the beginning of the 21st century is to make sure we don't get attacked again and innocent people get murdered. And so we can do both. We can say that in the long run, the best way to secure your society is through liberty. In the short run, let's work collaboratively to protect ourselves.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back on missile shields for a second?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Vladimir Putin says that you're building a shield for weapons that don't exist now——","[INTERVIEWED]. Right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Doesn't he have a point? Do you see why he might be suspicious of that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would argue that it's best to anticipate what might happen and work to see that it doesn't happen, as opposed to not be prepared if it does happen. I mean, if somebody pops up with a weapon and says, \"Hands up,\" people will say, well, how come we didn't have a shield? And so it's—I think we need to do both. I think we need to protect ourselves of what might happen and then work collaboratively to make sure it doesn't happen.","[INTERVIEWER1]. On the missile defense system: If there's a misunderstanding between President Putin saying that this is a threat towards Russia and the U.S. saying it is not, what's more important, pushing the system through or maintaining a solid, good relationship with Russia, especially since he's leaving office?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it's important to make sure we have a system to protect ourselves against the threats of the 21st century, the true threats. And that would be the threat of rogue regimes using a weapon of mass destruction to either blackmail and/or attack allies and friends, cells moving through our societies with the intent upon killing, radical forces undermining young democracies. Those are the threats, and therefore, we need to address them.","And I will continue to work with President Putin—Vladimir Putin—to explain to him that this is not aimed at him. And there's all kinds of ways you can do that. One is total transparency between our militaries and scientists—military people and scientists, which I'm more than happy to do.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you see this as hurting the relationship between you and President Putin?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. As I said, it's a complex relationship. We've had issues before. I think if you look at the history of our relationship, there's been some moments where we've agreed and moments where we disagreed. That's just the way—that's what happens when you've got nations that are influential.","And we've had our disagreements with different allies, had disagreements with France over Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. We've had disagreements with other nations, but that doesn't mean they're not friends, or that doesn't mean we can't work with them.","Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are you at all concerned, though, that this current state of the relationship between you and President Putin might have some implications for the outcome with regard to Iran? You've sort of relied on his——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we've been working very closely with Russia on Iran, and I don't think that this—first of all, my comments yesterday were very realistic in the sense that said, we're friends; we've got a complex relationship; we can work together, but we've had some disagreements. I just don't see how—why that, those kinds of statements are going to prevent the United States and Russia from working closely together on key issues like Iran or proliferation, areas where we can get along.","Obviously, there's disagreement. You mentioned Kosovo. No question, he doesn't agree with our position. And so we've got to work together and see if we can't understand each other on a lot of issues. But it's an interesting question about, well, shouldn't you just scrap the system? And the answer is, is that the system exists in the first place to deal with threats. And that's why it needs to go forward.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask about Darfur?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Have you expressed your frustration with why the international community hasn't been moving on Darfur? You obviously introduced sanctions. Would you be prepared to see a no-fly zone over Darfur to have some direct interaction?","[INTERVIEWED]. We would consider that. And, yes, I've expressed my frustrations.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You would consider it in what context? Would you want to see other people help establish——","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I want to see other people helping Darfur and—by joining us and sending clearer and stronger messages to President Bashir. And yeah, I'm frustrated. It—because there are still people suffering, and yet the U.N. process is moving at a snail's pace. As you know, I gave this speech at the Holocaust Museum and caveated it because the Secretary-General asked for a reasonable period of time to see if he could not get the process moving.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And the reasonable period is over?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it was. That's why I gave my speech. And I don't know if you noticed, but Sudan is now headed to peacekeeping at the U.N.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, will you pardon Scooter Libby?","[INTERVIEWER1]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. It's interesting, isn't it? And the second in charge is Iran.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And a no-fly zone, have you——","[INTERVIEWED]. I can't give you all the tactics on it yet, but I understand the principle and said so in my speech that we would consider such.","Listen, that was a sad day for—yesterday was a very sad day for Scooter and his family. But there's an ongoing process, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss it until the process has run its course.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Do you think it says something about you and Vice President Cheney, that you continue to embrace a man who has been convicted and sentenced?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, it's a sad day for him, and my heart goes out to his family. And it wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss the case until after the legal remedies have run its course.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, there's a lot of speculation that you are going to pardon——","[INTERVIEWED]. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].","[INTERVIEWER1]. Back to Russia?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, back to Russia. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Fun stuff. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Nice going, Terry. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah, right. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. You seemed to have carefully calibrated your response to some of the comments that you made——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think what you ought to do—look, I would suggest going back and looking at a series of my responses. In other words, put—and yesterday was an important speech to give about democracies. And I think in terms—if you want to really figure out how I conduct relations with Russia, it would be helpful for you—if you're interested in writing a genuinely—I know you are—an indepth piece about how I've conducted relations with Russia to look at different comments I have made relative to different moments of drama or moments of discord or moments of agreement.","And I have always said that, one, this is an important relationship. It's an important relationship because when we work together, we can solve problems. I've also said it's a complex relationship because there are disagreements. You asked why— I haven't had a chance to talk to him about it. The insinuation was that he's doing this for internal political reasons. I can't make that the case, and it would be unfair for me to put words in his mouth, and so therefore, I won't.","I've also said it's important for there to be a personal relationship between me and President Putin so that we can have frank discussions in a way that enables us to more likely deal with the problems we face. That's why I'll visit with him here, and that's why I'm looking forward to welcoming him to my dad's house in Kennebunkport. It's an opportunity to continue to have a serious dialog with serious players in trying to keep the peace.","There will be disagreements; that's just the way life works. And—but that doesn't necessarily lend itself to speculation that somehow the relationship between me and [INTERVIEWED] is not a positive relationship. It is a positive, and I'm going to work to keep it that way.","There are some who say we shouldn't have any relations with Russia. I strongly disagree with that. I think it's important for us to maintain relations with Russia and—on a variety of fronts, whether it be— you know, look, I want him to join the WTO for a reason. I believe it's—I think if trade increases between Russia and the United States, it's important to have some structure and ways to resolve the inevitable disagreements that will arise. And that's what happens not only with a nation like Russia; that's what happens all the time in Europe. There's trade disputes where there needs to be a dispute resolution mechanism. And that's one of the things that the WTO provides.","Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You talked about the need to prevent extremists from getting their hands on oil in the Middle East or anywhere else. How would you characterize how Vladimir Putin manages his country's energy resources?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, he is— he has got the opportunity to really develop the greatest asset of Russia, and that's her brainpower. He's inherited a very difficult situation in Russia. The demographics indicate that it will be a shrinking society for a variety of reasons. One, it's health care system is good in parts of the country and not so good in other parts. They've got a needle issue; they've got HIV/AIDS issues. They've got a series of issues that he knows he has to deal with. They've got an old pensioner system. So that cashflow from oil will enable him to modernize his society, and he's making steps to do that.","Secondly, it is a—obviously, it creates tensions with Europe. His being a sole source of natural gas for certain countries creates a degree of tension, and that's why the European Union and Russia are continuing to work through their issues.","The fundamental question is, will he make enough investment in his oil infrastructure to take advantage of these cashflows and, at the same time, make an investment inside his country? And he believes he is committed, enhancing human capital. The question is, is that—is the middle class going to continue to grow? It looks like it has grown substantially in the past.","This country, again, is certainly not perfect in the eyes of many Americans. On the other hand, if you consider where it's come from, it has made substantial progress toward a freer society in the sense that there is a middle class that's growing and will eventually make more demands. Now, having said that, there's been—as I said yesterday, there's been some backtracking. We had expectations, and those expectations weren't met.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I ask about Iraq? The idea of the surge seemed to be to buy some time for the political leaders in Iraq to make progress on reconciliation. Have you seen any real, meaningful progress on that front?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, look, they're close to getting an oil deal done. It's—it hadn't been the closure on certain issues, but they're working hard to get it there.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is that—I mean, they've been talking about that for a long time. It doesn't seem that they—the increased security operations have moved them to speed——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think on certain fronts, they have made progress. They've got a budget that's now moved out. They've got a—I know they're working on an oil law. They're working on different—discussing whether or not they have Provincial elections, and we hope they get—hope these issues come to fruition.","But you're right, that's what the surge is intended to do, plus provide enough time for these Iraqi forces to step in, prevent the sectarian violence from spilling out of the capital. What's difficult is the fact that Al Qaida continues to kill. And it frustrates the Iraqi people, and it should frighten the American people that Al Qaida is active in Iraq looking for a safe haven from which to launch further attacks. And they're the primary—they're the ones primarily responsible for these EID [IED] * and suicide bombers.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can I go back to Brendan's [Brendan Murray, Bloomberg News] question for a second?","[INTERVIEWED]. What was it?","[INTERVIEWER1]. About Russia's economic situation and the use of its oil wells. I guess my question is, are you concerned that Russia's enormous energy wealth is going to kind of create a situation where its leaders are vulnerable to the arrogance of power? In other words, they've got an immense amount of wealth concentrated in their hands, and inevitably that tends to make people act in aggressive ways, doesn't it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think what—one reason why I promote rule of law throughout the world is to make sure that that very scenario doesn't accelerate. A second initiative that we all have got to take is to diversify away from hydrocarbons, and that's what will eventually yield to national security and economic security for countries that are dependent upon hydrocarbons from other places, such as ourself.","You know, there is—there are mechanisms in place to basically enable nations to protect themselves; the EU is a mechanism. If you noticed, there's constant jockeying here in Europe with Russia about security. No question, some nations are concerned about their supplies of gas being used for political purposes. And therefore, all of us need to work collaboratively to convince nations not to do that, whether it be Russia or any other nation that is supplying hydrocarbons to the world.","You've heard me say, we import oil from places that don't necessarily like us. Oil is fungible, by the way. But nevertheless, we do. And therefore, it is in our interest, just like it's in the interest of other countries, to diversify. And that's really going to be the interesting challenge here as we move forward in this 21st century. One of the dividends of diversification through new technologies is better environmental quality. And that's why this issue is—it's got a real poignancy, as far as I'm concerned. One, I know we can be better stewards of the environment. But also, at the same time, it ends up making us less dependent on crude oil from overseas, in our case.","It's coming, and the question is, how do you stimulate new technologies? What is the most effective way to get technologies to the market that will enable the world to control greenhouse gases, for example? And that's really where the—see, once you get people to agree to a goal, then the next question that needs to be answered is, how best to achieve that goal? We've taken the lead in achieving that goal by spending billions of dollars on new technologies.","We've got new technologies being advanced in cellulosic ethanol. That will help nations once that becomes able to compete in the market. There's new battery technologies being promoted, primarily out of Japan. But nevertheless, it's—will have the beneficial effect of enabling people to drive without the use of gasoline. Clean coal technologies are going to be a really important part of a strategy to deal with what will be an international goal.","And so the question is, how best to stimulate that type of investment? And that's an important discussion to have here at the G-8. It's also an important discussion to have at home.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Iran—President Ahmadi-nejad says that Iran's nuclear program cannot be stopped. Is he right?","[INTERVIEWED]. Therefore, let's build a missile defense system. And, yes, we're going to work to stop him. That's why we are constantly working through diplomatic channels to continue to apply pressure. And I mentioned the other day, I think we need to go back to the U.N. Security Council. And we'll see.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You mentioned South Korea earlier. Do you think South Korea could be a model for Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that—first of all, the situation inside South Korea is different—or was different than it is in Ira[INTERVIEWER1]. On the other hand, U.S. presence enabled the South Korean economy and system to evolve and, at the same time, provided assurances to the Chinese and the Japanese.","And you hear me say that—and compare the situation in the Middle East to what happened in the Far East. It's not to say that the cultures were the same or the difficulties in the different countries are the same. It is to say, however, that the U.S. can provide a presence in order to give people confidence necessary to make decisions that will enable democracies to emerge and say to other people, step back and let the democracies emerge.","It's very interesting to note that the U.S. presence in the Far East was welcomed by different countries with different interests. But it helped achieve an objective for all of us, and today, the Far East is peaceful. And it wasn't peaceful at the end of the Korean war; it was a place where thousands of Americans had lost lives.","And so the comparison between Korea and the Middle East is, again, not to say that the religious situation was the same— of course, it was different—nor to say that some of the influential players were the same; it's different. But it is to say that given time, these democracies will emerge.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you think of the new French President?","[INTERVIEWED]. I haven't met him yet—I have met him—excuse me—but not as President."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmichaelsmerconishthemichaelsmerconishmorningshow","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. Hi, everybody. Welcome back to the program. I'm Michael Smerconish. What an honor for me to say I'm live at the White House, and I'm joined by [INTERVIEWED] of the United States. [INTERVIEWED], what an honor for me, and thank you, sir, for this privilege, and thank you for coming back to my radio program.","[INTERVIEWED]. Michael, it's great to be on the show again. Every time we've been on, it's been a great time, so I appreciate the opportunity.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Folks are stacked up, as you might imagine. They're anxious to pose some questions about health care to the President of the United States. More than 5,000 e-mail suggestions have flowed through my web site in just the last 24 hours alone. If it's all right, I'll start by posing a couple of questions and some of the things that I continue to hear from folks, and we'll welcome phone callers as well.","Allow me, sir, to begin with this. Did Secretary Sebelius misspeak last weekend? You know, a great deal has been made as to what she said pertaining to the so-called public option.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. She really didn't misspeak. The surprising thing is, she'd been saying this all along. She said the same thing a month ago. And let me just describe what the issue is here. We have consistently talked about the need for health care reform because family premiums are going up three times faster than inflation and wages. The costs of Medicare and Medicaid will bankrupt this country if we don't reduce the cost inflation of health care. You've got families who can't get health care because of preexisting conditions, or they bump up against some lifetime cap if a family member gets really ill.","So what we've said is, there are a number of components of health care. One is that for people who already have health insurance, they can keep their health insurance, but we're going to have some consumer protections to regulate how insurers operate. For example, they can't prohibit people from getting it—health insurance—because of a preexisting condition. They can't have lifetime caps or yearly caps that prevent people from getting the care that they need.","We're also going—for people who don't have health insurance—to set up a system similar to what Congress has, where you can buy into a bigger pool, get better rates, have better protections around you. You would be buying that insurance from private insurers. But one of the options we talked about was a public option, where there wouldn't be a profit motive involved; it would be non-for-profit. And that public option would give you affordable health insurance.","Now, what we've said is, we think that's a good idea. But we haven't said that that's the only aspect of health insurance. And what she essentially said was, is that all these other insurance reforms are just as important as the public option. The press got a little excited, and some folks on the left got a little excited about this. Our position hasn't changed. We think that the key is cost control, competition, making sure that people have good, quality options. If we're able to achieve that, that's the end that we're seeking. And the means—you know, we can have some good arguments about what the best way to achieve it is, but we've got to change, because the status quo is unsustainable.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], there's a mindset among many folks in my audience who say that the endgame, it's all about single-payer, that it's a public option or it's a cooperative. And, sir, you know that there's a perception out there that you want it all. You know, you want to be in the banks, you want to be in the automotive industry, and now you want to be in health care. Can you address that mindset?","[INTERVIEWED]. I absolutely can. First of all, look, the intervention in the banks wasn't started by me; it was started by a conservative Republican administration. And rightly so, because our banks were on the verge of meltdown. The only thing that we've done is said let's put in place some financial regulations to make sure that this doesn't happen again.","The auto interventions weren't started by me; they were started by a conservative Republican administration. The only thing that we did was rather than just write GM and Chrysler a blank check, we said, you know what, if you're going to get any more taxpayer money, you've got to be accountable. They went through a record bankruptcy, and now GM for the first time is actually hiring folks back.","So I know that there's this perception that somehow we have engaged in these extraordinary interventions. Part of it had to do with the worst financial crisis in history. And the fact that both the auto bailout and the bank bailout were started under a previous, conservative Republican administration indicates the fact that this wasn't ideological; this was a matter of necessity.","Now, as far as health care goes, I've consistently said I would love the private marketplace to be handling this without any Government intervention. The problem is, it's not working. What we're seeing is about 14,000 folks lose their health insurance every single day. We are seeing health care inflation go up about twice as fast as regular inflation. Businesses are being crippled by it. Small businesses especially have almost no access to the marketplace because they've got no leverage with insurance companies.","So all we've said is, let's keep the private system intact, but let's make sure that people who right now can't get health insurance—about 46 million—that they're able to buy into the market. And number two, let's have some consumer protections to make sure that those of us who have health insurance don't end up getting a bad deal because we didn't read the fine print and we think that we have coverage; when we finally get sick and we need it, it turns out that we're vulnerable because insurance companies aren't operating in the interests of their customers.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I like to drive an MDX and an F-150, and I've communicated by e-mail in the last 24 hours with the woman who sold me the MDX and the guy who sold me the F-150, and each of them, [INTERVIEWED], are saying that Cash for Clunkers has been a great idea and a wonderful initiative, and they've closed a lot of deals, but the payments are late. And I'm hearing from a number of folks who say, \"Come on, if the Federal Government can't get it together relative to Cash for Clunkers, I don't want to entrust my health care to the Federal Government.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me first address Cash for Clunkers. It has been successful beyond anybody's imagination. And we're now slightly victims of success, because the thing happened so quick, there was so much more demand than anybody expected that dealers were overwhelmed with applications.","Now, this program has only been going on for a few weeks, and we have hired three times as many people to process this stuff as we originally had. There has not been extraordinary delays on the U.S. Government's part. I understand dealers want to get their money back as soon as possible, but the fact of the matter is, this is a good-news story; they are seeing sales that they have not seen in years.","And they will get their money, but we've got to process it properly, because if we were careless about it, if we were just sending out checks where applications were incomplete and so on, first of all, we'd be breaking the law because there are statutes set up in terms of how this is supposed to go. And secondly, there'd probably be some story—you'd be asking me about scandals, where there were a whole bunch of checks of taxpayer money being wasted, going out to people who hadn't actually bought cars.","So I think this is actually a high-class problem to have, that we're selling too many cars too quickly and there's some backlog in the application process. It is getting fixed.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], Ernie is a listener of mine on WTKK in Boston and wishes to pose the following question. Ernie, go ahead for the President of the United States.","[INTERVIEWER2]. Thank you, Michael. [INTERVIEWED]——","[INTERVIEWED]. How are you, Ernie?","[INTERVIEWER2]. I'm good. Thank you for taking this call.","[INTERVIEWED]. Great to talk to you.","[INTERVIEWER2]. I understand you've said that the Federal health care plan for Government employees is a pretty good plan.","[INTERVIEWED]. It is.","[INTERVIEWER2]. And Congress has voted, to my understanding, not to join the public plan once it passes because they want to keep their good Federal plan. Would you be willing to either urge Congress to have the Federal employees join the public plan, or would you be willing to urge Congress to somehow open up the Federal health plan to all Americans?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, Ernie. I hear this all the time, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's a great question, Ernie. First of all, understand that currently, Federal employees have a very good health care plan because they're able to leverage the insurance companies. There are so many members of their—of the Federal workforce that they can get the best rates possible, for every insurance company wants to do business with the Federal Government. So premiums are lower, and it's a better deal overall.","The same concept is what we're trying to do in setting up what's called a health insurance exchange. Essentially, it'd be a marketplace where people who currently don't have health insurance or small businesses could pool their numbers so they have leverage over the insurance companies. And they could go on a web site and look at the various options, the types of various private health insurance plans that are being offered, and choose the one that's best for their families. So we're actually trying to duplicate what exists for Federal employees. We want to make that available to everybody else.","Now, what we have said is, let's make a public option one choice of many choices that are available to people who are joining the exchange. And I see nothing wrong with potentially having that public option as one option for Federal employees as well.","But the important thing that I think I have to make absolutely clear: Nobody would be obligated to choose the public option. If you went on that web site and you said, you know what, Aetna or Blue Cross Blue Shield are offering a good deal, and I would rather choose that plan than the public plan, you'd be perfectly free to do so. Nobody would be saying, you are obligated to go into a public plan.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I think what folks are saying is that they'd love it if you'd stand up and say, whatever it is that we're creating, be it a co-op, be it a public option, whatever name ultimately might be ascribed to it, we in the executive branch, we in the Congress, we will live with exactly these parameters.","[INTERVIEWED]. I think there would be—I think it would make perfect sense for us to make the public option available to Federal employees as well. But keep in mind, it would just be a choice.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Understood. Let me keep moving, if I may. Tracy listens on WXNT News Talk 1430 in Indianapolis. Tracy, your question for [INTERVIEWED].","Health Care for Illegal Immigrants/The President's Health Care Reform Priorities","[INTERVIEWER2]. [INTERVIEWED], thanks for taking my call.","[INTERVIEWED]. Hi, Tracy.","[INTERVIEWER2]. Hi. Until I heard you say that a private option is just a sliver of your health care proposal recently, I think myself and many Americans thought that pretty much was your proposal.","[INTERVIEWED]. I know.","[INTERVIEWER2]. So my question is, could you please quickly list five or six bullet points of what legislation must include for you to be willing to sign it? For instance, employer mandates, tort reform, illegal immigrants, what about them? Must it include a public option?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'd be happy to. First of all, you mentioned illegal immigrants. This has been an example of just pure misinformation out there. None of the bills that have been voted on in Congress and none of the proposals coming out of the White House propose giving coverage to illegal immigrants—none of them. That has never been on the table; nobody has discussed it. So everybody who is listening out there, when you start hearing that somehow this is all designed to provide health insurance to illegal immigrants, that is simply not true and has never been the case.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What is their fate, if I might ask? Because there's a 1986 law on the book that says if you show up at an ER, you've got to be treated.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that will continue, because we don't want a situation in which some child, even if they're an illegal immigrant, shows up in an emergency room with tuberculosis and nobody is giving them treatment, and then they're going back to the playground and playing next to our kids.","So there—I think there is a basic standard of decency where if somebody is in a death situation or a severe illness, that we're going to provide them emergency care. But nobody has talked about providing health insurance to illegal immigrants. I want to make that absolutely clear.","Now, Tracy, you had a good point about what are the bullet points that I want. Number one, it's got to be deficit neutral. This has to be paid for, because in the past, some of the health care plans that we've put forward have not been paid for. A good example of this was the prescription drug benefit for seniors. That was a important thing to do, but we never actually figured out how to pay for it. That just went directly into the deficit and the national debt. We can't afford to do that. So that would be point number one.","Point number two, it has to bend the cost curve. What that means is that we've got to create a plan that experts credibly say will reduce health care inflation, because if all we're doing is adding more people, but we're not controlling costs, that will blow up the deficit over the long term, and it will blow up the burdens on individual families and businesses. We've got to get control of our costs. We spend $6,000 more than any other advanced country per person on health care. That's number two.","Number three, we've got to have the insurance reforms I talked about for people who already have health insurance. And that means making sure you can get health insurance even if you've got a preexisting condition, making sure that you're not burdened by lifetime caps, making sure that insurance companies can't drop you just because you get sick or because you're older or because you're not as healthy; so making sure that there are basic insurance protections, that's very important.","Number four is I want to make sure that we have a health exchange, as I just described, that is similar to what Members of Congress have, where you will have a set of options. If you're a small business, if you're an individual, self-employed, you have trouble getting health insurance right now, you can go and look at a bunch of options. And we've got to make it affordable for middle class families, so part of the plan has to be that if you can't afford a market-based premium, that we're giving you a little bit of help and you're able to get health insurance.","Choice, competition, reducing costs—those are the things that I want to see accomplished in this health reform bill.","Personal Responsibility for Health","[INTERVIEWER1]. Where, [INTERVIEWED], does personal responsibility factor into all this? There was a front-page story in USA Today recently that talked about obesity being the single most significant factor. I mean, you're a fit guy. How about rewarding those who get on a StairMaster every day?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the interesting thing is, you're already starting to see this happen among a lot of private companies. Safeway, for example, is a company that has done a great job in helping encourage its employees to get fit, and they actually give them an incentive. They say, \"Look, we're—you're going to save X amount on your insurance premiums; you'll see that in your paycheck if you are taking steps to take care of yourself.\" And I think that creating incentives like that for prevention, for wellness, creating cash incentives for people who—where it shows up they're saving money on their health insurance because of it, I think that's something that should be part of this.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], Joe listens to me at Home Base, which is the Big Talker 1210 in Philadelphia. Joseph, go ahead for the President of the United States.","Bipartisan Cooperation on Health Care Reform","[INTERVIEWER2]. Thank you for taking my call, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Hey, Joe, how are you?","[INTERVIEWER2]. Oh, I'm scared out of my mind talking to you here. [Laughter] I'm a supporter, worked hard for you last year.","The President. I appreciate you.","[INTERVIEWER2]. And I'm getting a little ticked off that it feels like the knees are buckling a little bit. You have an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate, and you own the whole shooting match. And I'm just not getting—it's very frustrating to watch you try and compromise with a lot of these people who aren't willing to compromise with you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Are your knees buckling? That's his question.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I guarantee you, Joe, we are going to get health care reform done. And I know that there are a lot of people out there who have been hand-wringing, and folks in the press are following every little twist and turn of the legislative process. You know, passing a big bill like this is always messy. It's—FDR was called a socialist when he passed Social Security. JFK and Lyndon Johnson, they were both accused of a Government takeover of health care when they passed Medicare. This is the process that we go through, because, understandably, the American people have a long tradition of being suspicious of government until the government actually does something that helps them, and then they don't want anybody messing with whatever gets set up.","And I'm confident we're going to get it done, and as far as negotiations with Republicans, my attitude has always been, let's see if we can get this done with some consensus. I would love to have more Republicans engaged and involved in this process. I think early on a decision was made by the Republican leadership that said, \"Look, let's not give them a victory, and maybe we can have a replay of 1993, '94 when Clinton came in. He failed on health care, and then we won in the midterm elections, and we got the majority.\" And I think there's some folks who are taking a page out of that playbook.","But this is—shouldn't be a political issue. This is a issue for the American people. There are a bunch of Republicans out there who have been working very constructively. One of them, Olympia Snowe in Maine, she's been dedicated on this. Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi, others—they've been meeting in the Senate Finance Committee. I want to give them a chance to work through these processes.","And we're happy to make sensible compromises. What we're not willing to do is give up on the core principle that Americans who don't have health insurance should get it, that Americans who do have health insurance should get a better deal from insurance companies and have consumer protections. We've got to reduce health care inflation so that everybody can keep the health care that they have. That's going to be my priorities, and I think we can get it done.","Release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi","[INTERVIEWER1]. A bit off message, today the Scots released the Lockerbie bomber due to—actually, maybe it is health care-related. He's got terminal cancer. Your take on this—a lot of folks very offended over a perceived lack of justice.","[INTERVIEWED]. We have been in contact with the Scottish Government indicating that we objected to this, and we thought it was a mistake. We're now in contact with the Libyan Government, and want to make sure that if in fact this transfer has taken place, that he's not welcomed back in some way, but instead should be under house arrest. We've also, obviously, been in contact with the families of the Pan Am victims and indicated to them that we don't think this was appropriate.","Afghanistan/Pakistan","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], in each of our prior three conversations, I spoke with you extensively about the need for closure, and we agreed relative to bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. And as a matter of fact—and this is well documented; I've written and spoken about it extensively—things that you said during the course of the campaign played a critical role in my personal decisionmaking pertaining to the 2008 election. So I feel I'd be derelict in my duty if I didn't come here today and say, where are we? I know we had a major victory recently with the number-one individual for the Taliban in those tribal regions. But pertaining to bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri, where is it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, here's where we're at. We are continuing to ramp up the pressure in Afghanistan. And we had a—what appears to be a successful election in Afghanistan despite the Taliban's effort to disrupt it. You've got General McChrystal now over there and more troops who are putting pressure on the eastern and southern portions of Afghanistan.","On the other hand, you've got the Pakistani Army for the first time actually fighting in a very aggressive way, and that's how we took out Baitullah Mehsud——","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. ——the top Taliban leader in Pakistan, who was also one of bin Laden's key allies. So the goal here is essentially to have a pincer, where we are squeezing them on both sides. We're eliminating their allies. It's making it more difficult for them to communicate, making it more difficult for them to operate safe havens, and over time, what we hope to do is to flush them out. We are going to keep on putting pressure on them, and I know that it's at great cost. I mean, I have to sign letters to family members who have fallen, and a lot more are falling in Afghanistan than in Iraq. And as a consequence, we've got to make sure that we are really focused on finishing the job in Afghanistan, but it's going to take some time.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], Susan listens to WOR News Radio 710 in New York City. Susan, go ahead for the President of the United States.","Q. Yes, thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED], for talking to us directly about this important issue.","Health Care Reform at the State Level","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, Susan.","Q. We all want reform. I guess it's really a matter of what the best solution is. And a lot of us feel that the Federal Government is just not equipped or it's their role to be getting involved in delivering health care services. And we're very concerned that most of the money will actually go—instead of taking care of people, it will go to, you know, the cost of administering a huge Government bureaucracy. Why not do something more like giving incentives to the States? Like here in New York, we already have free health care for people who can't afford it. And you know, it should only be for people who can't afford it, not for the 20- and 30-somethings that choose to spend their money on SUVs and the latest electronic gadgets. And it's not free, because we all know that we're going to be paying for it, and it should be only for the people who can't really afford it. And we want to have our own health care decisions locally, and we don't want the Federal Government making those decisions for us.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is there a State solution here, [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, first of all, Susan, I think that it's important to understand that part of the health reform proposal that we've put forward would involve the States. The States, in some cases, would be empowered to expand Medicaid to cover more people the same way that they've been able to cover more children under the Children's Health Insurance Program. So a sizable portion of the people who are currently uninsured would in fact be getting their insurance through the States. That's how the current Medicaid program is able to allow States to cover more people.","Keep in mind that nobody is talking about the Government administering all of health care. What we're talking about here is a public option that people could sign up for, but in that situation, they'd have to operate like any private insurer. They'd have to be collecting premiums and so forth.","The track record for Government administering health care actually is surprisingly good. Medicare, for example, a Government program, has much lower administrative costs than private insurers do. Now, part of it is, is because they don't have—either somebody is qualified or they're not, and so signing them up is a lot more automatic.","But that points to one of the big problems that we have. In private insurance, huge amounts of insurance companies are spending a lot of money and a lot of effort and a lot of staff just trying to cherry-pick people who are healthy and sign them up and then eliminate people who are sick. And part of what we want to do here is just reform the system so that insurance companies are operating more fairly to all people.","If you're young, actually, it's easier to get health insurance these days. The really tough population are folks who are from 50 to 64. Maybe they just got laid off. Maybe they're self-employed. They have a whale of a time trying to buy health insurance, and we want to make sure that there is a market for them.","Last point that I would make is that, you mention the fact that a lot of young people opt out. One of the things that we would do under reform is to say, if you want, you can stay on your health insurance—or your parents' health insurance up to the age of 26. That would cover a lot of young people who they—fall in that gap. Their first job doesn't necessarily offer them insurance. It gives them a way of having coverage until they get that job that has a little bit more security.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You're needed across town. I appreciate very much the privilege of coming to the White House. [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much for being on the Michael Smerconish program.","[INTERVIEWED]. Mike, it's always a pleasure. And I want to thank all your listeners, terrific questions. There's a great dialogue that takes place on this show, and I just hope that we can continue that dialogue in the same spirit to solve some of America's big problems.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. I'll be back in just a moment from the White House."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmiddleeasternjournalists","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. I wanted to just say a word of welcome to you all, and be glad to thank you for coming all this way. I think the best thing is just to go ahead and start, though I might say at the beginning that the coalition that was put together to stand up against the aggression has been, in my view, historic. There were a lot of predictions early on that one or another country would pull away or that it would fracture in some and you come to me on a day when I have great gratitude in my heart to the leaders of the coalition countries. Well, I guess all the countries from which you've come having had forces there Morocco, of course, in a special role, not a part of the coalition per se but nevertheless in the defense of Saudi Arabia, having some soldiers on the ground. That's a distinction that I wanted to say to you, sir, we understand and respect.","But in any event, those forces that did end up in the battle did very well. There were predictions that some might not want to engage in the battle, and they did, and so we are very grateful. And I keep saying two things: One, this is not a U.S. effort by itself. And secondly, our argument was never with the people of Iraq; it was with Saddam Hussein.","I make this point because the Iraqis tried to make it them I mean \"them\" including all Arabs against the United States. And I will resist that until time immemorial, because there's a feeling of gratitude and affection to the Arab world because so many there stood with us against this evil.","But now, look, I came to answer your questions, and I'll try to do so. Who wants to go first?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, my colleagues have elected that I speak first. I would like to take the opportunity to thank you personally, the administration and this great country and people, for what you have done. I believe this is an historical stand. And as our Ambassador has said, you will go into history as a great leader and a great man.","Sir, my first question is, the coalition has won the war, and I believe we have a great battle ahead of us, that is, to win the peace. What kind of arrangement do you foresee the United States, the coalition, and the Gulf States and, of course, the Arabs would have for security arrangements within the Gulf States and the Arab States?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think this is a time, as Abraham Lincoln once said in our history, to think anew. And we are starting to think anew by dispatching our Secretary of State to the region. There will not be a United States plan to bring peace to Lebanon, to the Gulf, or to the Israeli-Palestine question. There will not be a single, sole U.S. plan. We want to be an instrumental part of it. We think, given what's happened in the Gulf, perhaps we have more credibility to be a part of it. When I spoke at our meeting to the joint session of Congress the other day, I spoke about our interest in being a catalyst for peace. And that's what Baker is out there to do.","I would love to think that the day would come when the Israeli-Arab world hostility could end. And that's going to take compromise on both sides. We are very openminded as to how that should be brought about. When I talked about territory for peace, that wasn't exactly a new statement. We have been proponents of Resolutions 242 and 338 for a long time, and so have other countries, many other countries. I'd say most every country, but then some have pulled away from them. So, we're going to push, after consultation, in trying to get common ground with our coalition partners and then with Israel and others, to push on all three fronts.","Obviously, the security in the Gulf is quite different. I will repeat I don't want to lecture here, but I will repeat that we are not interested in a longterm ground troop presence. The Iranians, for example, are accusing us, or not accusing us but are very much concerned about that. So are others. And we would be playing right into the hands of our critics if we sent a signal that we wanted to leave a sizable U.S. force on the ground out there. We don't. Our families want them home.","But on the other hand, I spelled out the other day some security requirements for the Gulf and what we think might be new arrangements that will provide for a more stable and more secure Gulf. Lebanon, again, and the Israeli question these will be evolved after the Baker consultations.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], President Mubarak has called once again for a Middle East, including Israel, free of weapons of mass destruction. Do you agree with this initiative and other proposals for the limitation of arms shipments to the region, including Israel?","[INTERVIEWED]. You heard me speak on proliferation. I don't think you're going to disarm Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria anybody. I think that's idealistic. I'm not implying that that what my dear friend Hosni Mubarak is saying. But I would like to think that out of all this we could have a vastly reduced flow of arms to this troubled corner of the world.","We have been very much concerned about these shipments. In some places we've been involved in them, to many of the countries right here in which your papers are located and Israel. But when I made this pitch for nonproliferation the other day, it is something that again we want to talk about within this whole concept of security and stability, not of just the Gulf region but of the other parts of the Middle East as well.","So, I'm not certain how we'll come down, what the final arrangements will be, but we are very openminded about talking and then doing what we say after we talk, in terms of fewer weapons going into the area.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], do you foresee any future role for Iraq and Iran in the security arrangement?","[INTERVIEWED]. Roles for Iraq and Iran? Well, in the first place, we never have felt that it was in the interest of the Gulf or certainly of the United States to create a vacuum in Iraq. And we have not wanted an unstable Iraq. Iraq has a job to do of reconstruction. And what they ought to do is have a government that will signal to the rest of the world that they want to live within their own borders, that they are renouncing aggression. And indeed, they did renounce the annexation of what they used to arrogantly refer to as Province 19.","So, they've got to send the signal to the world that they want to live within what we call the family of peace-loving nations. That is difficult, very candidly, for us. And one of the things Baker will talk about with our partners is whether it's difficult for them if Saddam Hussein remains in power. So, Iraq we want to see stable, living within its own borders with respect for its neighbors, renouncing its so-called claim to Kuwait, and yes, being an important part of the area.","Iraq can be a very well-to-do country if they'd spend their money on helping their own people and not on arms and bullying the neighborhood, which they tried to do until they got into the war with Iran. Then the man changed his spots momentarily. Then when that war was over, he showed his arrogance and bullying again by going after Kuwait.","So, the best answer, as we see it and again, with respect for our partners, I want to know exactly what they think but is for Iraq to live in its borders, and then it can regain the respect that they deserve. They've got a proud history. They've got culture. They've got religious traditions and all. So, we're open to that. But it's going to be difficult under the status quo.","On Iran, we've had very strained relations with Iran. I have publicly said, and I'll repeat it this is a unique chance to repeat it here we want better relations with Iran. We have no animosity. There's a lot of feeling in our country about our hostages and about the Embassy, and there's feelings in Iran about the shooting down, which was pure accident, of the airbus and all of this. But sometimes when you have deep divisions it takes a little more time. So, we're not pressing Iran on bilateral relations.","But Iran is a big country. I don't think they should be treated forever as enemies by all the countries out in the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] countries or others. And I don't think, as I listen carefully to our friends in the Gulf I think there's an evolution process here towards Iran. And as Iran moves to what I hope will be a more moderate or a less radical role, I think that the other countries in the area will welcome them back.","But they're an important country and they've got a self-respect. And so, we'd like to find ways to recognize that of self-respect and their own sovereignty, of course. But we've got some bilateral problems.","So, I think both of them, being of their size, of their economic potential, of their historic standing, have key roles to play in a secure and stable Gulf. But again, it's got to evolve how that will work, I mean, what mechanics are worked out. Will there be an Arab peacekeeping force there, and can that be presented to all the countries as no threat to them, but as a guarantee of the security of other countries?","So, we want this remember in the early days of all this, talk about \"Arab solution\" King Hussein kept talking about, \"We want an Arab solution.\" And they had meetings and others saying \"Arab,\" and we understood that. We don't want a Yankee solution to the Middle East. [Laughter] I mean, that's not what we want.","So, here's a chance now for our friends in the Arab world and there are many, and I hope there are more than when all this started to say, look, here's where we should carry the ball; here's the place we should have the lead. And then we stand there with our, I would say, conviction backed up by perhaps a naval presence that I mentioned coming up and down the Gulf. It has helped with stability. And I see it as that kind of partnership in the future, but with no rancor in my heart about Iran, no rancor about the people of Iraq.","So, when I get up and say that here, I'm not just making it up. Because we hurt, we ache when we see a child that doesn't have enough food, or water that's contaminated, or something of that nature. And I think people in Saudi, Kuwait, Morocco they feel the same thing when they see an Iraqi child.","So, we've got to approach it in a magnanimous, compassionate way. But let our Arab friends stand out there and say: Here's what we recommend. Here's what we're prepared to do. And then have us willing to put our military and whatever they want behind this effort.","So, that one is easier, it seems to me, the Gulf security including Iran and Iraq, than perhaps Lebanon and the Palestine question as it relates to Israel.","I'm going on too long, but I want to make a point that we've been very disappointed in the PLO here. I mean, the PLO was anointed at Rabat years ago as the sole spokesmen in all of this, and they've been disappointing. They've moved way over too far in support of Saddam Hussein. They took a bet they bet this coalition wouldn't hold, and they bet the United States would not do what we did. And the guy bet wrong.","Here was a man that, in spite of the recent terrorist acts, had some standing in this country. I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but he's lost that standing here. And that isn't to mean that we say to everybody that was sympathetic to the PLO, hey, you're bad guys; that's not it. But they've been diminished by this.","So, their role in the security, at least for now, in my view, has been diminished because they bet on the wrong horse for the wrong reasons, the wrong motives. I mean, they did not stand up and condemn that aggression. And I think it has hurt some of the Palestinians in Kuwait who had been treated very well there. And then when the Kuwait thing happens, a lot of the Palestinians sided with the Iraqi invaders. Well, this didn't help their image around the United States. I can only speak for our country.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What do you mean by political rights to Palestinian people in your speech?","[INTERVIEWED]. About political rights? Listen, there will not be peace until the whole question of where the Palestinians have a right to be is taken care of. And some say \"state.\" It's not been our position in favor of the state, and there we differ with many of our Arab friends. But the question is, get the Palestine question resolved. And obviously, the framework has got to be the action taken by the United Nations. Or at least, that doesn't have to be the only answer, but that's some common ground there. That's something that Israel agreed to, that's something that Arab States agreed to, and is subject to a lot of interpretation problems. But there is a common place to start from. But there's got to be discussions. We can't have state of war forever and ever. I mean, we're in kind of a healing mode now. I'd like to heal some wounds. I'd like to be a catalyst that can help overcome old enmities.","Now, maybe that's too idealistic, but even if he can't do that, there has got to be a resolution of the Palestine question. And we know it, and we feel strongly about it, and we're prepared to play a useful role. But as I say, people are going to have to move on all sides of this question. The status quo ain't going to get the job done.","Q. You had a talk with the PLO; are you willing to resume the talks?","[INTERVIEWED]. I wouldn't say right now. They're coming at us at the wrong time. I don't think they've requested that. They were broken off because, as you recall, some terrorists what we call terrorism. They were calling it something else. But I think I would be very and I'm one who wanted to keep those talks going and did as long as we could. But to me, they've lost credibility. They've lost credibility with this office right here. And the reason they have is because they behaved very badly to those of their own fundamental faith.","That's not all PLO people; I'm sure there are some good people there. But their leadership betrayed their friends and got in with the wrong side. And it's going to take some time. So, I'm not in any rush to do that at all.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, excuse me. I have two points. The first is the immediate problems we are facing, and the other one is a medium-term. The first one is the environment. Now we have oil spillage and this fire.","The second one, sir, I am speaking I think the medium-range sort of problems in our region, to my mind, is democracy and development. What's your","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay. First, the environment. I have been surprised that in this country there has not been more of a highlighted moral outrage. I feel a moral outrage here. I feel that what he has done, laying waste to the assets of Kuwait, is brutal environmental terrorism. There is no excuse for it. There is no rationale for it. It is simply what we call the scorched earth policy, as he left. That is unacceptable.","I think world judgment is going to take a while to mature in this regard. People here hate it, but there isn't that visceral feeling about what this man has done. As time goes by and the shooting has stopped, thank God, and people come back into Kuwait as they are, thank heavens, I think people are more and more going to be outraged by it.","One of the reasons that we insisted on accountability and on one of the U.N. resolutions that called for compensation was because we felt so strongly about the environmental degradation. And Kuwait is entitled to compensation for this kind of environmental terrorism. And so are others who might be affected by that spill.","So, one, we're very much concerned about it, and I think it's going to be a focal point. It hasn't yet been as much as I thought it would be a focal point for indignation against this laying to waste, reckless laying to waste, of another country.","What was your second point?","[INTERVIEWER1]. Democracy and development.","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course, the United States, you know, we're for democracy. Obviously, the more democratic processes that are put into effect in whatever country, we rejoice in that. That's been the history of our country. We're not trying to dictate to some country how to do its internal affairs. But the more compatible the values, the better it is for the future. We urge as much democratic process as possible in the area and in all areas.","So, we just stand as a beacon, we think, for democracy, and we will continue to try to do it. As you know, halfway around the world I was criticized for not standing stronger for democracy in China. I thought I stood very strongly for it. But there's a balance here between expressing your own convictions about your own values and having respect for problems that others have.","So, on development, I think the resources are there. And if those resources can be turned to peaceful means, so not only a country that has valued peace take Kuwait but it has had to worry about whether it would be aggressed against or whether its neighbors were going to do something.","But if we can get this new order out there, then I think the means are there for the development of the entire region. But it isn't going to be done with the barrel of the gun. And you can't say to Saudi Arabia, to Kuwait, \"Hey, trust me, all is well, throw down your arms,\" as long as you have a situation in the Gulf that's unstable.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], one of the main reasons of instability in the region, originally in the Mideast, is the big gap between the rich and the poor countries. And recently, after the Gulf war, there have been many ideas proposed to tackle this problem. And I think Secretary Baker he once mentioned a sort of new international development bank for the Middle East or something like that. What are your ideas, [INTERVIEWED], I mean the U.S. ideas to deal with this problem?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't want to try to preempt the Baker trip. He's going out there to discuss economic development. And there are a lot of resources in the area. People look at the United States and say, hey, there's a lot of resources in the United States, too. And there are. But when we tried to assist Egypt with its rather substantial debt to the United States, you know I came under great attack here: Hey, wait a minute, what the hell are you doing worrying about Egypt's debt? What about Iowa and Kansas and Texas and other places in our own country? What about our budget deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars?","So, we are not in a great position to be putting ourselves up as the wealthy guy that can solve all the problems in other areas. But there are discrepancies in wealth in the area, just as there are in my own country. There are a lot of people here in poverty. Some people live very well. The same thing is true in the entire Middle East. But I think the way to work it out is through consultation and through planning and through regional answers to it. We can't dictate. We can't say to a wealthy country out there: Hey, you've got to spend x dollars to help your guy next door. I don't think that's the way. I mean, that would be really resented in that part of the world. Just as I would resent it if some wealthy countries in other parts, or Europe, for example, started telling me how to take care of poverty in the United States.","So, again I want to fall back on the Baker consultations, which will have this economic ingredient, this development ingredient as part of it. Having said that, I think all of us as human beings have to be concerned when there's a lot of inequity. And I feel it here. I don't get given any credit in this country for feeling it, but I do. I worry about it. And I certainly worry about it in other parts.","But to try to justify aggression on the basis of the haves versus the have nots is unacceptable. And I don't think we can ever permit that kind of demagogic rationalization to justify the takeover of one country by another. And I, to be honest with you on that point, I had never considered Iraq a have-not country. I've considered them a country that has tremendous resources that they splurged on trying to buy support with Mercedes-Benzes and arming themselves to the teeth so that they could bully the neighborhood. Well, those days are over and I'm damn proud that we had a part, working with our partners, in putting an end to it. I say they're over. They better be over, or Iraq will not have normalized relations with this country. I can speak for the U.S.","[INTERVIEWER1]. No, what I mean, it's not just to give. To help in development, because through development, this will have a solution for these problems.","[INTERVIEWED]. It would be a fantastic thing to do. No, excuse me, I wasn't lecturing you on the fact that we don't need development. I'm simply saying it is something that is going to have to be addressed, but that we can't use we can't permit one neighbor to take over another because he's doing it in the name of have or versus have not. But I think there's a wonderful chance now for economic development where one country will want to help another.","The United States has always been in that mode, and we'll want to try to help. All I'm saying is we're going to need  we're not going to pull back into some sphere of isolation as a result of all this. But once again, it's with respect that I say, hey, we need some regional answers out here. We need some Arab solutions. And let us be a part of it but not try to dictate it, is all I'm saying on development and on how we handle the inequities of wealth versus nonwealth.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], you talked about Iraq recently, and you said you are not going to pay any penny for rebuilding Iraq. What about if there is a new government of Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED]. What we're willing to do is immediately help in a humanitarian way. If there's a hungry child, if there's a sick family, we'll go there today; yesterday we'll be there. We've always done that. But as you look at the overall reconstruction of Iraq, what they need to do is come up with a plan where they use their wealth for their own reconstruction, and then be able to have a good life for their people from there on. They can do it. They've got enormous wealth.","And if they had a new government that had a broad futuristic view, that contained the willingness to live at peace with their neighbors, throw down these excessive arms what they've got left, keep what they need for their own internal security guarantee their neighbors they have nothing to fear from them, then of course we'd be willing, in a broad sense through these international agencies and others, to be helpful in terms of reconstruction.","But it is not the case where we are going to turn around as Uncle Sucker, not Uncle Sam but Uncle Sucker, and turn around and start sending taxpayers' money that are going to rebuild the arrogance that has led to this instability in the first place. And I'll tell you, the American people feel strongly about it. And there's 265 million of us, and nobody feels more strongly about it than the guy sitting right here.","We're not inhumane, but let's see the new government develop. Let's see them give the assurances to their neighbors they want to live at peace. Let's see them show the concern for their own people that they should have. And that means not spending it all on rifles from the Soviet Union or tanks, but it's on trying to help turn on those oil wells, get those going again, and help their people.","That's my point. That's what I was trying to say the other night. But everything takes time, too. This situation needs time. But the best thing that could happen is if the kind of government you asked about emerges; then you'd see whole new attitudes emerge in Europe and the United States and everyplace else.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What kind of government do you think that ought to be?","[INTERVIEWED]. One that is compassionate and concerned about his own people and drops all this arrogance about the neighborhood. That would be a good place to start. And I have known before the Iran-Iraq war I used to wrestle with these problems when I was at the United Nations. And these guys from other Arab countries have come up and told me this man's a bully. He'll walk into a room with other Arab leaders and swagger in with his bullying the neighbors. And he had muscle. He had arms, when some of them hadn't gone to the arms route. He had an arrogant swagger that tried to intimidate his Arab neighbors.","Then he got into the Iran-Iraq war and that changed, because he needed help. So, he turned to those against whom he'd been arrogant and showed a different side momentarily. Then that war ended. And what does he do? He brutalizes Kuwait. So, he can't have that kind of an attitude if he wants reasonable relations with us. And that's what I'm saying. We tried with Iraq. We tried just before the end of the Iran-Iraq war to have better relations and to see a different side. And what happens? He takes over Kuwait, and that was it right there. Bang that's enough for us.","And again, we're not the ones that are trying to dictate to that corner of the world. I've been out there. I have respect for the countries and their cultures and their traditions and for their sovereignty. And in this office, as long as I'm here, whether we have a big country or a small country, we are going to respect that. But I don't respect the bullying attitude that resulted now in the aggression against Kuwait.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, while we are on the point, do you envisage more sort of cooperation with the GCC themselves on","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I think as much as possible. And I think as more of a security arrangements as can be arranged for and taken over by the GCC, the better it is. It's their neighborhood. We've got a stake in it for a lot of reasons economic reasons and historic reasons but absolutely. And the more vital the GCC is, the more it can say here's what's best for the Gulf area, in my view, so much the better. And I'll keep using this thing here, the telephone, and talking to these leaders out there. And we're going to keep up good bilateral relations with as many countries as possible. But the needs are regional; it's crying out for a regional answer to it.","The complex problems that you ask about are a little different. It's not strictly regional. It's more global in a sense because it's been so intractable.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, [INTERVIEWED]","Mr. Fitzwater. We're going to have to break, gentlemen.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The last question.","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me and then I'll try not to lecture you so much. I get all I'm very enthusiastic about this. I remember being back as Ambassador at the United Nations. And I didn't know as much about diplomacy then, but I became very close to the Ambassadors from the Arab world. The day I left, they gave a beautiful going-away party, in spite of the fact that we had stood against them or at least they thought, against them on some of the Israel questions. I'll never forget it.","And Bishara, who is the head of the GCC he was the Kuwait Ambassador at that time. Through not only contact with him but remember the guy Baroody really Lebanese and they became close friends, and they taught me a lot about the individual traditions of the countries. Abdel Meguid was my colleague at the U.N. So when I sit down and talk to Mubarak, I've been conditioned and sensitized by these friends of mine in that area. And I want to reflect my feeling about these countries through how we conduct ourselves.","One of the things that made it easier for us to commit an enormous amount of treasure and risk a lot of human life was that we feel this area and its importance more than, I think, perhaps some of my predecessors. That doesn't mean we're not going to have fights with representatives from the various countries represented here. But we don't want to do it out of neglect or out of failing to understand the intense pride of the region.","Now, what was the question?","Q. Sir, I do think that everybody in Kuwait and a lot of people in the GCC and their countries look to Mr. George Bush as a great man. And this is the first time in history I have seen so many articles about the United States, about Mr. George Bush being published, not clandestinely like you were before, but now everything is open. What kind of relations do you envisage between this country and the Gulf GCC?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, again, I think it has to be one of mutual respect. I think it has to be one who fiercely recognizes and is willing to defend the territorial integrity of the country. I think it has to be one where we're forward-leaning on the peace process as it relates to Israel and Palestine. Because in these countries, no matter how good our bilateral relations, there's this feeling hey, you ought to be doing more about that question.","I see it as one where we will be tested by whether I am willing to do what we've said, be a catalyst for peace not just in the Gulf but up into Lebanon and down into the Israeli-Palestine question.","But what I hope will happen is that because of the commitment we made, after great consultation in your country's case, the Amir; the case of the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia], with King Fahd himself; a close relationship with Mubarak I hope that the United States will and I think it is true in Morocco, although we had a little different standing for Morocco in this I hope that there will be a recognition that we're credible friends. And this is an important point, that we have credibility. When we say we'll do something, we'll do it; we mean it.","And that is an important point as to how the U.S. interacts with the Middle East from now on, it seems to me. If they say they're going to do what they say they'll do, I think that is important. I think a lot of lip service was given to that point, but for various reasons, including global reasons, Vietnam. People would  \"Look, hey, do they really mean this? Are they really going to follow through?\" And I think that our credibility should be such in the area that we can work closely now as credible allies, credible friends.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], the Gulf war is the first of its kind to take place in the context of the new world order. How did the new world order influence the way the world dealt with this crisis? And what is the main lesson learned from the Gulf war?","[INTERVIEWED]. The new world order said that a lot of countries, disparate backgrounds, with differences, can come together standing for a common principle. And that principle is: You don't take over another country by force. So, the new world order, to the degree it's emerged so far, has been enhanced by this single concept that we're going to unite, no matter what other differences we may have had, what the bilateral problems may have been, and we're going to stand up against aggression.","It was enhanced by a more viable United Nations, a United Nations where the big powers didn't automatically go against each other. In the cold war days, we'd say, \"This is black,\" and the Soviets would say, \"Hey, that's white.\" And you'd have a veto, and nothing would happen. And the peacekeeping dreams of the founders of the U.N. were dashed.","So, part of this new world order has been moved forward by a United Nations that functioned. We might have still been able to stand up and come to the assistance of Kuwait the United States. I might have said, \"To hell with them. It's right and wrong. It's good and evil. He's evil; our cause is right,\" and, without the United Nations, sent a considerable force to help. But it was an enhanced it is far better to have this collective action where the world, not just the Security Council but the whole General Assembly, stood up and condemned it.","So, part of it is these more viable international organizations. And that is where we are now. Then how we build on it is the questions that will be coming up, trying to give our share of the answers when Jim Baker comes back from these consultations.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And what is the lesson which we learned from this crisis?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the one key lesson is: Aggression will not stand. You don't bully your neighbor. You don't swagger around the neighborhood with an arrogance and back it up by overwhelming force without paying a price. Same thing you learned in the school yard when you were over there in Egypt. One guy came out and tried to beat the hell out of you when you're in the third grade, and you'd wait for a while, and then somebody would hit him and he'd go back into his shell and he wouldn't do it again. And that is what happened in this case. Same thing.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], I am too greedy. I want to make two questions.","[INTERVIEWED]. You've got it. [Laughter] They have another way of doing it over here, saying \"and a followup,\" you know. They'll ask you something unrelated and call it a followup so they can get two.","Syria-U.S. Relations","[INTERVIEWER1]. You made a step toward Syria and a good relationship with them. How do you see now the relation between the United States and Syria regarding Lebanon, especially?","[INTERVIEWED]. We've had some differences with Syria that we have spoken very frankly about regarding terrorism and other things. I think that because we were able to work together with Syria here and we did this there was a lot of advice coming from other coalition partners that encouraged me to take additional steps toward Syria. Because of that I think we have a much better chance to work with them toward peace in Lebanon.","Syria has interests there. We're not saying they have no interests there. But these Taif accords are still valid, and the steps that the Arab leaders took there in terms of getting all forces out and democratization or better representation in the government inside Lebanon, those are good things.","But I think the key point to your question is, because we worked together on this one problem over here, the Gulf, and some doubts about each other were kind of laid to rest, we have a chance now to work toward the solution of other problems. And you know, they are very we have said very intractable on the Israeli question, and they have said we have been overly one-sided. At least we're talking. And at least they did what they said they'd do, and we did what we said we'd do.","And so, I think in terms of Lebanon, we've got a window  we've got a big door we can walk in, not a window but a door, where we can openly discuss things in a much better way. I know I feel that way about relations there. I think our Secretary of State does. And still, I don't want to suggest we have no problems with Syria or any other country. But we can talk about them more frankly without the door being slammed. And that can help Lebanon, that can help it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How do you see, [INTERVIEWED], your relation with so-called Arabic-solution states?","[INTERVIEWED]. Good, and better. It depends who you mean. Morocco was an Arab-solution state, and I feel very respectful of and friendship toward His Majesty the King [Hassan II]. I mean, that wasn't strained by this. You've got a problem if you're referring to Jordan.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The Amman incident.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, Amman. Let it cool down here, calm, take a little time. A little hurt feelings out there, disappointment in the United States still there; but a recognition that a stable Jordan is in everybody's interests. And I don't want to I mean, a lot of what happened in the Jordan situation was aimed not just against the United States but some of the other neighbors in the area.","And when that happens, I'd like to know how they feel. I'd like to know how King Fahd or Hosni Mubarak feels or how the Kuwaitis' Amir feels about Jordan and we can help. I mean, we've had a good relationship with the Hashemite King [Hussein I]. But I've expressed my public disappointment because I think Jordan has swung way over on this question. And I'm not saying it was all his fault because there were some people out there in the streets. And they're still out there yelling about me, personally, and the whole United States. Obviously I'm just this target for that.","But my view is, hey, we've all got to live together in peace, so let's take a little time now and sort this one out. We don't want to see a radicalized Jordan, and yet I must confess to a certain disappointment in terms of how that Jordanian question will I'm disappointed with some of the Jordan press, frankly, that did nothing but blame everything on the United States. They know better than that. And yet they did it.","But I've learned in life maybe it's because I'm 66 now take a little time, let it simmer, and then let's try to put together a more peaceful Middle East.","So, I have no rancor or bitterness. But, again, there is an area let the Arabs work their magic out here. You're talking about an Arab solution. Let them come to me and say, all of them, including Jordan: Here's the way we ought to work together. And not us try to dictate, to say to King Fahd, hey, you've got to do this. He wouldn't do it anyway. He's a strong-willed person, knows the area.","So, my answer: disappointment. Determination to think that one day we'll have a better relationship with a country with whom we've always had a good relationship, try to recognize their problems. But it's going to take time. There is some hurt here, some hurt in the neighborhood; there is some damage to a bilateral relationship.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], what is your message to the Arab people?","[INTERVIEWED]. A positive signal to the Arab people and that our argument has never been with the Arab people, per se. And I hope that our participation in this coalition and, if I could move one step forward, our leadership of the coalition was not aimed against an Arab of any kind. It was aimed in favor of a principle. And that principle, again: You don't take over your neighbor by force.","So, I see some demonstrations in various countries against my country, and I have a hurt about that. I guess every American loves to be loved, you know, around the world. But it doesn't work that way. And yet, I think some of the accusations by fundamentalists against us are very untrue, and I will stand up against them.","But I think the message, it shouldn't be one of recrimination: \"Hey, we remember what you said; we're going to get even.\" It ought to be: \"Look, we tried to stand for what we think was decent and right. We tried to stand with respect for principles in the Arab world. We tried in the targeting of Iraq to be respectful of their culture, archeological, religious, whatever.\" And our argument isn't with Islam; our argument isn't with Arabs. And I will stand up against any discrimination against Arabs in this country publicly, openly we've had groups in here and say, \"Damn it, we hurt when you hurt.\" But what we stood for was something positive. And I want to keep trying in every way possible to get that message across. And it was a positive point about which many Arabs can rally.","And I'm not a student of religion, but I don't find anything in what the principal teachings of Islam that put us in contradiction at all. In fact, the principles are the same as what we have a diverse religious culture. But it's kindness, it's be good to your neighbor, it's love, and it's take care of children. It's all these things that so there's no anti-Islam. There is no anti-Arab. Our role is trying to be positive. And when it's said to me, \"The Arab world will turn against you,\" I never believed it for a minute. And I don't have any rancor when I see some. But if they assign motives to my country that are not correct, then I'm going to fight, stand up, and say, wait a minute, you're wrong. And we've got some healing to do, but we also have some convincing to do.","[INTERVIEWER1]. By the way, [INTERVIEWED], one of the relatives of the Egyptian soldiers was a Christian, and he arrived in Kuwait.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And President Mubarak ordered a special flight to get him because all the Moslems were buried in Saudi Arabia. But he's a Christian, he was buried in Egypt, and President Mubarak sent up a private flight to get him back home.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], what's the most difficult moment you've been through since the crisis?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we had some difficult ones internally here. And one of them was our press was saying I had not convinced the American people that what we were doing as an administration was right. And Marlin was in on that, General Scowcroft, Bob Gates  we were all in that together.","[INTERVIEWED]. And then I'd say the Congress. It was argued I can't go to war without the Congress. And I was saying, I have the authority to do this. We had lawyers. But once Congress acted affirmatively, it became much clearer to the American people. And so, that moment as we were getting down to a congressional vote was a very big one.","I don't think we ever had any real fundamental differences with the Arab world once we started I mean, with the coalition.","I'm probably forgetting something, but I can't remember exactly.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How about the Soviets?","[INTERVIEWED]. The uncertainty of August. Well, the Soviets stayed with us at the U.N. And so, at the end, when they started saying here's a peace plan, we knew what we had to do. And I did not assign to them the motives that many of our countrymen did, that Gorbachev was playing mischief because he was being left out. I really think he wanted to stop short of more killing well, I'm going to feel that way. Others disagree with me here. But I don't think it was ever a crisis because we knew what we had to do.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I see.","[INTERVIEWED]. Now, if he'd have stood up and said, if you do that we're going to blast you, and we're going to lead the Third World in opposition he could have done that.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. And he didn't do that. So, it could have been a problem, but he conducted himself in that case very well. He tried for peace, what he thought was a fair peace, a peace within keeping of the U.N. resolution. I was telling him: \"No, it is not, President Gorbachev, it is not. Stops short; there are conditions. And we've come a long way; we can't accept conditions.\"","But it never got to be I wouldn't say that one got to be it had a potential of a stumbling block, but it didn't really get there. And then I guess the major, not bump in the road but decision on our part was, what happens when you commit your young people to war? How many are going to be killed? There was a picture in Life magazine, 50,000 graves dug. Argument in this country used against me, of us, was body bags. That's a horrible image to people across our country. You're going to put my son in a body bag to fight for a country halfway around the world? So, the actual commitment of force, whether it was first the air, then the ground, from the U.S. standpoint was an important decision.","Again, we knew we had to do this. We've committed to do this. But the timing presented a problem and all of that. But on balance, though, it went, I think, fairly smoothly.","[INTERVIEWER1]. It's over.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's over, thank God."," "]}

[INTERVIEWED], it's not an easy thing to interview [INTERVIEWED] of the most powerful state on—in the world. However, what is more difficult is to size down your questions to fit in the minutes.","[INTERVIEWED]. In the timeframe. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yes. My first question is, people in Egypt, sometimes they get confused. On one hand, they hear the U.S. statements, speeches that stress on the long-lasting relationships with Egypt, the strategic importance of Egypt to the U.S. and to the Middle East, Egypt as the major player in the peace process. On the other hand, they could see indications that contradicts with this: U.S. depending on other parties in the region, your snatching visit to Sharm el-Sheikh last January, the partial cutting of the U.S. aid. How would you comment on that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. I would comment this, that from my perspective, the Egyptian-U.S. relationship is a very important part of our Middle Eastern foreign policy, for these reasons: One, Egypt has got a proud history and a great tradition, and a lot of people look to Egypt for help.","Now, the United States can't solve a lot of problems on our own, has to have allies be a part of it. And so on the Palestinian issue, for example, Egypt can be very constructive and has been constructive and helpful. Egypt has got a society that honors diversity and gives people a chance to realize their talents, like you. I mean, you're a very smart, capable professional woman who has showed the rest of the Middle East what's possible in the Middle East. And Egypt has been on the forefront of modernization. Egypt is a—strategically located.","And so our relationship is strong and good. We've had our differences—on elections, for example. But nevertheless, to answer your question, I would say the relationship is very solid and very important.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Then how would you perceive the state of democracy in Egypt?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would say, fits and starts; good news and bad news. In other words, there's been some moments where it looked like Egypt was going to continue to lead the Middle East on the democracy movement, and there's been some setbacks. But I guess that just reflects the nature of the administration and their—on the one hand, their desire for democracy; on the other hand, their concerns about different movements. My view is, is that democracy is a powerful engine for reform and change and leads to peace.","[INTERVIEWER1]. But the public opinion— sometimes they perceive the U.S. criticism to the development of democracy in Egypt as an unacceptable intervention in the internal affairs.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I can understand that. Look, nobody wants the big, influential guy to come from the outside and tell them what to do. I'm sensitive to that. On the other hand, I do believe it's important for a leader in a country to adhere to certain values, universal values. I think the idea of giving people a chance to vote and a chance to participate freely in society is a universal value. And so it's—I try to balance, on the one hand, my beliefs, and on the other hand, a friendship with the Government and friendship with President Mubarak.","[INTERVIEWER1]. It's a matter of hours, and you will be in Tel Aviv celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. This celebration might be perceived by Palestinians and Arabs like— it is criticized, because it's ignoring the flip side, which is the 60 years of agony, pain, and struggle in the area, in the region. What would you tell Palestinians and Arab concerning this?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am going to talk to the Palestinians face to face when I come to Sharm el-Sheikh. And I will say that there's been 60 years of struggling on both sides, and it's time that the struggle has got to end. And now for—is the time for the development of a Palestinian state that has got defined borders, that doesn't look like Swiss cheese; in other words, it's contiguous territory, where the refugee issue is dealt with. And that's what my message is, is that I'm going to—I fully recognize the agony and pain that have been lived by everybody in the region, and that here's one way forward. And it's a—and we will continue to work, and hopefully, by the end of my Presidency, we'll get the definition of a state. And so I'll talk to President Mubarak about how we can work together.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Is this—some people would consider this as getting the ceiling lower and lower. Before, you said this—your administration will witness the declaration of the Palestinian state. Now we are talking about only the definition of the state.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, no, it's always been the definition, cause I always said that the state won't come into being until certain obligations are met through the roadmap. And so the whole purpose was to define— it's a semantical difference, but I really haven't changed my position.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Former President Jimmy Carter was in Cairo weeks ago, and he was really trying to tell how he was seeing things. He said with a simple comparison between the victims from the Israeli side and the Palestinian side, you can see who is suffering more.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Well, everybody has got their opinions. I just happen to believe that I'm in a position to help move the definition of a state, which will help solve the problem in the long run. I'm the first President ever to have articulated a two-state solution, two states living side by side in peace. And my only thing I want to tell your listeners is that I'm going to drive hard, along with Secretary Rice and other people in my administration, to see if we can't get the Palestinians and Israelis to agree on what that state will look like.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], do you still believe that who's not with us is against us?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Yes, in the war on terror, I do. Yes. When you kill innocent people to achieve political objectives, I think they're against civilized people. We've witnessed this kind of ideological——","[INTERVIEWER1]. But minutes ago, you said we have differences. We have——","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course, we have differences.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——it's normal to have differences.","[INTERVIEWED]. It is, but killing people to achieve political objectives is—it's one thing to have differences of opinion, it's another thing to have differences of action. And my comments about that—what—the line you just quoted was in the context of dealing with these extremists, like Al Qaida or Hamas, who just murder innocent people. And, yes, I still feel very strongly about that. Most people don't believe in using murder as a political tool. Most people want to live in peace, and so do I.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I have only just a chance for one question.","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You will be in the region very soon: Israel, Saudi Arabia, and then Egypt. The question is, maybe there are 250 million Arabs who think that President Bush has added to their sufferings and problems during his administration. How would you adjudicate this?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would just ask them to wait for history to answer the question. There's an advent of a young democracy in Iraq. Ask those people what it's like to live under a freer society, rather than the thumb of a tyrant or a dictator; or the people that we're trying to help in Lebanon by getting the Syrians out through a U.N. Security Council resolution; or the Palestinians who—for whom I've articulated a state.","In other words, I understand people's opinions. All I ask is that when history is finally recorded, judge whether or not I've been a contributor to peace or not.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You think history will be in your side?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think history will say, George Bush clearly saw the threats that keep the Middle East in turmoil and was willing to do something about it, was willing to lead, and had this great faith in the capacity of democracies and the great faith in the capacity of people to decide the fate of their countries; and that the democracy movement gained impetus and gained movement in the Middle East. Yes, I think people will say, \"Well, he had a difficult set of circumstances to deal with, and he dealt with them with a sense of idealism.\"","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you for this interview.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, thanks for coming."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmonicamalpassactionnews","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], given the 30 history of mistrust with Iran, how can you be certain they'll comply with this agreement and is it worth risking the relationship the US has with Israel, since they're vehemently opposed?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well I don't think that we can be certain that Iran will comply which is why we've set it up, so we can catch them if they cheat. But our central security priority here is to make sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. That would not just be dangerous for us, but it'd be dangerous for Israel and dangerous for the world. And almost every nuclear expert who's looked at this deal has been persuaded that in fact this is the best way for us to assure ourselves and the world that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon because we shut down a whole bunch of their facilities, they ship out in rich uranium that they already have and they do so for at least a 15 year period, they can't introduce advanced centre fusions that could produce weapons grade material and that doesn't mean that suddenly we have a good relationship with Iran. It does mean that we have taken off the table what poses a game changer, a great threat to us and we've done so without initiating a new military conflict in the Middle East. And that, I think, is something that should be embraced by all sides, as it is by practically every country in the world.","[INTERVIEWER1]. If Joe Biden, the vice president, decides to run for president, it'll be tricky to decide who to support I assume between him and Hilary Clinton, would you concede that it's easier for you if he doesn't run?","[INTERVIEWED]. What I would say is that both are Joe and Hillary are wonderful people, great friends. Joe's been as good a vice president as I think we've seen in American history and been at my side in every tough decision I've made. Hilary Clinton was one of our best secretaries of state and helped work on a whole range of really important issues, including the Iran deal with the outsetsetting up the sanctions that put pressure on Iran that forced them to the table. So, you know, the truth is though is the great thing about American democracy is it's not up to me, I'm just one voter. It's going to be up to the American people. My job over the next 14, 15 months is to stay focused on creating jobs, making sure the economic recovery that's been taking place continues, dealing with big challenges like climate change and making sure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Speaking of the economy, what would you say to hard working Philadelphians who lost their jobs in 2008, saw their 401Ks disintegrate for the most part, are just starting to feel like their recovering and this week here we go a similar problem, a major economic correction. Is this the exception or the rule, can you do something actively about it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well you know, as a rule I don't count it on the stock market going up and down, that's the nature of these markets. I think its more important to look at the long term trend lines that we've seen. I mean we've had more than five years now of private sector job growth every single month, over 13 million jobs created. And, you know, the American economy has actually proved to be more resilient, come back faster better, stronger than any of the advanced countries around the world, whether it's Europe, China, Japan. And I think that's a testimony to some good decisions that we've made, but in order to continue that progress, it's important that Congress doesn't stand in the way. And there are a couple things they are gonna need to do to continue economic progress. Number one, make sure that we pass a budget without shutting down the government, making sure that we don't have mindless cuts to critical areas like infrastructure and education, not screwing around with the debt limit like they did a couple years ago that caused all kinds of chaos and panic. As long as we stay focused on our fundamentals, doing what we know works, then the American economy will continue to grow will continue to improve. And then we've got to make sure that our workers, our people, our children are trained for those jobs in the future and that's why education, job training, things like that are so important and why we can't neglect those investments either.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We've had another violent incident this week that was deadly in Virginia. It's been a rough summer and a rough several years in the U.S. from rogue gunmen. What else will you be doing with gun control to stop this violence?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I've said in the past, it breaks my heart every time when you read about or hear about these kinds of incidents. Obviously the current investigation is still taking place. What we know is that the number of people who die from gun related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism. We're willing to spend trillions of dollars to prevent terrorist activities but we haven't been willing, so far at least, to impose some common sense gun safety measures that could save some lives. And right now Congress is bottlenecked in it but you're seeing state legislators and cities take action in some places and I hope that that grass roots movements to say that people can, you know, have guns for hunting and for protection but that we can also have some common sense rules like background checks. That those things will make a difference, my hope is that public pressure continues to grow.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithmouafacharbthemiddleeasttelevisionnetwork","text":["About Search"," "," ","[INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for supporting our channel and our initiative. We will make sure on our channel, your policy, the point of view of your administration, will always be presented clearly and in fair context. However, we will make sure—we want to be a model for the free press, the American tradition— other point of views, relevant ones, will always be there, even if they are critical of you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I understand that. I hope so. First of all, I appreciate your willingness to allow the people in the Middle East to hear my views. My views are one that speaks to freedom. I believe the Almighty God's gift to every person in the world is freedom, and I work for free societies because I believe in people.","I want people to know that I respect religion. I'm a religious man, myself. I respect the religion of other people as well. I believe we pray to the same Almighty God. I want people to know that I believe in peace. I want there to be peace. I also want people to know that it's very important for us to work together to fight terror, to fight those who would be willing to kill innocent lives in order to foster their own personal agendas.","I appreciate that. I also don't mind people expressing opinions other than mine. I expect that to happen. It happens here in America, and I expect it to happen around the world.","[INTERVIEWED]. You may be the only world leader today, and maybe the first American President, to pay a lot of attention to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. Why is that? Are you so committed to that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I am very committed to freedom and democracy in the Middle East. I believe people can self-govern around the world. Now, there are some, admittedly, say, \"Well, they can't have freedom and democracy in the Middle East.\" But I think that point of view is condescending. I think it diminishes the hopes and aspirations of the citizenry of the Middle East. I absolutely believe in freedom and peace, and I look forward to working with governments to achieve freedom and peace.","Now, I recognize not every government is going to fashion a free society in the vision of America. I don't expect that, but I do expect every government to uphold the aspirations of the average citizens in a free society.","[INTERVIEWED]. You mentioned in the State of the Union Address that you would be doubling the budget for the National Endowment of Democracy towards the Middle East. What's your vision? How are you trying to accomplish that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we need to work with governments and institutions and NGOs to encourage the institutions of a free society. See, one of the interesting things in the Oval Office—I love to bring people into the Oval Office, right around the corner from here, and say, \"This is where I office, but I want you to know the office is always bigger than the person.\" In other words, free societies are societies where people come and go, but the institutions that protect the rights of people never leave. And that's what the institute is going to be working on, free press, just like we just talked about, free elections, free society.","[INTERVIEWED]. You said you would be working with governments in the Middle East.","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWED]. And you know the type of governments that now exist in the Middle East, and for how long the U.S. has been accused of playing ball with governments that people hate. When you say you want this strategy, forward strategy of freedom, are you saying you're going to be abandoning the monarchies and, you know, those guys?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, of course not. I know them well. First of all, many of the countries in the Middle East are modernizing. And that's what I look for. I fully understand it takes time for free societies, truly free societies to evolve. I don't expect instant success. After all, in my own country it took a while for our current system to evolve.","Take Saudi Arabia, for example. First of all, I respect Crown Prince Abdullah and like Crown Prince Abdullah. He's a man of great faith and great integrity who gave a speech the other day about the need to modernize and to reform Saudi society. I take him for his word. To me that was a positive development.","King Abdullah of Jordan, the King of Morocco, I mean, there's a series of places—Qatar, Oman—I mean, places that are developing—Bahrain—they're all developing the habits of free societies. They evolve differently. But nevertheless, progress is being made. And for that, I'm very grateful.","[INTERVIEWED]. When you sit down with the leaders of the countries you just mentioned, [INTERVIEWED], do you get a sense of the urgency, when we talk about the issues of reform and democracy, from them?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I get a sense of two things from them. One, I do believe they understand the need to reform. But I also know they agree that we need to continue to work together to fight terror. And that's vital, because it's hard for a free society to develop with terrorists killing innocent people.","For example, I have a vision in the Middle East for there to be a Palestinian state. I'm the first [INTERVIEWED] to have ever articulated a Palestinian state. I believe there needs to be a Palestinian state, and I'm not going to change my opinion. On the other hand, I know how hard it is to achieve a Palestinian state so long as there's groups of terrorists willing to murder in order to prevent that from happening.","And so I hear two things. I hear, one, the need to reform, to include more people in the process which is taking place, but also the clear understanding from leaders that we must continue to work together to fight off the terrorists. And I say this with conviction. There's a—the murderous ambitions of a few are trying to derail the hopes of many. And my Government wants to work with governments to prevent that from happening.","[INTERVIEWED]. Has the roadmap failed? Do we need a new approach to revive the peace talks and work towards your vision?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, not at all, no. The roadmap is in place. What has failed is the—some parties are not advancing on the roadmap. They're stuck. And I stood up with Mr. Abu Mazen, at that time the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, with Prime Minister Sharon, in Aqaba, Jordan—and King Abdullah, of course, our host—and we linked arms and said, \"Let us move forward on the roadmap to peace.\" There needs to be a commitment to fight terror. There needs to be a commitment to put the institutions of a free society in place. There needs to be a commitment on the Israelis to worry about the plight of the average Palestinian citizen—to encourage a society to evolve that is commercially viable and free. There needs to be a commitment from the neighborhood to help fight off the flow of funds to fund the terrorist groups, that would stop.","And we were making progress. We really were, and then he got shoved aside. And so the roadmap is still intact. The vision for where we need to go is intact. What we need right now are parties who are willing to take a risk for peace and to lead. And I look forward to working with any such party.","[INTERVIEWED]. Why then are some people in the U.S. or some of your friends and allies in the Middle East say that you're not personally doing enough? How would you respond to that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would remind them of the pictures of Aqaba, Jordan. I mean, it's—it is a rare occurrence when [INTERVIEWED] stands up with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and says, \"We're linked together to move toward peace.\" The problem was, was that somebody undermined that peace process by making it very difficult for Prime Minister Abu Mazen to work to achieve his vision. And that somebody was Chairman Arafat. I'm sorry that happened. On the other hand, I still believe that a Palestinian state is essential for the aspirations of the Palestinian people. And I fully understand there needs to be a firm commitment to fight off terror in order for that to happen.","[INTERVIEWED]. On the issue of Iraq, how do you see the transition of sovereignty to the Iraqis?","[INTERVIEWED]. Moving. I mean, if you really take a step back, we're here in February of 2004, and the Iraqi people weren't really liberated until April of 2003. We haven't been there a year. And yet, there's tremendous progress being made. The first thing I pay attention to—there are voices speaking out about how to achieve democracy. Had those voices spoken out last year or the year before or the year before, they probably wouldn't be a voice anymore, given the fact that Saddam Hussein was willing to torture and kill dissidents.","And today, a free society is emerging. And it may look bumpy at times, but democracy sometimes looks bumpy. I mean, here in our own country I'm sure people take a step back and say, \"What is happening in the election process?\" I mean, it looks like there are some sharp elbows. But I am encouraged by what is taking place in Iraq. I appreciate so very much the fact that the Shi'as speak out for freedom. I appreciate the fact that the Sunnis are questioning whether or not they have a role in the future of their country. I appreciate the fact that the Kurds are active. I appreciate the fact that all three parties are trying to work for a common law that guarantees the religious rights of others, the minority rights of people in a free society.","So I think it's very positive. We look forward to working with the United Nations to help the process along, to add some international legitimacy to what the Iraqis think is necessary to move the process toward a new constitution and elections of people.","[INTERVIEWED]. From the outside, it looked like the Grand Ayatollah in Iraq, he's a religious man, he's calling for immediate elections, and we're kind of hesitant to do it right now. What's your reaction to that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that's very interesting. No, I understanding completely. First of all, I admire the fact that he is confident enough in democracy to call for elections. I mean, after all, America believes in elections. I think the only hesitancy from the experts is whether or not the process is ready to absorb direct elections. And we want to work with Mr. Sistani, the Ayatollah. He's a wise man. He's a distinguished gentleman who cares deeply about the Iraqi people. And I'm confident we can work toward a solution that is in Iraq's interest and, at the same time, addresses his deep desire to have the people of Iraq participate in the process.","I think the fact that he's willing to be involved is a very positive development. It shows people care about the future of Iraq. We just must all work together to come up with an Iraqi solution as to how best to get a constitution written and then direct elections. The first step, of course, is a general law and then a temporary assembly of some kind to help—so we can hand over sovereignty. And then the process moves forward.","[INTERVIEWED]. If we can move towards Syria.","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWED]. You had a couple of phone calls with the Syrian President after September 11, and things looked, you know, that [INTERVIEWED] of Syria was going in the right direction, according to your administration. And then things went sour. What happened?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think we made some legitimate requests. I said, \"Look, Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. They headquartered in your country. You need to shut down those headquarters. You need to prevent terrorist activities from being planned and/or orders being—emanating out of Syria. Secondly, you've got to work on the border to make sure that the border between Iraq and Syria is not porous, but, in fact, you are able to stop the flow of people and contraband and information back and forth. We don't want terrorists coming in from Syria into Iraq to kill innocent Iraqis and/or American troops.\" And it's very important for us to keep sending that message to him. That's why I appreciate doing this interview. The message still stands. And we would hope there would be a strong cooperation on these very reasonable points.","[INTERVIEWED]. The Syrian President sent a couple of signals recently expressing his willingness to resume peace talks with Israel. Would you be willing—how do you assess this——","[INTERVIEWED]. It's very interesting. First of all, I'm interested in peace. And the fact that a party is willing to talk about peace is, I think, a positive signal. I look forward to understanding fully what that means. As you know, there was—some progress had been made prior to my arrival as President on Syrian-Israeli peace talks. And we've just got to understand the intent, the sincerity, and the desire of both parties involved—that would be Syria and Israel.","[INTERVIEWED]. Libya.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. Although some people, maybe in Washington, and you may consider what happened with Libya as a success for diplomacy, but it did not sit well with the Libyans. It looks like it contradicts this forward strategy of freedom.","[INTERVIEWED]. How do you mean it didn't sit well with them? It sat well with Colonel Qadhafi because he made the decision.","[INTERVIEWED]. But in terms of democracy, I mean, you know, Qadhafi is a dictator——","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, whether or not democracy then follows—I see. Well, we hope it does, of course, and we look forward to working with him. But first things first. We had no relationship with Libya, and now the relationship can improve because he has made a very wise decision to disclose programs and dismantle those programs. To me, it's a signal that Colonel Qadhafi is interested in a peaceful—is interested in peace and a resumption of relations with a country like the United States, and that will begin to change the relationship.","Right now we want to make sure that we all fulfill our obligations. And a key obligation is for the United States and Great Britain and the IAEA to work with the Libyans to fully disclose and dismantle, in a transparent way, weapons programs.","[INTERVIEWED]. Would it be safe to say that the United States would not fully normalize with Libya unless the human rights record of the Libyan Government were to improve——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, there's a lot of conditionality in any relationship. We do want to improve relationships with Libya, but the first thing—the first step, of course, is for the Colonel to fulfill his commitment to the entire world, and that is to disclose and dismantle. And then the relationship will evolve.","[INTERVIEWED]. On the issue of weapons of mass destruction—Iran.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. Libya is a case where diplomacy worked. Iraq is a place where——","[INTERVIEWED]. Diplomacy didn't work.","[INTERVIEWED]. ——didn't work.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it didn't work. It was tried for 12 years, and it didn't work. And the world continually said, \"Disarm,\" and he didn't do it. And finally, I went to the United Nations and said to the United Nations, \"For your sake and for our sake—you, the United Nations' sake—for our sake, America, and for the world's sake, let us enforce these resolutions.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. So we've got the Libyan model, and we've got the Iraqi model.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. Which one would fit Iran today?","[INTERVIEWED]. All models must start with a strong effort by the world community to convince people to abandon—in this case, abandon programs, nuclear weapons programs. And we certainly hope the Iranian situation can be resolved diplomatically. I appreciate very much the fact that members of the European Community have spoken with one voice about the need for Iran * to fully disclose and disarm its weapons programs, and IAEA is very much involved.","So, in other words, we're now early in the stage, obviously, and it's a stage where I'm hopeful that diplomacy will work.","[INTERVIEWED]. You mentioned the international community. Are you satisfied with the way the international community is reacting towards the rebuilding of Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I really am. I mean, gosh, there's a lot of countries that are very much involved in Iraq. The other night in the State of the Union, I began to read off the list. And the longer the list got, the more the American people begin to realize this is a truly internationalized effort. And people are contributing money. I mean, I was talking about forces on the ground, and the level of contributions are very generous—starting with the United States, I might add. And I'm most proud of the Congress for being willing to help rebuild Iraq, because they understand, like I understand, that a free Iraq is going to be an agent of change in a positive way in the Middle East.","Again, I want to go back to where we began. See, if you didn't believe certain countries in the Middle East could be free, then you wouldn't be worried about rebuilding of a country. But I believe they can be free, and I know free societies are peaceful societies. And I believe in the Iraqi people of all walks of life, and I believe that they're going to show the world what is possible.","After all, the Iraqi people have such a— Iraqi history is so rich. The culture of Iraq is fantastic. And it's—I have visions of a university system that really leads the Middle East in education and on the forefront of science and engineering, because I know the Iraqi Americans who are here, very bright, capable, honorable people who have come to our country, realized the benefits of freedom, taken advantage of some fantastic opportunities, and made great citizens.","Well, the same thing is going to happen in Iraq. And that will cause others to say, \"Well, gosh, if it's happening in Iraq, let's follow that model of a free society.\" And the American Congress understands that. I understand that. And a lot of people around the world understand it. And I am grateful for the contributions that people are willing to make for the reconstruction of Iraq.","[INTERVIEWED]. Are you concerned that Iraq's neighbors may work to undermine the democracy because it doesn't suit the region?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's an interesting question. I certainly hope not. But if—look, one of the neighbors to Iraq is Turkey. And they withstood any pressure, if there was any pressure, to undermine the development of a free and secular society. They still maintain its respect for Islam.","Pakistan is another country which is evolving, showing what is possible in terms of a free society and an active Parliament and, at the same time, honoring Islam.","No, I think a truly free society will resist foreign efforts to undermine the development of that society.","[INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], this is an election year for you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. If, hypothetically, people in the Middle East could vote, would the next 4 years be—if you were to be elected— would be good for them?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, absolutely.","[INTERVIEWED]. Why would they vote for you?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. Well, they'd vote for me because I am strong on the war on terror, for starters. I refuse to relent to terrorist groups. There's no negotiation with these people. These are people that are willing to kill people who are devout, religious people, and not care about it. They kill innocent women and children and not care about it. More Muslims have died at the hands of killers than—I say more Muslims—a lot of Muslims have died—I don't know the exact count—at Istanbul. Look at these different places around the world where there's been tremendous death and destruction because killers kill.","They would appreciate George W. in the future because I understand that freedom and prosperity go hand in hand. And a free society is more likely to be a prosperous society where people can realize their hopes and aspirations.","Listen, I'm a dad. I love my girls more than anything in life, our daughters. I know that other dads feel the same way about their children, and all they want is for their children to have a chance to succeed, to grow up in a peaceful society, to be well-educated, and to realize their God-given potential. I share that dream.","I think the people of the Middle East will see that the Bush administration is unrelenting when it comes to dealing with the few who want to hurt the many but, at the same time, believes in the people of the Middle East, believes in their hopes and aspirations.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, sir."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersalarabiyanewschannel","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for your time.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's great to be with you. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You concluded the summit. Was it successful? Were there any sticking points that either you or your government did not achieve?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it was very successful. And the intentions here were to deepen and broaden what is already an excellent relationship between the GCC countries and the United States.","Obviously, we have a whole range of bilateral security arrangements with the various GCC countries. We've consulted and worked with them on a range of regional challenges. But I thought the time was ripe for us to be able to come together as a group, to talk face-to-face about a wide range of these issues, and then to put forward very specific plans in terms of how we can address them.","So the joint statement that we issued I think reflected the wide range of topics that were discussed. We discussed the important security assurances that I had delivered publicly in venues like the United Nations and had discussed privately, but I think it was important for them, at a time when there's so much chaos in the region, for the GCC members to hear that the United States is committed, if they are subject to external attack or the threat of attack, to work with the GCC to deter such attacks and to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the GCC countries.","We also talked about the joint work that we have to do to counter violent extremism in a whole range of areas, from ending the financing of terrorist organizations to improving intelligence, to what kinds of capabilities—for example, maritime security or cyber security—that are needed. And some of these areas are ones where it's better if we do them together in integrated fashion.","And we discussed Iran and why it is my firm belief that Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon and that the best way to achieve it is if we are able to accomplish a verifiable deal. But what I wanted to emphasize, because I think there's been concerns in the region about Iran's destabilizing activities, is that even if we get a deal on the nuclear issue we are still concerned with some of those activities by not only Iran and the Quds Force and the IRGC, but also proxies like Hezbollah.","And so I reaffirmed with them the interest in working to strengthen their defenses, strengthen our joint positions, and then hopefully we'll be in a position of strength in terms of expressing to the Iranians a desire for good relations, but also a insistence that they stop with some of those activities.","So, overall, I thought it was very successful. And the best part about it was there was a very frank and honest conversation, the kind that you can only have when you're face to face.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right. I'm going to pin you down on a few of the points that you just mentioned. When you said that you would use military power to protect your ally, what does that mean? I mean, what are you going to—","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, I think that we've seen in the past what happened in Kuwait when Saddam Hussein invaded. I think it is U.S. policy that in the Gulf, because of the wide range of interests and the deep friendship and security relations that we have with those countries, that if there was an external threat, our military would be working with the GCC, and hopefully a broad range of other international actors, to prevent that kind of violation of the basic norms of international behavior.","I think that there are concerns among some of the GCC members in how do we deal with not the traditional conventional threats, but asymmetric threats—terrorist activity, or the financing of violent activities in various countries' borders. And part of the point that I made to them is that those kinds of asymmetric threats are best dealt with through increasing capacity of training special forces, improving the interdiction of arms flowing in, better intelligence cooperation.","So some of the issues that we discussed had to do with very traditional military issues. And we'll be extending additional exercises, as I said, trying to help them evaluate where various GCC members are weaker and where they're stronger in their defense capabilities on, let's say, ballistic missile defense, for example. But some of these are less traditional issues that have to be addressed—how do we identify potential terrorist activity that may be taking place? How do we distinguish that from legitimate political activities that are taking place? I think those are issues that we'll continue to work on.","And the goal here is not that we've solved all these problems—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. — in one day-and-a-half summit, but rather that we created a framework, a set of intentions, and now we have a series of steps that we're going to have to take through our foreign ministers, our defense ministers, and they'll be reporting back to us","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. —so that when we meet again next year we will be able to see the progress that's been made.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right. But in this case, why can't you give them a written agreement to reinforce the Eisenhower understanding?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the statement is a written agreement. If you're asking why not provide a formal treaty, the truth of the matter is, is that the treaty process is very cumbersome, requires—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Congress approval.","[INTERVIEWED]. —congressional approval, and it's not necessary in this situation in order for us to be able to accomplish the goals that we wanted to meet.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I see. As you know, as you mentioned, it is a great concern about Iran's activities—in Lebanon, in Syria, in Yemen, and all of these Arab countries. And it's equal to kind of the worry from the nuclear threat for most Arab countries. Yet, the security arrangement that you have talked about does not address this. Does it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, actually it does, in the sense that when we talk about the need for us to have joint capabilities to address destabilizing activities and conflicts in the region, some of those are directly related to the concerns surrounding Iran. And that was—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Can you give me an example?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, a very good example is making sure that Iran is not pouring in arms to Houthis inside of Yemen. Obviously, there's a long history of political instability inside of Yemen. And the Houthis have their own indigenous history inside of Yemen. But if the IRGC is sending significant weapons into Yemen right on the Saudi border, that becomes then a source of concern.","And part of our goal here is to make sure that we are able to identify these problems, to highlight them, and then to deter them. And that was a major topic of discussion throughout the summit.","Keep in mind that the United States has been very clear that a nuclear-armed Iran would be potentially even more reckless and dangerous. And so it's in everyone's interest to ensure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon and that we provide a pathway for Iran to engage in positive behavior—in commerce, in trade, in education, in scientific exchange. That's the path that we hope they take.","But I've been very clear that just because we are able to resolve the nuclear issue does not negate the very real problems that we've had with their past state sponsorship of terrorism, with the potential for mischief in the region. And that's something that we will continue to address—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. —jointly with our GCC partners.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right. So will we see an increased military—U.S. military presence in the area of the Gulf, for example, on the Red Sea, around the Red Sea?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, the truth is that our military presence there is extremely robust. And we have thousands of ships—or thousands of troops. We have the Fifth Fleet. Our military assets in the region are very significant and ready to respond to a whole range of contingencies. And in addition, the GCC countries have significant capabilities, as well.","One of the things that we discussed was that the issue is not necessarily if we have enough military hardware, but are we using it properly? Are we coordinating it properly? Are we identifying the right tools for the specific challenges that we have today?","[INTERVIEWER1]. On the deal with Iran, some say it's a political gamble to have this deal because 10 to 15 years is a short period. And if they're going to use this money from the sanction relief to better the life of the Iranian people, it's kind of a wishful strategy. How do you respond to that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think it's a wishful strategy. The sanctions that we've imposed have been a brutal—","[INTERVIEWER1]. No, but I mean the money they're going to have—","[INTERVIEWED]. —imposition of costs on Iran. So when they receive money, they're going to have to do things just to shore up their economy, which has collapsed drastically during the course of my administration and the international sanctions that we've imposed.","So what is true is that we cannot simply trust the Iranians to abide by a deal. It has to be verifiable. And so part of what we did during this summit was to lay out the unprecedented steps to verify and inspect and monitor nuclear activity inside of Iran. And under the framework that we are now trying to memorialize, Iran would be subject to the kinds of inspections that have never been put in place before.","So we are confident that we can cut off the four pathways to Iran getting a nuclear weapon. And that verification process doesn't extend simply 10 years, or 15 years; it extends for a very, very long period of time.","The first phase—for 10 years—they would be severely restricted in their activities around any kind of nuclear power. In the subsequent decade, they would still be under the inspections regime that we are discussing, but they would be able to do more around peaceful nuclear power. And so they would have to, essentially, earn—re-earn the trust of the international community around these issues.","The alternative is to not have any idea what's taking place inside of Iran. And that, I think, is a much more dangerous situation for everyone in the region.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right. Let me just ask you this. Often you talk about Iran with admiration and you always praise the Iranian people. But somehow it's perceived in the region that you're putting down the Sunni Arabs, that somehow you link them to extremists. And I just want you to correct this, if this is the case, because that's the impression.","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that would be a mistaken impression so Al-Arabiya is going to have to do a better job delivering my message. Our closest friends in the region are the Gulf countries, and that relationship dates back for decades now.","And when I have spoken directly to the Iranian people, essentially what I've said to them is, you have the opportunity to restore traditions that would allow you to be a full-fledged and admired member of the international community. I want to encourage that. But I've been extraordinarily critical of the Iranian regime's ideology and the approach that they've taken to international affairs, as well as how they've dealt with their own people.","So what is true—and this was a topic of discussion—is that given the extraordinary history of the Gulf countries and the culture, and the fact that, for example, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the guardian of and the foundation stone for so much in the Muslim tradition and Muslim heritage—including, of course Mecca and Medina—that we do have to work together to make sure that youth in not just Gulf countries, but places like Iraq, Syria, Yemen—that they feel a sense of opportunity, and that we are not allowing them to be recruited into organizations like—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Daesh.","[INTERVIEWED]. —Daesh and previously al Qaeda that lead to a dead-end.","And that is as significant a danger as any that are faced by the GCC countries. If that continues, then that can end up being a cancer that eats away at the great nation states and traditions inside of the Gulf.","And I think we have to be honest about that, and I've had very straightforward conversations about that. This is something that all the GCC members agree—which is why part of our emphasis during this summit was not just weapons and strategies. It was also how do we encourage entrepreneurship—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. — through things like the Global Entrepreneurship Forum that we've initiated? How do we use social media so that we are reaching young people with a positive message that is as effective and as rapid as the use that ISIL is making of social media, that Daesh is making of social media?","So these are also part of the cooperation that we want to try to bring about over the coming year.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Talking of young leadership, you met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman here. What's your assessment of the young leadership of Saudi Arabia? And also you met the King himself.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. This is a new transition in the Kingdom.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, we have extraordinary respect for His Majesty and his leadership. I had a great relationship with King Abdullah, who is deeply missed. And Mohammed bin Nayef has been a partner with us on counterterrorism work and security work for a very long time.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. So we have great admiration for him.","This is the first time that we had had a chance to work closely with the Deputy Crown Prince, and I think he struck us as extremely knowledgeable, very smart, I think wise beyond his years.","And throughout the Gulf, what you're seeing I think is more young leadership moving into positions of authority and decision-making. And I think that's a positive thing.","When I came in, I was a relatively young man, as President.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Still are.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not as young now. I've got some gray hair. But the world moves so quickly now and is so sophisticated, and there's so much information that is having to be processed, that for us to be able to see that next generation move in, in an effective and decisive way I think will ultimately be very good for a region of the world that is young.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yeah.","[INTERVIEWED]. The truth is, is that the Gulf countries, and the Middle East and North Africa generally, those populations are all extraordinarily young. And we have to be able to speak and reach to those young people, and to adapt to the new circumstances of today's world.","[INTERVIEWER1]. My time is running out, but I want to ask you about Syria and Iraq, quickly. Many people believe that Syria is your Rwanda. It might haunt you for years to come—200,000 dead; 9 million people displaced; the worse humanitarian crisis in the 21st century. Are we going to see the end of all bloodshed before you leave office, [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll be honest, probably not. Because the situation in Syria is heartbreaking, but it's extremely complex. And I am haunted by the hardships and the deaths. It's something I take very seriously. But when the analogy is used of Rwanda it presumes that some sort of swift U.S. intervention would have prevented these problems.","You have a civil war in a country that arises out of long-standing grievances. It wasn't something that was triggered by the United States; it wasn't something that could have been stopped by the United States. And one of the things that I've said in this summit—and I was very blunt—is that all too often, I think in the Middle East region, people attribute everything to the United States.","[INTERVIEWER1]. True.","[INTERVIEWED]. There are conspiracy theories everywhere.","[INTERVIEWER1]. True.","[INTERVIEWED]. If something wrong happens, well, it must be the United States. If something --","[INTERVIEWER1]. They look to the U.S. for leadership.","[INTERVIEWED]. —if something—if we did something, then why didn't the United States meddle in our affairs. If we don't do something, then, well, why isn't the United States doing something. I think that's a common theme. And I was very frank with the GCC leaders. I said, look, we're partners; we can do these things together. But the United States ultimately can only work through Arab countries who are also working on their own behalf to deal with these issues.","And part of our goal here is to build capacity. This is why in Iraq, for example, I have been fully prepared to support a legitimate, constitutionally appropriate Iraqi government. But what I've said is we will work through the Iraqi government and the Iraqi military and we will support them.","And in Syria, our efforts have to be as part of a broader international coalition, and ultimately a military solution is not going to be the solution. If the United States simply sent in troops into Syria—our military is very effective, and for a short period of time, we potentially could come down on the side of the opposition against Assad. But in terms of governance, in terms of keeping the peace, in terms of working through some of the sectarian issues that have plagued that country as well as the region for such a long time, those would still be there.","And so we're prepared to work not just with the GCC, but with countries like Turkey—which has a very powerful military, are right on the border. They've got 2 million people who they have very generously, I think, accepted from Syria. But ultimately, it makes more sense for us to work with them, rather than unilaterally—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sure","[INTERVIEWED]. —in order to resolve what is a very serious humanitarian issue.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sure but, forgive me, [INTERVIEWED], when people rise and they demand their rights, they look up to the United States.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. They don't look to any other country. And especially after President Assad used chemical weapons, people felt they've been let down. The civil war did not start from day one. They felt that you could have done something in the beginning and you didn't.","[INTERVIEWED]. But if you look at the history of the process, essentially what they're arguing is that we should have invaded Syria and overthrown the Syrian regime—which, by the way, would be a violation of international law, and undoubtedly we would then be criticized for that, as well.","And so what I think we have tried to do is be very clear about principles, what we believe in. With respect to the chemical weapons issue, my principle was that chemical weapons should not be used. People may criticize us for not having launched missiles against Assad after chemical weapons had been used, but keep in mind why we didn't. We didn't because they got rid of their chemical weapons.","And that, in fact, was very important. It didn't solve barrel bombs. It didn't solve the incredible hardships that all the Syrian people are going through. But to solve those larger problems, that requires the kind of international work in which we are obviously a very significant part and a very significant partner—and my Secretary of State, John Kerry, has been tireless in trying to arrive at a diplomatic solution to this problem.","Part of the problem we also have is that on the other side inside of Syria, we have extremists who may be opposed to Assad but also deeply opposed to the United States, are deeply opposed to the GCC countries; are interested in establishing a very destructive order and have engaged in the same kinds of brutality and violence that we don't want to see deeply entrenched.","So these are difficult times. These are difficult challenges. What I'm optimistic about is that the GCC countries represent stability and also I think an awareness of the need for us to be able to move together and create the framework so that young people—instead of being attracted to violence, or not being able to go to school, or being victims in the crossfire of civil war—are able to live peacefully. And I think they also understand the need for us to move beyond the sectarianism that is being fanned by extremists who just want power and use that as an excuse.","[INTERVIEWER1]. One last question. I was told it's over. You're the second President I'm interviewing who is leaving office without realizing the vision of a Palestinian state. You had serious efforts in the first and second administration. Yet we receive—we reached a dead-end. Why? Who is responsible for that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, this is a very difficult challenge. On the one hand, I am a deep and strong supporter of Israel, and the connection between the United States and Israel is obviously powerful. And Israel has legitimate security concerns. There's no doubt about it. And what is also true is I'm deeply committed to a Palestinian state.","You know, in my visits to places like Ramallah, when I talk to young Palestinian students and I hear their sense that their world is shut off because of their circumstances in the West Bank, or when I hear some of the heartbreaking stories in Gaza, the only solution to me over the long term is a two-state solution.","And we worked very hard, but, frankly, the politics inside of Israel and the politics among the Palestinians, as well, made it very difficult for each side to trust each other enough to make that leap.","And what I think at this point, realistically, we can do is to try to rebuild trust—not through a big overarching deal, which I don't think is probably possible in the next year, given the makeup of the Netanyahu government, given the challenges I think that exist for President Abbas—but if we can start building some trust around, for example, relieving the humanitarian suffering inside of Gaza and helping the ordinary people in Gaza to recover from the devastation that happened last year; if we can do more to create business opportunities and jobs inside the territories—if we can slowly rebuild that kind of trust, then I continue to believe that the logic of a two-state solution will reassert itself.","Because I've said to the Israelis you cannot remain a state that is both a democracy and Jewish if you continue to have this problem unresolved. And with respect to the Palestinians, I've said that you cannot expect to have a state of your own and the full dignity and respect that is inherent for all human beings if you also don't recognize Israel, because Israel is not going anywhere.","And I think that people of goodwill on both sides understand that. Unfortunately, the politics of fear has been stronger than the politics of hope over recent years—partly because of the chaotic situation in the region overall. And it's going to take some time to rebuild it. But as I said yesterday at Camp David, nobody would have imagined that Israel and Egypt would remain at peace for decades—","[INTERVIEWER1]. Right.","[INTERVIEWED]. — until finally leadership seized the day. And the United States wants to be a strong partner in this. We can't do it for the Palestinians or the Israelis. But we can continue to push for what we believe is the truth and what we believe is right.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So no meeting between Netanyahu and Abbas?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you never say never. So we'll see how it unfolds. But the U.S.'s commitment to both a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestinian state, that remains our policy.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I have other questions about Yemen and Iraq, but time is running out. So thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I really appreciate it.","[INTERVIEWED]. I appreciate it. Thank you."]}

Welcome, welcome.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]. We are glad you're here.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWED]. Come on in to the Oval Office.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We are grateful for this. Thank you. This is great.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's an interesting history here, and I kind of think one thing that your viewers might be interested in knowing is that the first decision I ever made as President—but I was actually Presidentelect—was, what color rug do you want? And one of the important things is to surround yourself with people who you can trust and delegate. In this case, I delegated the rug design to Laura, my wife.","But I told her, I said, I want the rug to have a message, and that is \"optimistic guy goes to work here.\" And so, as you can see, the rug really lights up the room. And I am optimistic about the future of the Middle East.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Well, that's a great note, sir. You've been here 8 years. A few weeks and you're going to be leaving.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm going home.","[INTERVIEWER1]. You sat on this desk for 8 years, and you took many decisions regarding our region. You launched the greater Middle East initiative that you want to democratize, reform the Middle East. In retrospect, do you think that vision was realized? Would you do anything differently?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it began— it's the beginning of a very difficult vision to implement. But I felt it was necessary for a couple of important reasons. One, I believe we're in an ideological struggle against people who want to achieve their ideological vision through the use of violence and murder. And I believe it is essential that you have an alternative available for people; the one I happen to believe in is based upon liberty. I don't think this is an American vision, see. And I tell people this, that I do believe there is a universal God, and a gift of that Almighty to all of us, whether we be Methodists or Muslims or nothing, is freedom. And so freedom is a great alternative.","But I also believe there's a moral calling. If you believe there's an Almighty God, and a gift of that Almighty to everybody is freedom, then I think you have to—if you can do something about it, that you have to act on that, so that moms can grow up in a society that is hopeful for their children, you know, that their children are—can realize dreams.","And to me the best type of society to do that is freedom. But it's very hard; it's difficult. And so you have to plant a seed, and you have to cultivate the seed, and eventually the crops will bloom. And we're beginning to see the crops beginning to bloom in parts of the Middle East.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sir, some people say that the war on terror is a war on Islam.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Yet you went to the first mosque after 9/11, and you spoke there. How do you convince people in the Middle East that George Bush is not fighting a war against Islam?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I know, and it troubles my soul, because I believe we're all God's children. And I hear people say, \"George Bush doesn't like Muslims, he wants to fight Muslims.\" And first, I thank you for giving me the chance to, hopefully, set the record straight. But I am objecting to anybody who murders innocent people to achieve their objectives. I don't think people who murder in the name of religion are truly religious people. And secondly, I would hope that people would know that when we try to use some of our influence to help on education programs, for example, or we welcome students, Saudi students, to the United States to study here, that it's a sign of respect and a sign of my desire to reach out to all people regardless of their religion.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Absolutely. wanted also to ask you about, in the last 8 years, if you look back, would you do things differently? Would you have done things that you probably thought for a second—for the second time, I would have done them a different way?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm sure there will be. I mean, there's been some disappointments.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Like what?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, like, Abu Ghraib was a terrible disappointment. And admittedly, I wasn't there on the site, but I was the Commander in Chief of a military where these disgraceful acts took place that sent the absolute wrong image about America and our military.","You know, parts of Iraq, it's taken longer than I thought it would. On the other hand, I am pleased to see a multiethnic society begin to emerge. I talked to the leaders of Iraq yesterday and today and congratulated them on doing some hard work. And I love to hear their spirit in their voice.","And so I'm confident history will say, \"Oh, Bush could have done it better here,\" or, \"Bush could have done it better there.\" But I think from the strategic point of view, I'm confident that the idea of moving liberty in the region, a two-state solution to help the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the liberation of Iraq, and the follow-up with the— to help the Iraqis realize their sovereignty—a strong push-back against Iran— I believe when people objectively analyze this administration, they'll say, \"Well, I see now what he was trying to do.\"","[INTERVIEWER1]. I mean, the Arab peace initiative, it was a framework. Do you think that President-elect Obama should use it in terms of achieving peace in the Middle East?","[INTERVIEWED]. I definitely think it was a major breakthrough for then Crown Prince, now His Majesty, King Abdallah, to take the initiative and lay out the conditions for peace. And it is, I think, a useful foundation to help solve a longstanding problem. I do believe there will be a Palestinian state. I feel comfortable in saying that the decision—my decision to promote a Palestinian state, being the first President to do so, was the right thing for peace— right thing for peace for the Palestinians, right thing for peace for the Israelis. And His Majesty was very useful and very bold in laying out the Arab peace initiative.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We're going to talk about all this in details so——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, come on, I'll show you the Rose Garden.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——let's walk and talk as we go down to the Map Room.","[INTERVIEWED]. You've seen the Rose Garden before.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I have, many times.","[INTERVIEWED]. Many times. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. It's beautiful.","[INTERVIEWED]. It is a beautiful day.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What are you going to miss most about this place?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, I'll miss a lot. I am—I've got such respect for our military, and I admire people in our military so very much. I'll miss being the Commander in Chief. But you know, the White House is full of incredibly gracious and kind people who work hard to make family life as normal as possible. And so I'll miss a lot of the people we work with here.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And what's your plans?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm going to move back to Texas.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And what are you going to do there?","[INTERVIEWED]. And I'm going to, you know, write a book, I think, about what it was like to be President and some of the hard decisions I had to make. I'm going to start a institute that will promote freedom. And this will be an interesting place, particularly in regards to the Middle East, because this will be a place where there will be a forum for people with different issues to come and discuss.","You know, I would love to have, you know, Palestinians, such as the President or the Prime Minister, to come and describe to the Americans what it was like to be in that part of the world. Or you know, there's just a lot of really interesting opportunities for people to come and lecture and think and talk.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And in your book, obviously, we're talking about foreign policy. Most of it happened in the Middle East—okay, we're off camera now. I hope the guy is okay.","[INTERVIEWED]. A lot of—yes. He fell into the Rose Garden.","[INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for this exclusive interview with us——","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——and thank you very much for granting us, to MEBC, and to me, personally, on behalf of Arab media. I really do appreciate it; I'm very grateful.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. I've enjoyed working with you. You've been a very fair journalist, and it's been a pleasure to have known you.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. You are the first American President to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. You had hoped that you would have this state realized when you leave office. Do you think that you could have done more? Do you think that you have thrown all of the weight of the U.S. behind this vision?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. We threw all the muscle and all the weight of the United States behind the vision. I am—you know, I wish there would have been a clearly defined state by the time I left office. However, I do take comfort in a couple of things.","One, the attitude toward a Palestinian state has shifted. I think there's universal recognition in the region that in order for there to be peace, there must be two states living side by side in peace. Secondly, I am pleased that Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, after Annapolis, have worked very hard to narrow the differences on a variety of issues. And they have; they've made substantial progress.","Thirdly, I am pleased that there is the Arab peace plan, which is an essential part of creating the conditions for a Palestinian state to evolve. Fourthly, I'm grateful that at the Annapolis conference all Arab nations were represented, which is an important signal, because I learned a lesson in studying previous efforts for peace that there must be regional buy-in. In other words, the nations in the region must stand with the Palestinians, in particular, and say this is—we support you.","And so—and fifthly, by the way, I am pleased with the progress being made to help the development of an infrastructure in the West Bank. Prime Minister Fayyad has asked for help. A lot of nations are helping, including the United States; we're helping with security measures. Generals Dayton and Jones have been very helpful. My friend Prime Minister Blair—former Prime Minister Blair, who was here the other night for dinner—and I talked about the economics that are beginning to take place in the region. In other words, a state can be defined on paper, but it also has to be defined in a civil society and a strong economy. And it's beginning to happen.","[INTERVIEWER1]. How do you see the Palestinian issue evolving in the next few years? I mean, Prime Minister Tony Blair said, actually, there's no peace without Gaza, and I guess that means Hamas as well. Do you share that vision?","[INTERVIEWED]. I share the vision that the only way there's going to be peace is where those who assume that violence is necessary to achieve peace cannot be a part of the process. In other words, people have to renounce violence in order to have peace. It's contradictory to say, I am going to use violence to achieve my objectives, and oh, by the way, I'm for peace.","And so ultimately, Gaza has got to be— look, Gaza has to be a part of a Palestinian state, and the Palestinian state has to be contiguous territory; it cannot look like Swiss cheese. And it's got to be a state in which the sovereignty of the Palestinian people is—reigns supreme.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So you're confident it's going to emerge?","[INTERVIEWED]. I am. I really am. There will be fits and starts. I mean, if this were a straight line between vision and reality, it would have happened. But there's a lot of complicating factors. Obviously, the terrorists create complicating factors. Secondly, politics creates complicating factors, both within the Palestinians, as well as the Israelis, as we have seen.","But nevertheless, the foundation is there. People—if you give people a choice, ultimately give them a choice between two states side by side in peace or this unresolved dispute, what would they choose? They would choose peace. And this will happen.","[INTERVIEWER1]. What will [INTERVIEWED] pick up from where you left?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we've left it in good shape. We've left it with the vision intact. In other words, a lot of people now share the vision of two states. As I say, there's been progress between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian President toward what a state should look like. I think the Israelis are getting—be more comfortable with the notion that a state won't create less security for them, but more security for them. And the Arab world, because of the Arab initiative as well as the Annapolis conference, are showing more and more willingness to be constructive partners in getting peace.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The U.S. and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have a close strategic relationship. You personally have a very good working relationship with King Abdallah. Yet you don't see eye to eye on many issues. How did you resolve that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we do. I think we got—I think we agree more than we disagree. First of all, I hold His Majesty in high respect. I appreciate, for example, the religious dialogue that he instigated, and I was honored to be invited to go to New York. I thought that was a very smart way to help promote understanding, and understanding eventually leads to peace.","He is a man who understands that terrorists can destroy his own society. And so I—I don't know if the world understands this or not, but Saudi Arabia has been very firm in dealing with Al Qaida. And remember, it was Al Qaida that tried to blow up their oil infrastructure; they killed their citizens. And His Majesty knows full well that that kind of terrorism cannot coexist with a peaceful society. When I have my discussions with him, I find there's a lot more common ground than not.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So there's no disagreement with the Palestinian issue with what——","[INTERVIEWED]. I think His Majesty—look, the Arab peace initiative actually talks about, you know, Israel solving its problems with Lebanon and Syria and the Palestinians, and there will be universal recognition when that happens. And so to me that is a very positive statement. And that the idea of a Palestinian state as part—as far as being part of the solution to the overall problem is something I believe he agrees with. I don't want to put words in his mouth, because he's my dear friend.","[INTERVIEWER1]. In the recent years, there was an emergence of Qatar as a regional player in many of the countries in the Middle East. Do you see that played on the—kind of at the expense of traditional allies of the U.S., like Saudi Arabia and Egypt?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it's going to be very important for the initiatives instigated by Qatar to show results, for example, with Hamas. Now, Hamas—in my judgment, the violent wing of Hamas damages the prospects for a Palestinian state. Or with Hizballah—I believe that Hizballah is a very destabilizing influence, particularly when they resort to violence.","So what I would look for, and do look for, and would hope the next President would look for is, okay, are these initiatives bearing fruit? We, of course, appreciate, you know, our basing agreement with Qatar, and we thank them very much for that. And we would hope that they would follow through to deliver the results for peace, which is what we all want, I hope.","[INTERVIEWER1]. We're going to move to Iraq. Recently, the U.S. and the Iraqi Government have signed the status of forces agreement. What do you think of it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that the strategic framework agreement and the status of forces agreement is a sign that the Iraqi democracy is emerging and is healthy. There was a lot of debate on the SFA and SOFA, and there were people that were—you know, a lot of people were saying, well, this will be bad for Iraq, and others say this will be good for Iraq. And after the debate was over, it was ratified by the people's assembly, and I think that's a healthy sign. I also think it's very good to have an agreement in place that recognizes the sovereignty of Iraq and recognizes that the United States will be moving its forces out of cities and then eventually out of the country based upon success.","[INTERVIEWER1]. In retrospect, would you think that this war could be averted?","[INTERVIEWED]. We tried to avert it. I know people say, \"Oh, George Bush likes to use the military.\" That's the hardest thing for a President to do, is to put soldiers in harm's way, because I knew what would happen. And you know, that's of course manifested when I meet with mothers of fallen soldiers or wives or husbands. And it is incredibly sad, as I'm sure you can imagine, very emotional, to hug and to cry with families. And I've met with a lot of families—a lot—so I knew the consequences. I really did.","And I was hoping that through diplomatic pressure that we would be able to resolve this issue peacefully. And I remember—you can't take this Iraq out of the post-9/11 context. We'd been attacked, and here's a man who I have said repeatedly, you know, was not directly involved in 9/11, but had used weapons of mass destruction and had supported terror and had paid the families of suicide bombers and was a sworn enemy of the United States and had invaded two countries and had ignored, you know, 17 or however many resolutions in the United Nations. He was a threat.","But I did go to the United Nations, as you remember. Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences, is what 1441 said. And I firmly believe the choice was Sad-dam Hussein's to make, and he made a fateful choice. Then the interesting point was, after he was removed, with a broad coalition of countries, what do we do? You know, do we pick a strong man and say, here's America's guy and put him in there? Or do we work so that the Iraqi citizens would be able to pick their own form of government and their own people? And that's what we chose to do, and it's been really hard.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Was it worth it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely. I believe a Middle East with Saddam Hussein in power today would be different, much different than the one today. I think you'd see a man with a lot of oil wealth willing to use terrorist connections to try to compete, for example, with Hizballah.","There could conceivably be a nuclear arms race taking place, while even though Saddam Hussein did not have nuclear weapons, it is certain, at least to the experts, that he still had the capacity to make nuclear weapons. And there would be nothing more destabilizing for the Middle East than to see Iran trying to develop a nuclear weapon and Iraq trying to develop a nuclear weapon.","So I think the Middle East is a much better place without Saddam Hussein in power, and the sacrifices by both the Iraqi people and the coalition forces to achieve where we are today.[INTERVIEWER1]. But some say, sir, that the removal of Saddam Hussein has bolstered Iran and make emergent as a regional superpower.","[INTERVIEWED]. I disagree completely with that. I think the emergence of a democratic and stable Iraq on Iran's border is in the— will help more likely keep the peace vis-a-vis Iran in the Middle East.","Secondly, what has changed with Iran is universal recognition about the dangers of Iran having a—the capacity to make a nuclear weapon. And therefore, one of the objectives of my administration is to create an international coalition all saying the same thing, which is, you have defied the IAEA, therefore, you cannot be trusted to say that you're only enriching for civilian nuclear power; therefore, stop your process, verify they stopped their enrichment process; otherwise, there will continue to be international sanctions.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The Iranian—recently your administration has been involved diplomatically with the Iranians. Do you think that actually you can bring them to the international fold by engaging them diplomatically?","[INTERVIEWED]. We're trying to—we've offered them a way forward; it's verifiably suspend your enrichment. And we will be at the table with other nations.","And so, well, we discussed Iraq with Iran in a regional context. But we have said there is—if you want to have diplomatic relations and discussions with the United States, verifiably suspend your enrichment program. Our objective is to stop their gain of knowledge that would enable them to build a nuclear weapon, because having a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing to the region.","And so there is a way forward for them to have diplomacy. But it's their choice, and thus far, they have not chosen to do it. And I regret that our relations are with Iran—are this way, because I have great respect for the Iranian people and the Iranian history. And I know that they can have a better future with the rest of the world, if their leadership were to abandon its desire to learn how to build a nuclear weapon.","[INTERVIEWER1]. I have a few questions about just Syria and Lebanon, but my time is over.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for your—you're a beautiful interviewer.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you, sir. So can I go ahead?","[INTERVIEWED]. Quickly. And then I really do have to go.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Sure, absolutely. I wanted to talk about Syria. Basically, the U.S. attacked Syria. But do you see——","[INTERVIEWED]. The U.S.——","[INTERVIEWER1]. ——attacked Syria recently. There was a target inside Syria that was attacked by——","[INTERVIEWED]. Allegedly, yes.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Allegedly. But do you see this kind of tension will succeed soon, or do you see the U.S. diplomatically engaged in Syria?","[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, we discussed no operations. Secondly, we have engaged Syria early in my administration with Secretary Colin Powell and others. And our message was, if you'd like to have better relations with us, stop housing Hamas, violent Hamas, stop destabilizing the democracy of Lebanon, stop facilitating the flow of terrorists into Iraq, be a constructive neighbor to countries, and we can have better relations. And they have, thus far, chosen to do that. Again, there is a way forward.","But my worry about just sitting down with people and hoping that they end up behaving differently is that oftentimes it reinforces behavior that is not in our interests. And so I believe in conditional diplomacy. Now, there is a lot of multilateral diplomacy going on out of this administration. But in this case, just like Iran, we will have diplomatic relations if you choose, but there's got to be behavioral change in order to justify it.","[INTERVIEWER1]. And can you stabilize Lebanon?","[INTERVIEWED]. I've been trying to—one of the great successes has been to get 30,000 or so Syrian troops out of Lebanon. I think one of the real keys to peace in the Middle East is Lebanon. And Lebanon is a democracy. I've met their President recently here in the Oval Office, which— had a very a good discussion. I've been very impressed by Prime Minister Siniora's courage and boldness. We want to help Lebanon have an armed forces that are effective, so that they can protect their people. And we have been working very hard for 7 years to free Lebanon as much as possible from foreign interference, so that its democracy can grow and mature and be a stable contributor to the region.","President's Legacy in the Middle East","[INTERVIEWER1]. How would you like the people in the Middle East to remember you?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would hope they would remember me as George W. Bush, as a man who respects their religion, respects human rights and human dignity, and prays for peace.","[INTERVIEWER1]. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnatasabriskisloveniaspoptv","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. First of all, I would like to thank you very much for this opportunity and for your time, [INTERVIEWED]. . Thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWED]. You're welcome.","[INTERVIEWED]. 's Visit to Slovenia","[INTERVIEWER]. Your first 7 years ago and what just might be your very last trip to Europe as [INTERVIEWED]. include both includes both times a stop in Slovenia. Excellent choice, I might add.","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't blame you for saying it. First of all, my first trip was consequential because that's where I first met Vladimir Putin. This trip is consequential because, of course, we're going to have an EU-U.S. summit. And my impressions of Slovenia I've told this to a lot of people is first of all, it's a beautiful country.","[INTERVIEWER]. It is.","[INTERVIEWED]. Probably somewhat undiscovered in America, but my fellow citizens ought to go and explore Slovenia cause it's, I think, not only it's got I mean, you can ski, you can play golf.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's a lot of opportunities for mountain biking.","[INTERVIEWED]. You can fish, mountain biking. So it's beautiful. And plus, the people are incredibly friendly.","EU-U.S. Summit","[INTERVIEWER]. You are coming for the U.S.EU summit.","[INTERVIEWED]. Right.","[INTERVIEWER]. To no dramatic announcements expected. But it will be the last summit for you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. What outcome would you like to see?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, look, the important thing about these summits is that it reaffirms our mutual values of human rights and human liberty, of our desire to work together on some key issues. And the United States and Europe has had its differences on certain issues, and but we've always had the same common values. And it's important for me to signal to the Europeans, as well as my fellow citizens, that this relationship is an important relationship. And I'm confident the next [INTERVIEWED]. will see it as an important relationship as well. But we'll discuss a lot of important issues there too.","[INTERVIEWER]. You're also coming to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Marshall plan and Berlin Airlift, the historic role U.S. had after World War II in supporting Europe. And you know, Europe has changed a lot recently: Western Balkans, two new states; Kosovo high on a priority list for Slovenia's Presidency. I would like to hear, what do you think are the most memorable events, Europe-wise, that your administration helped to achieve in the past 7 years?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, one, of course, is the expansion of NATO. And it's a I'll never forget going to Romania right after nations some nations were admitted into NATO and talking about Article 5 an attack on one is an attack on all. And a lot of countries had come from a different style of government and a different type of security arrangements to one in which free nations were bound together. And so the expansion of NATO and the offering of sending a positive signal to Georgia and Ukraine recently has been an incredibly positive accomplishment. I think working together in Afghanistan is a is going to be an historic achievement; helping a young democracy recover from a society in which women, for example, were treated as unbelievably second-class citizens. I mean, it was just a barbaric regime. Hopefully, in terms of trade, that we'll fight off protectionism and keep trade open. I know there's some trade disputes going on, but that shouldn't prevent us from being active in terms of perpetuating free and fair trade. And so one of the things, of course, we'll be discussing is the Doha round of the WTO.","[INTERVIEWER]. That's true. And it probably Iran might be also high on the agenda at the summit?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, Iran kind of the common threats will be on the agenda. For me as you know, I'm a big believer in freedom. Interesting that Europe is now whole, free, and at peace, and there's a reason why. And we got to, in my judgment, extend that same concept to the Middle East, from which a lot of violence comes. And obviously, one of the problems that we face is preventing Iran from developing the know-how as to how to make a nuclear weapon.","And so we'll be discussing that kind of joint efforts, multilateral efforts. But you know, I also want to emphasize that but the United States and I personally feel very strongly about helping people realize the blessings of life by freeing them from HIV/AIDS or malaria or hunger. And I'm very proud of our Nation's accomplishments in terms of those agenda items. And I'm looking forward to working with our European colleagues to see if we can't make it even more robust.","Visa Waiver Program","[INTERVIEWER]. Next question would be on visa waiver.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's an issue, I know. It's an issue in Europe.","[INTERVIEWED]. It is an issue. It is an issue.","[INTERVIEWER]. And you know that currently, United States enforces two different systems for travelers from","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. European countries. Plus, you just announced new, stricter rules for countries that are part of the Visa Waiver Program. I wanted to hear your opinion on that, and maybe your answer to those in Europe who say that America is not as welcoming a place that it used to be.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. No, look, I'm concerned about that impression, because we are a welcoming place. We want our friends to come. We want investment to be open.","You know, first of all, I can understand why many of our friends in Europe who aren't treated like other nations within the EU are treated on visas are concerned. They say: \"Wait a minute. We're very supportive of the United States. We like the United States. And yet we're treated differently when it comes to visas.\" And this is a hangover from the old visa system, which I have been assiduously working to change. And we are making good progress. As a matter of fact, there I think there's going to be quite a few nations that were will get visa waiver.","As to whether or not we've made it harder for visa waiver countries to come to the United States, actually not; we've made it easier. In other words, you file your paperwork online before you come to the United States, which should actually facilitate travel, we hope. But look, I am concerned that people say, \"Well, America no longer wants us to come,\" when it's the exact opposite of my personal point of view and the view of my government.","[INTERVIEWER]. Sure. And I have to ask you this: Public surveys taken globally indicate kind of anti-Americanism, and","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Europe is no exception in that. Do you believe that the American brand needs a makeover?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. I mean, we stand for liberty and human rights and freedom. Look, I've had to make some tough decisions that some people didn't like. But the truth of the matter is, when you really look at like, for example, our relations in the Far East, we got great relations with Japan, China, and Korea South Korea. Or India, for example we got new relations with India that no administration has ever pushed South America, and Central America. My attitude is this this is what I tell people: First of all, you can't make decisions based upon opinion polls. Secondly, that a lot of people like America; they may not sometimes necessarily like the [INTERVIEWED]. , but they like America. They like what America stands for. Otherwise, why would so many people wanting to be come here, for example, which we welcome. And so I don't I hear just stuff like that, and I just I dismiss it as kind of like what happens when there's, kind of, gossip and rumors and because the truth of the matter is, America, just like many nations in Europe, stands for what's right, which is decency and freedom of speech and freedom to worship. And I'm very proud of my country, obviously.","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay. And on American Presidency, actually on elections, international policies are the aspects where the [INTERVIEWED]'s work that where the Commander in Chief has an opportunity to change the history's course.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. And that is why people around the world follow the American elections very, very closely. It's been very interesting so far.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it has.","[INTERVIEWER]. The Democrats Democratic candidates have not been very easy on you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course not. They got me look, if you're that's what happens. I mean, they say, \"We want change.\" Of course and I tell people, every time I ran for politics I said, \"We want change,\" unless, of course, I was the incumbent, in which case I was not for change; I was for myself. But what you'll see is a lot of rhetoric, and I understand that. It's and, you know, I'm in an unusual position because for the past 14 years, I've been an active candidate myself, and now I'm kind of getting to be a senior kind of senior status. And I'll help my party, and of course, I'm for John McCain. But there will be a lot of debate, and it will be interesting to watch these candidates.","[INTERVIEWER]. Sure. So your message to the 44th [INTERVIEWED] of the United States would be?","[INTERVIEWED]. Stand on principle, stay strong, promote freedom, defend America, and work with our friends and allies to achieve common objectives.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for this interview. I hope you will have a safe flight to Europe. And as you referred to Slovenia 2 years ago, on our Prime Minister's visit to the White House, as an \"interesting slice of heaven,\" I hope you will have a heavenly stay.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll bet I do.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you so much. Good to see you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnedtemkotheobserverromeitaly","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. You're giving a major speech in Paris in a few hours' time on what you describe as a new era of transatlantic union. And obviously, the picture in Europe is much more encouraging, it would seem, than a few years ago. What's changed, in your view, and what needs to be fixed?","[INTERVIEWED]. This is the what's changed is the we've gone beyond the Iraq period for two reasons. One is that Iraq is democracy is succeeding. People are beginning to see progress. And therefore, people that at least governments that felt like they didn't want to participate in the liberation of Iraq have now wanted to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq. And their people are beginning to see some success. Maliki has moved things Stockholm and comports himself like a leader would, and he speaks hopefully about the future.","Secondly, that there are a lot of issues that we're focused on that kind of send a signal that cooperation is necessary to change the conditions of the world for the better cooperation on AIDS, cooperation on malaria, cooperation on trade, hopefully, discussion about climate change, cooperation in Afghanistan. In other words, the agenda is varied, and it's profound.","And my speech basically says that by focusing on these issues and by working together in a unified way, we can be trans-formative, just like we were in the past. Europe used to be inward looking right after World War II necessarily so to rebuild. America helped. Now we can be outward looking as we help others.","I also have a I'm a believer that liberty is transformative the power of liberty is universal, that moral relativism must be rejected, and that we've got to have confidence in liberty to help others so that we're more secure ourselves. And that's what the speech is. It's a hopeful speech.","[INTERVIEWER]. And one of the areas of Europe where liberty has been sort of partly transformative is clearly post-Soviet Russia. And you've had very strong personal relationship with Putin. First of all, is your assessment that Putin is still basically in charge? And how important is your personal relationship?","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me start with the second. My personal relationship is important because we had differences. And therefore, if you work hard to establish a relationship of trust, that you're then able to air out your differences in a way that's respectful of the other person, and at the same time, find common ground.","One area of common ground that has really not been given much attention is Iran. I agreed that the Iranians should have they have the sovereign right to have civilian nuclear power. Putin obviously believes they should; witness the cooperation on Bushehr. We both agree, however, that they can't be trusted with the knowledge that comes from enrichment. And therefore, Putin suggested to the Iranians that Russia provide the enriched uranium necessary to run their fuel plant. I agree. And as I said yesterday in the press conference, that this really undermines the argument for the Iranians because if, in fact, their only focus is on civilian nuclear power, they readily accept the plant, the fuel, and the offer of Russia to pick up the spent fuel.","So there are areas where we cooperate, and there are areas where we have disagreements. And yet I believe the best foreign policy for the American [INTERVIEWED] is to be in a position to earn the trust of those where there's not a hundred-percent agreement. And by the way, any American [INTERVIEWED] will find out there's never a hundred-percent agreement, even with your closest friends.","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm sure that's right.","[INTERVIEWED]. And so the first part of the question yes, look, I think it's I went to Sochi. Putin introduced me to Medvedev. And he, in not only his body language, but in his words to me that Medvedev is going to be in charge of foreign policy. And their relationship is being sorted out, and the world is fascinated to watch what's happening. I think it's I'll take him for his word, and then we'll watch and see what happens.","Religious Freedom","[INTERVIEWER]. How concerned are you about issues like human rights in Russia? And what degree of influence does any outside country even the United States or","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, I think it matters. I think it matters when people speak up, whether it be in Russia or China or anywhere else. In Russia's case, there was early on in my Presidency, I remember talking to Vladimir Putin on behalf of the Catholic Church, where there were concerns about the Church being able to have a robust presence.","Vladimir Putin is sensitive to religious issues. He's a religious guy himself. He has a beautiful little Orthodox church on his own property, which he proudly showed me and Laura one time. He made sure I met some of the Jewish community when I was there in Russia. And so he is sensitive to religious liberty, more so than some other countries.","Natural Resources/Multilateral Relations","[INTERVIEWER]. And is Western leverage reduced by the fact that Russia has a good chunk of the world's natural energy resources?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it certainly changes the equation on a lot of foreign policy. It's interesting to watch the European Union wrestle with energy independence. Early in my Presidency, nations were saying they were going to get rid of nuclear power. And I questioned them quietly, on an individual basis, about that decision, because if you get rid of one source of power, you have to find another source of power, unless, of course, you don't care whether your economy grows. Most leaders end up caring whether their economy grows.","So I predicted to some of these leaders that there would be an issue in terms of having a sole source supplier, particularly of natural gas from Russia. And now there's great consternation within the EU. And my only point is, is that this energy issue complicates a lot of foreign policy issues, including that between the EU and Russia, as well as that between the United States and Venezuela, or the world and Iran. And the question is, what do you do about it?","Energy Policy","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, that was going to be my next question.","[INTERVIEWED]. What we need to do about it in the United States is to get this Democratically controlled Congress to allow us to explore for oil and gas. We did an energy study when I first became [INTERVIEWED] that predicted it would be an issue if we did not explore for oil and gas. And what people don't understand is hydrocarbons are necessary as we transition to a new era, based upon new technologies. But new technologies don't arrive overnight. I mean, they just don't suddenly appear. It takes time and money to develop these technologies. The world is in the process of doing that. The United States is spending a lot of money on research, both privately and publicly. Japan is as well.","And yet we forgot the notion of transitioning. And so we don't explore in ANWR, we don't explore for oil shale, we don't explore off the coast of America, and we should be.","Oil Prices/Upcoming Middle East Oil Summit","[INTERVIEWER]. In terms of the oil price, which is obsessing most of the world now, is there anything individual governments can do, in your view?","[INTERVIEWED]. There's no magic wand. It took us a while to get to where we are; it's going to take us a while to get out of it. And the truth of the matter is that there's either got to be more supply or less demand. And demand doesn't decline overnight, although patterns and habits are beginning to change in the United States. You notice some of these car manufacturers are now announcing they're going to be manufacturing smaller automobiles.","I think that people have got to recognize that, I mean, our policy in America has been robust on the development of new technologies and weak on finding enough hydrocarbons so that we can become less dependent on foreign sources of oil.","[INTERVIEWER]. In terms of the short term, fixing the oil price","[INTERVIEWED]. You mean the magic wand?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, there's not one.","[INTERVIEWER]. And in terms of these conferences, I notice there's going to be a conference in Jeddah, and your national security staff","[INTERVIEWED]. That would be Hadley, the spokesman.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, indeed not unreasonably said that you would want to know what such a conference","[INTERVIEWED]. I was asked this at a press conference last night. I said it's an interesting idea. Of course, I'm going to go home and take a look at what it all means, and I'll decide who's going to attend on our behalf. But if I might repeat, the solution to the price of hydrocarbons is either more hydrocarbons or less usage of hydrocarbons.","During my trips to the Middle East I've got great relations with the leaders there, and I talked to King Abdallah about increasing the supply of oil, on the theory that if you harm your consumers with high price, they will find other ways to power their economies as quickly as possible. And secondly, he should not want to see kind of a worldwide contraction as a result of consumers spending money on energy that ends up overseas, as opposed to spending money on opportunities in their respective economies.","So I think people, if they take a sober look at the world's supply, there's just not a lot relative to demand.","One of the things that could help is that if some countries, big consumers of hydrocarbons stop subsidizing their populations so that there is a response to price on the demand side.","Iran","[INTERVIEWER]. Iran has been very much on the agenda again, all this week","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it is. It should be.","[INTERVIEWER]. and should be. Ahmadinejad has all but said no to the latest incentive package. If that stands, what's the next step in your view?","[INTERVIEWED]. More sanctions. The next step is for the Europeans and the United States and Russia and China to understand diplomacy only works if there are consequences. And sometimes the world tends to focus on the process as opposed to the results. And I have tried during my Presidency to say, we need to focus on the results. And for diplomacy to be consequential, there has to be a statement that says to the Iranians: Here's your way forward; if you choose not to, there will be a consequence. And the consequence in this case, in the diplomatic channel, is sanctions that are effective. So we will work with our partners on implementation of the sanctions thus far in place through the U.N., and work with them on additional sanctions, including through the U.N. process, as well as through the financial process.","[INTERVIEWER]. What's at stake here? Sorry, go on.","[INTERVIEWED]. On the theory that there are people inside Iran who, one, are suffering as a result of the decisions their Government made; but secondly, leaders inside of Iran who are sick and tired of the isolation brought about by this regime. In 2003, the Iranians had agreed to verifiably suspend; we had agreed to say, there's a way forward, working with our European partners. In other words, there was a looked like a successful way forward for both sides of this debate. Then Ahmadi-nejad gets elected, changes the tone and changes the policy.","And so my only point there is that and this is the point I make to our partners is that the Iranians had adopted a different attitude during my Presidency in other words, in the relatively near past and that's not to say they can't do it again. And now is the time. And the consequences of Iran having a nuclear weapon are substantial. They're substantial in the Middle East. If the people in the Middle East do not think that the United States and Europe, for example, are going to work to provide security, they will find their own ways to secure themselves. And what the Middle East does not need is a nuclear arms race. It does not need the instability that comes from an innate fear that the West is not strong enough or willing enough to take on the problem.","Situation in the Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. So there's a lot at stake here, in your view.","[INTERVIEWED]. In my judgment, it's the international issue that faces all of us. And therefore, success in Iraq is important; it has consequences for the Iranian issue. It is important for us to have security agreements with our friends. We, the United States, has security agreements with UAE, for example. When you go to the Middle East and you sit in my seat and listen, yes, there's concern about the Palestinian state. But the dialogue has shifted dramatically from solve the Palestinian state and you've solved the problems in the Middle East, to now solve the Iranian issue and you solve the problems in the Middle East.","Iran","[INTERVIEWER]. Let's assume that Ahmadinejad does not respond to this latest package, that there are additional sanctions. You clearly feel very strongly about this issue.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's why I put all options on the table.","[INTERVIEWER]. And there are other options, obviously. What happens if at the end of the year, you have tougher sanctions, but you still have no resolution?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't want to speculate on that. My hope is, is that let's get the tough sanctions in place. That's the task.","[INTERVIEWER]. But there's always an alternative on the table; there has to be.","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, yes, absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER]. And you","[INTERVIEWED]. And alternatives not just for the United States, alternatives for a lot of other countries, some of which the world needs to think about as we head into this arena. We don't want a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. That's an alternative.","U.S. Foreign Policy","[INTERVIEWER]. But you would be willing to hand over a status quo which was slightly improved, i.e., tougher sanctions?","[INTERVIEWED]. Actually, it's not status quo because there's a multilateral forum in place that will enable [INTERVIEWED]s to more likely deal with this issue. I have made it clear that it's difficult for the United States to achieve an issue in a one-on-one situation with people like Ahmadi-nejad or Kim Jong Il. I have changed the foreign policy of the United States to make it more multilateral because I understand that diplomacy without consequences is ineffective. And the only way to achieve consequences through diplomacy is for there to be a universal application, in this case, of sanctions. Unilateral sanctions don't work. You know, I tell my partners, we're asking you to sanction. I know you're sitting there saying to yourself, \"Well, it's easy for him to say because they've already sanctioned.\" And the question facing countries is, does money trump effective diplomacy for the sake of peace and security?","Progress in Iraq","[INTERVIEWER]. Iraq, you mentioned. Postsurge, are things heading in the right direction, in your view?","[INTERVIEWED]. Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER]. And how is","[INTERVIEWED]. Violence is down. And as a result of violence being down, the economy is growing and political reconciliation is taking place. And the lesson learned in this postconflict period in both Iraq and Afghanistan is, you got to have security.","I gave a speech at the Air Force Academy that said it's a different set of issues that we face now than we faced 60 years ago in postconflict. First of all, the conflicts took longer to resolve in World War II, and yet the reconstruction was done in relative peace and security. Here it took little time to accomplish the initial military objective, and reconstruction had to be done in the face of a lot of violence.","And in 2006, it became apparent that our strategy of training and encouraging the Iraqis to take the lead was not working; sectarian violence was severe. As you know, I made the decision to send 30,000 more in because we recognized that and had belief that security would yield this kind of evolution of democracy, and it is. The number of laws they passed, the Iraqi Parliament have passed, have been I would say it certainly exceeded expectations. And they passed their budgets faster than we have passed our budgets.","British and U.S. Troop Levels in Iraq","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm sure that's true.","The British Government, Gordon Brown had said yesterday, I think, that he will announce sometime in the coming weeks future plans for British deployment in Iraq. British officers have acknowledged that in the recent fighting in Basra, the American military role was crucial to making sure that there was a response. Is there not a concern that, whatever the justifications for a British withdrawal, that a British pullout of troops could have an effect either on American deployment or on the situation as a whole? Or are you relaxed about it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm, first of all, appreciative of the fact that Gordon Brown is constantly in dialogue with us about what he and his military are thinking. Secondly, we ourselves are bringing out troops based upon return on success. And thirdly, I am confident that he, like me, will listen to our commanders to make sure that the sacrifices that have gone forward won't be unraveled by drawdowns that may not be warranted at this point in time. I'm looking forward to discussing with him.","We've had some discussions. He was going to be at 3,500, I think, if I'm not mistaken; he's now at 5,000.","National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley. I think he's at 4,200.","[INTERVIEWED]. Forty-two-hundred, I don't know, whatever, but it's","[INTERVIEWER]. But it did roll back on an","[INTERVIEWED]. It's greater than he thought, in other words","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, that's right.","[INTERVIEWED]. In other words, the Government took a look and said, \"Well, maybe we ought to leave more troops in.\" My only point is, is that timetables you say, timetable for withdrawal, and our answer is, there should be no definitive timetable; there ought to be obviously a desire to reduce our presence, but it's got to be based upon success.","All I can tell you is, from my perspective, the British response has been that way. They've said, we're going to have we think we'll be at 3,500, but then adjusted their plans based upon the conditions.","Iraq/[INTERVIEWED]'s Decisionmaking","[INTERVIEWER]. Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq obviously is","[INTERVIEWED]. Still looking for them.","[INTERVIEWER]. Still looking for them, exactly.","[INTERVIEWED]. That was a huge disappointment.","[INTERVIEWER]. And the obvious question your critics ask, particularly in Britain, is if we'd known at the time there weren't any WMD, would there have been this war?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, that's one of those great hypotheticals that we didn't know. Now having said that, I still strongly defend the decision. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. But [INTERVIEWED]s don't get to do redos; they don't get to do look-backs, ifs. All I can tell you is, is that we thought for certain there was weapons of mass destruction, as did the nations that voted for 1441.","See, the interesting thing about history is that short-term, kind of momentary history, is that people forget what life was like at the moment that this decision was made. One, people forget that we tried to solve this problem diplomatically. You might remember, there was a great debate: Will Bush go to the United Nations, or will they move without trying to solve this problem diplomatically? Well, we did go to the United Nations; I insisted we go to the United Nations. And we worked diligently from the summer of 2002 until March of 2003 to see if we couldn't have solved this. We went back to the United Nations for a resolution.","[INTERVIEWER]. For a second resolution, yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. And in the meantime, we're working with our allies and friends. We didn't realize, nor did anybody else, that Saddam Hussein felt like he needed to play like he had weapons of mass destruction. It may have been, however, that in his mind all this was just a bluff. After all, there had been 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions, the world wasn't serious, which leads me back to the point that when the world says something, it better have it better mean what it says, otherwise people who are destabilizing just don't take it seriously. \"Who cares?\" they say.","And so I was asked in Germany one of the guys said, \"You making any mistakes?\" \"Of course,\" I said. One of the mistakes was my language made it look like that I was anxious for war; that because of my language, I didn't understand the consequences. Well, of course I understand the consequences. And I understand better than anybody that the Commander in Chief has got an obligation to comfort those who have lost a loved one because of his decision. And then the man went on and said, \"Well, was it a mistake to get rid of Sad-dam Hussein?\" The answer is absolutely not.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Decisionmaking","[INTERVIEWER]. You very movingly described in one interview this week that how difficult it is to put young American men and women in harm's way and how much time and energy you've tried to devote to doing what you can, obviously, to comfort the families of someone who has been killed","[INTERVIEWED]. And making sure they understand that the sacrifice won't go in vain. Nothing worse than a politician making decisions based upon the last Gallup poll when people's lives are at stake, or where they have made a sacrifice. And I tell these folks and they want to know look, there's a lot of them, and I haven't visited with all the families. But I will tell you this: Many, many families look at me trying to determine whether or not, one, I believed that it was necessary; and two, whether or not I'm going to let their son or daughter kind of lie in an empty grave when it comes to the sacrifice they made. They want to know whether or not the [INTERVIEWED] if he believes it was necessary, whether or not he's going to see this thing through, regardless of what they're screaming on the TV sets.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Image Abroad","[INTERVIEWER]. You're flying into Britain where your public awaits you, and you know there's a tough public there sometimes. One of the questions","[INTERVIEWED]. Do I care? Only to the extent that it affects people's view of my the citizens I represent. Do I care about my personal standing? Not really.","[INTERVIEWER]. One of the questions, of course, they ask, is, do you feel a sense of personal pain","[INTERVIEWED]. Course I do.","[INTERVIEWER]. over the Iraqi civilians who have","[INTERVIEWED]. I feel a sense of pain for those who were tortured by Saddam Hussein, by the parents who watched their daughters raped by Saddam Hussein, by those innocent civilians who have been killed by inadvertent allied action, by those who have been bombed by suicide bombers. I feel a sense of pain for death. I feel a sense of pain for the families of our troops. I read about it every night, or I used to read about it every night. The violence has changed.","But I get a report every day about whether or not the U.S. has suffered casualties. And when I get those reports, I think about those mothers and fathers. And I meet with a lot of families a lot in order to be able to it's my duty to try to console and comfort. And many times, the comforter in chief ends up being comforted, by the way, by the families, the strength of the families.","This is a volunteer army, and these kids are in this fight because they want to be in the fight. And they believe in it. And yet these poor parents are looking at oftentimes looking at negativity, just people quick to report the ugly and the negative. But it's hard to report on the schools that are opening or the clinics that are opening or the playgrounds that are filling up. The society is coming back.","I have great faith in the power of liberty. First of all, I wasn't surprised when people went to vote in defiance of the killers. I was pleased, but not surprised, because I believe in the universality of freedom. I don't believe it is a Western value. And I say to people, I am concerned about the comfortable isolating themselves and saying, who cares whether somebody over there lives in a free society?","And I'll say in my speech, moral relativism must be challenged, this notion that it doesn't matter what forms of government are I think it does matter. I think it also matters, along these lines, that when I talk about freedom, it's just not freedom from tyranny, it's freedom from HIV/AIDS; it's freedom from malaria; it's freedom from hunger for two reasons. One, it's in our national interests that we defeat hopelessness. The only way a suicide bomber can recruit is when he finds somebody hopeless. And secondly, it's in our moral interests. A nation is a better nation when it feeds the hungry and takes care of the diseased.","And therefore, when I go to the G-8, my message to the G-8 is, yes, we'll talk about the environment, and that's important. But George W. Bush is going to be talking about those people who are needlessly dying because of mosquito bites. And I expect them to honor their obligations. We came to the G-8 last year, and I said: \"Why don't you match what the United States of America does? We're putting up $30 billion for HIV/AIDS, $1.6 billion for malaria. And why don't you match us?\" And they said, \"Okay.\"","And so we're going to go to the G-8 and we're going to sit down and say, \"Have we matched?\" Because there are people needlessly dying today. And we'll come up with a good solution for greenhouse gases by getting China and India at the table. And it's going to take time to evolve, but I'm going to remind people we can act today to save lives for the good of the world.","[INTERVIEWED]. That means shorten my answers.","Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom","[INTERVIEWER]. No, no, I'll shorten my questions.","Just three very brief questions. First of all, your relationship with Tony Blair I'm struck, in your last question, that you seem to share with him a genuine passion for ideas and that politics matter. How would you describe your relationship with Blair?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would say, first of all, it's a relationship forged by fire. We share as you can tell, I have this idealistic streak, and so does Blair. But we also understand that this idealism is a practical response to the world. See, this is an he understands, like I understand, this is an ideological struggle. These acts are not isolated acts of lawlessness. We're in a war.","A lot of people hope this wasn't the war you know, just kind of dismiss it as, oh, there's some irritated guys, you know, just kind of making some moves. We viewed it as an ideological struggle that requires response through good intelligence, sometimes military, obviously, sometimes law enforcement, all aiming to dismantle and protect our people dismantle the cells and protect our people, but that ultimately, freedom has to defeat the ideology of hate.","[INTERVIEWER]. Was Tony Blair your poodle, to use the","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, look, this is the convenient one of the great things about Western press is that they oftentimes retreat to the convenient rather than trying to, you know, probe the depths of a relationship or the depths of somebody's feelings or the basis of philosophy. And so it's convenient. It's convenient to say, you know, \"warmonger,\" \"religious zealot,\" \"poodle.\" I mean, these are just words that people love to toss around foolishly.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Legacy","[INTERVIEWER]. How do you think and how do you hope that you and Blair but particularly yourself how would you hope that the achievement what's your greatest achievement or your greatest pride as [INTERVIEWED]? And what's your greatest regret?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, just so you know, I'm not going to be around to see it. There's no such thing as objective short-term history. It takes a while for history to have its you know, to be able to have enough time to look back to see why decisions were made and what their consequences were.","So you know, I'd hope it'd be somebody who would use the influence of the United States to help transform societies by working on disease and hunger and freedom. And the liberation of 50 million people from the clutches of barbaric regimes is noteworthy, at the minimum.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Beliefs","[INTERVIEWER]. Does this job take its toll on you? I mean, can you","[INTERVIEWED]. My spirits are pretty high. I mean, I'm you got to believe, you know? You got to have a set of beliefs that are the foundation for your very being. Otherwise these currents and tides and 24-hour news and politics will kind of leave you adrift. And I tell people that when I get home, I'm going to look in that mirror and say, I didn't sacrifice my core beliefs to satisfy critics or satisfy pundits or, you know","[INTERVIEWED]'s Future","[INTERVIEWER]. And what next a foundation, a book?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'm going to think about that, yes writing a book. I'm going to build a [INTERVIEWED]ial library with a freedom institute at SMU Southern Methodist University all aimed at promoting the universal values that need to be defended. I'm very worried about isolationism and protectionism. The world has gone through these \"isms\" before. And you watch and see, the protectionist debate is mounting in the United States; it's mounting in Europe, certainly. It was much easier to kind of blame the economic woes on external forces, and therefore, the response would be, okay, let's quit trade, let's make sure our jobs aren't going elsewhere, and that's some of those concerns are legitimate.","On the other hand, it is a forerunner of isolationism, and you know, I remind people that we've been through a period of isolationism and protectionism right before World War II. And, by the way, curiously enough, at that period of time, there was nativism as well. And I find it interesting that the immigration debate is now pretty pronounced around. And so I'm going to set up a this isn't, like, you know, a headquarters for the Republican Party.","And by the way, just so you know, the foreign policy I've just outlined for you is you know, it's not a hundred percent received amongst conservative thinkers in the United States either.","NBC's \"The West Wing\"","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, I know, yes. Do we have 90 seconds?","Ms. Perino. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay, so","Ms. Perino. I would say 90 seconds.","[INTERVIEWER]. Ninety seconds, okay. Just one very quick this is going to seem slightly flippant, but you're going to the greatest fan club of \"The West Wing\" television show in the world on Sunday. Since you're the only person who can review that program from experience","[INTERVIEWED]. I've never watched it.","[INTERVIEWER]. You're kidding. Why not?","[INTERVIEWED]. Because I don't watch network TV. I read.","[INTERVIEWER]. You read. Okay. And then the","[INTERVIEWED]. I seriously don't watch TV. You know, I watch sports, but I'd much rather read books. And I do, I read a lot. I may even read yours.","Progress in Iraq","[INTERVIEWER]. And then the last question","[INTERVIEWED]. But I won't be able to find it because it's written by so-called written by the other guy.","Q. Certainly true. Last question, which comes back to Iraq again. Gordon Brown and I thought your question on the pain you feel personally was quite clear and absolutely strong. Gordon Brown a couple weeks ago phoned a voter who was upset about Iraq, and apologized on behalf of the Government, not for the war, which he still thinks was the right thing, but for the kind of suffering of the Iraqi people. Do you think that's a wise thing to do?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think the Iraqi people yes, some have suffered, no question. But they're living in a free society. Everybody is going to have to handle their own internal business the way they want to. I'm not going to second-guess one way or the other. But my view is, is that when you talk to Iraqis, they're thrilled with the idea of living in a free society. Do they like the fact that violence is still there? No. But every society reaches a level of violence that's tolerable.","And has that reached Iraq? I don't know yet. But I do know life is improving. I do know they live under a Government that they helped elect, or they elected. And there's still a lot of work to be done, don't get me wrong, but and you know, the thing that people ought to focus on is the courage of the Iraqis. They put up with a lot of violence, Muslims killing Muslims. But first of all, there have been some accidents, but nobody can claim that the United States or Great Britain are intentionally killing innocent people. We're not. As a matter of fact, warfare has changed a lot.","[INTERVIEWER]. But the existence of the war has led to the deaths of innocent people, and the fact is","[INTERVIEWED]. It has, but before the war, hundreds of thousands were discovered in mass graves.","Freedom Agenda","[INTERVIEWER]. So on balance, you have","[INTERVIEWED]. Freedom trumps tyranny every time. And it's hard for people to see that. It's hard for people sitting afar to say, \"Isn't that beautiful, somebody lives in a free society?\" And my point is, is that I think it's important for those of us who do live in free societies to understand that others want to live in free societies. And it takes time and sacrifice and effort to get that done. But one of the lessons of history is, is free societies yield of peace.","I remind people, 60 years ago isn't all that long. And to say that Europe would be whole, free, and at peace prior to the end of World War II would have been, you know, you would have been viewed as a hopeless idealist. Well, I'm making the point that I when I gave my speech at the Knesset, if you read what I said, here's what 60 years from now the world can look like, and I believe will look like, unless we all retreat. It's not worth it, you know. And my point is, it's working.","[INTERVIEWER]. Good. Thank you very much. And thank you for taking so much time."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWED]. Hello?","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I want to give you the first question and to point out that the attention you've given our Senator Herb Kohl in the last couple of days has raised his level of notoriety to a point that he hasn't known since he was elected. Now, I know you wouldn't trade a vote, but is there anything that you and Senator Kohl mutually want in terms of legislation or other benefits for Wisconsin that you have an interest in?","[INTERVIEWED]. The main thing that Senator Kohl was concerned about—he was interested in two things, to be fair, and there was—in the national interest. One was to minimize the burden on middle class taxpayers. And when he looked at the whole package and saw that working families with incomes under $30,000 were held harmless and that working families with incomes of $50,000 and $60,000 were looking at a $33-a-year burden with the spending cuts, I think that really made a big difference to him.","The other thing that he was interested in that I think is certainly as significant over the long run is he wanted a program that had some real economic growth incentives, that had some business help in it. And this program does a lot for small businesses. Over 90 percent of the small businesses in the country are eligible for a tax reduction if they reinvest more money in their businesses. It does more for research and development. It does more for revitalizing homebuilding and real estate. It does more across a whole range of issues. For the heavy industry in Wisconsin, under this plan, there will be more incentives to invest in new plant and equipment in Wisconsin to be competitive there as opposed to going overseas. So all those things were important.","And then the third issue that he raised, which I certainly agree with him on, is that we need to bring this deficit down to zero. And in order to do that, we're going to have to cut more. But to do that, we have to reform the health care system. So the next issue is how to bring down health care costs so we can get this budget deficit down to zero and not just take $500 billion off of it.","[INTERVIEWER]. Have you convinced him, [INTERVIEWED], that these changes are enough to get his vote on this issue?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I hope so. I've worked hard on that. That's going to be up to him, not me, and I don't think I should speak for him. But let me say this: I think he has really done a good job here, and he has been very important in bringing a business, pro-jobs perspective to the whole debate. So we'll just see. But we've got a $495, $496, $497—something in that range—billion dollar deficit reduction package. We're now going to have more cuts than tax increases in the package. The top 1.2 percent of the American people, of people with incomes over $200,000 will pay more than 75 percent of the burden now. And there are quantifiable spending cuts now in excess of $250 billion across the whole range of Federal programs. So it is a very important first step here.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you haven't had quite as good a success with our Senator Boren, who, I think, like many people in Oklahoma are concerned that the spending cuts to come later— when we went through that in 1990, and they never came. Why should things be different this time?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, for one thing I'm going to have a trust fund and all the money will have to be put into the deficit reduction package, both the spending cuts and the tax increases. What actually happened in 1990, Jim, to be completely accurate about it, is that the Congress adopted a plan based on the previous administration's rosy revenue estimates. And no one really thought the revenues would grow that much; so they didn't. And then spending increased because the recession went on and more people were entitled to Medicare and Medicaid. And between those two things, they were in deep trouble.","Now, let me just address the major objections Senator Boren has, because I think what he says is right, but it's not a good reason to vote against this program. What he says is that in order to take the deficit from where we're taking it down to zero, you have to do something about the entitlement programs, especially about Medicare and Medicaid. Now, that is true. But the problem is if you don't reform the health care system, that is, if you don't fundamentally restructure the system of the way health care is insured against and the way the—cutting out a lot of the paperwork and a lot of the things that are more expensive in America than anywhere else that have nothing to do with health care, and you cut the medical expenses of the Federal Government, all in the world you're going to do is have a hidden tax on the private sector because the providers will do what they always do. They'll pass their costs on to people that have insurance. So that, for example, the Daily Oklahoman would have its medical premiums go up more than otherwise would be the case because the Government's not paying the full cost of its health care.","So I don't disagree that we have to do something about health care costs and entitlements. But the time to do that is in the context of a health care reform debate, which we're going to start as soon as we can get this budget out of the way. If we don't adopt the budget, we'll never get there. Everybody who looks at it can see that this budget's a lot better deal than the one in 1990. The numbers are more realistic. The growth package is realistic. We've got new business capital gains tax in there and all kinds of other incentives for small businesses to grow. Over 90 percent of the small businesses can get a tax reduction under this plan because of it. This is going to create some jobs, too. So it's a better package.","But you can't solve all the problems of the world in this bill. That's my quarrel and dispute with Senator Boren. He's right, you've got to get the entitlements if you want to go to zero, but we're going to have to do it in two steps, not one.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a lot of people are concerned with, out here, the fact that the spending reductions, the major ones, seem to come so late in the plan, and the tax increases come so early. Wouldn't it be better to go back in and make another slash, even if this means delaying the budget a little bit?","[INTERVIEWED]. Here's the problem with it: First of all, there are going to be more spending reductions all the way along. The House of Representatives has already approved $10 billion in spending reductions over and above what's in this budget, but working with me. I've encouraged them. The Vice President is going to have a reinventing Government report out sometime next month, which will provide a lot more savings. So we're just getting started on the spending reductions. And then as I said, we'll be able to project a decade of spending controls in the health care area if we do health care reform.","The problem is that no matter what you do with that, the budget we have now and the budget we're going to have next year—we're already preparing to cut more off next year right now. But that is not an excuse not to act now. Still the big reductions in spending are those that aggregate up over time. That is, if I cut $10 billion this year and $10 billion next year, then that's $20 billion over this year's figure and then $30 billion and $40 billion. You see what I mean? So the spending cuts are always going to look bigger in the out-years because they compound one another.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], we're relaying some of our readers' questions. One of them was, how can the job market grow when small businesses are afraid new taxes and the health plan will put them out of business?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, new taxes and the health plan won't put them out of business. We've tried to send a clear signal to the small business community that there won't be a tax problem here. But if they have to have a premium to cover their own employees, we will limit how much of their payroll it can be, and it will be phased in over a period of years.","But let me flip it over to you on the other side. Seventy percent of the small businesses in America provide some health care coverage for their employees, and almost all of them pay much more than they should because we're the only country in the world that forces employers who cover their employees to subsidize employers who don't, and that's what happens. Everybody in this country gets health care, but if you don't have health insurance and you can't pay for it, you get it too late when it's too expensive. You show up at the hospital; you get cared for, and then the providers, the doctors and the hospitals, in effect, raise their costs to everybody else. So you could argue that the small business community as a whole in this country is more hurt by the system we have than by the one we're moving to.","Also, let me make one other point. We spend about 10 cents on the dollar more than any other country in the administrative costs of our health care system because we have 1,500 separate health insurance companies writing thousands of different policies, all with different rules and regulations, so that the cost of compliance is staggering, and then the Government aggravates it.","So I think the small business community will wind up ahead on this. But we've tried to send some clear signals that we're not going to pop them with a big payroll tax, and I do think employers who don't provide anything for their employees should bear some responsibility through the private insurance system. But it ought to be limited and phased in so that nobody goes broke doing it.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], on Friday, last Friday we had a conversation with Roger Altman about your budget plan, and one of the questions we asked him was what the administration would have done differently to sell this plan. And he was very frank about it. He said, \"We would have started a lot earlier.\" And I'm curious in terms of your strategy why you didn't really start giving everybody the hard sell a lot earlier.","[INTERVIEWED]. You mean not in the Congress but in the country?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, talking to the people.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, actually we did a lot of that, but we didn't have our war room set up, and we were, frankly, just overwhelmed by the day-to-day news coverage of Republicans carping about taxes and unable to kind of break through about what the facts of the program were.","I worked hard—for 2 months after I made my State of the Union Address I went out into the country once a week. I did my best to talk about the program. But we didn't have the kind of organized disciplined effort we've had for the last few weeks in reaching out to local newspapers and television and radio stations and bringing in opinion leaders and doing all these things we're doing now. And I think we did lose control of the debate. Also, to be fair to them, to Roger Altman and the others, an issue like this tends to go through cycles. I told the people about it on February 17th, and they liked it. Then the sort of negative rhetoric took over. Now we're kind of coming back to reality, and all the surveys show we're bringing it back our way now.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], Alan Greenspan has been giving some subliminal signals about raising interest rates. Wouldn't that sort of derail your plan for reducing the deficit if the interest rates went up? And are you worried about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am. I don't think you should raise interest rates until there's real economic growth that brings on real inflation. I mean, there's no real inflation in this economy, and we can have growth without inflation. And I think we may be reading too much into his remarks.","[INTERVIEWER]. Have you talked to him directly about what he did mean since he made those remarks?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, but I talk to him fairly often, and I'm scheduled to have another session with him pretty soon. I know him pretty well, and my read on what he said was if inflation warranted it, he might raise interest rates. But if you think about it, what we're trying to do in bringing the deficit down is to justify keeping the interest rates down even when there's economic growth because the Federal Government will be taking less capital away from the markets, and therefore, there won't be as much competition for it, and we ought to be able to keep lower interest rates. That's our theory. He has constantly and consistently supported the deficit reduction efforts of this administration in very explicit terms. So I would be surprised to see him raise interest rates when we're doing something to support the reverse. If we were having 4 or 5 percent growth and inflation was getting out of hand, I could understand it. But there's no grounds for it now.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], obviously, in this part of the country it would have been more popular to cut spending first, raise revenue later. You used the early year forecast of the deficit to go back on your pledge for a middle class tax cut. Since, there have been other estimates, why haven't you gone back to a cut spending first program?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, we are cutting spending. We are cutting spending. This idea that we're raising taxes—taxes come in constant amounts, whether it's a fuel tax or an income tax.","This is a dodge. David Stockman, who pioneered Reagan's program in 1981, has now admitted in repeated interviews that they cut taxes twice as much as they meant to because they got into a bidding war with Congress, that there is no way to restore any kind of fairness to the Tax Code or reduce the deficit to zero unless there is a revenue component. So if I were to say, \"Okay, we'll put these spending cuts in for a couple of years, and then we'll raise taxes,\" all we would do by doing that is basically have a bigger deficit in the first years because we'd have the spending cuts but not the taxes, and we would have higher interest rates, and we'd have slower economic recovery.","Let me just say, in the year that I'm in now— which I'm not even responsible for this budget until October the 1st—our deficit is going to be about $25 billion less than it was predicted to be when I became [INTERVIEWED].","But to go back to the middle class tax argument, after the election but before I took office, the previous administration said, \"Oh, by the way, the deficit's going to be $165 billion bigger over the next 5 years.\" So I always in that campaign said I am not going to say \"read my lips\" because I've run a government long enough at the State level to know that sometimes circumstances can change on you. I've been very candid with the American people about that. I think most people with incomes of $50,000 a year don't think $33 a year is too much to pay. I think what most people have believed is, they've been told that they're going to be paying a fortune. And","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]","[INTERVIEWED]. Now, wait a minute. Let me just finish this. I want to make this point. I'm going to be [INTERVIEWED] 4 years. We've got opportunities to have even more fairness in the Tax Code if we're bringing down the deficit and we are opening up economic growth. There are all kind of options to do things over the next 4 years. But the most important thing now is to do something about the deficit. The truth is that all these people who say they want to cut spending now, what they really want is an accounting practice which still would have all the spending cuts come in the 3d, 4th, and 5th year of this budget cycle.","What they're really saying is let's pass a bill that says it's going to cut spending later now before we raise taxes. They don't propose more spending cuts in these first years than I do, none of them do. And to go back to Senator Boren's bill, particularly the one he offered in the Senate didn't have nearly as much support as the one I offered, because it didn't have the kind of deficit reduction unless you did what he proposed to do, which was to take more out of Medicare for middle class people. And even then it wasn't going to happen for the 3d, 4th, or 5th year, most of it.","So the people that say cut spending now are saying, \"We don't want to cut any more spending than Bill Clinton does right now, but we want to pass a bill that cuts spending in the 3d, 4th, and 5th year in health care without health care reform and then talk about whether we should tax the wealthiest Americans later.\" That's what they're really saying.","[INTERVIEWER]. Is there any chance, do you think, that this bill will go down? Is there any chance that it will not pass in the Senate?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, sure there is. But I think it will pass. And the reason I think it will pass is this: I think most of those people are going to say, is this a better bill than we've ever had before and better than we had in 1990? And the answer to that will be, yes. Is this fairer to average Americans than the ones we've been considering? The answer to that will be, yes. Does this restore some economic growth incentives for small business, for new high-tech businesses, for housing, for real estate that we haven't had in the Tax Code for 7 or 8 years? And the answer to that will be, yes. Does this bill lift the working poor out of poverty and encourage people to get off welfare, not with a Government program but by using the tax system to reward people who work, even at very low wages? The answer to that will be, yes. And then the last question is, do we want to hang around here in Washington for 60 or 90 more days and debate this, and either come back here and pass something very like it or something that's so much weaker that we'll have higher interest rates, more uncertainty, and we'll waste 2 or 3 months when we could be dealing with health care, with welfare reform, with a crime bill, with things that will grow this economy with a new world trade agreement, all these things we need to get on about the business of doing.","We are literally paralyzed here. We can't get anything else done. The only other major initiative that's going to come out of this is the national service bill that I've been working on for a long time. Other things cannot even be dealt with.","And again I want to say to those of you interested in the cut issue, keep in mind the Vice President is going to issue our reinventing Government report within 60 days. The Congress is still cutting some other spending with my strong support. We are going to have more cuts even than we have now. But to delay this program is a great mistake. All it will do is paralyze the Government, paralyze the financial markets, and leave us with uncertainty. We've been talking about this since February. It's time to move."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnewspapereditors0","text":["About Search","[INTERVIEWER1].  As you are well aware, Louisiana's Senator, Bennett Johnston, is or was at last report among the small, key group of Democrat Senators who've indicated reluctance to vote for your deficit reduction package. What are you doing or what can you do to get Senator Johnston's vote? And do you think you will ultimately get it?","[INTERVIEWED] . I don't know the answer to the last question, but what I've done is to try to take the strengths of both House and Senate versions of the bill and try to put them together. The strength of the Senate version was it had fewer overall taxes and was even more progressive. The strength of the House version was it had much more economic incentives, more economic growth incentives, for research and development, for investment in new firms, for small business, the things of that kind.","So the argument that I'm going to be making to all these Senators is that this plan now clearly has $500 billion in deficit reduction; it will now have more spending cuts than tax increases in it; it will have over 75 percent of the new tax burden now borne by people with incomes above $200,000; that the middle class tax burden is now down to $33 a year; and that the economic growth incentives qualifying, for example, 90 percent plus of the small businesses in the country for a reduction in taxes if they invest more in their companies; and enabling the working poor through the earned-income tax credit to lift themselves above poverty by working full time, these are very, very important things. And the time has come to act.","Now, let me say just as a generic thing, since this may help to shape some of the other questions: The people who are leaning against this program or have announced against it—not the Republicans, that's almost entirely a political deal; the Republicans have even opposed the conservative amendments to our budget to control entitlements and impose discipline. But the Democrats basically fall into two categories: There are those who think it's the right thing for the country, but they're afraid there's been so much misinformation out there about it that they'll get beat if they vote for it. And then there are those who think that it's a good first step, but it doesn't go far enough.","The only thing I would say to the latter group is that we do have to do something on entitlements, but we can't get there until we do something to reform health care spending overall, and that this is a major step that will stabilize the financial markets, keep interest rates down, and enable us to move on to health care reform, to getting a world trade agreement, to welfare reform, to the crime bill, to all these things that are out there crying for attention that we can't even address if we don't go ahead and get this budget out of the way. And also, there will be further budget cuts. The Vice President's report on reinventing Government is due next month. It will have many more suggested budget cuts. And the House of Representatives has already cut another $10 billion off the budget that we can't fully count yet because the Senate hasn't acted. But when they do, we'll have even more cuts.","[INTERVIEWER 1].  [INTERVIEWED], good afternoon.","[INTERVIEWED] . Good afternoon.","[INTERVIEWER 1].  Let me pass on to you a question I'm getting increasingly from Constitution readers. How can you assure that your tax increase package does not have the same result as Mr. Bush's 1990 tax increase package, which is to say no result at all except higher taxes?","[INTERVIEWED] . I can do that in two ways. First of all, let's look at what happened in 1990. Why did the deficit reduction package in 1990 not produce the deficit reduction it was intended to? There were basically two or three reasons. But one big reason is that they overestimated how much the revenues would bring in; that is, they had some very, very liberal revenue estimates, and those revenues did not materialize. So that within 60 days after the package passed, they revised downward the amount of deficit reduction by $130 billion. Now, we have instead taken the most conservative revenue estimates we could get.","The second thing is that I have pledged to the Congress that by Executive order, I will put all of this money, the spending cuts and the revenue increases, into a trust fund and that every year if we miss the deficit reduction target, I will come forward to the Congress and give them a plan to meet the target, that is, to have further cuts to meet the target, and ask them to vote on it. I might say that we had those requirements in the law, and through the parliamentary rules of the Senate, the Republicans took it out of the law. One hundred percent of the Republicans agree with that budgetary discipline, and they took it out because they thought it was good politics for them to take it out and weaken the bill further. So I'm going to do it by Executive order. So it is different.","Now, let me say, there was one other thing different from 1990. Because this plan has been taken much more seriously by the financial markets, it has already had a big impact in bringing down long-term interest rates, and that has led millions of people to refinance their homes and their business loans. And I'm convinced once we actually pass the plan, we'll release a lot of investment into the economy. The other thing we do that was not done in 1990 is have investment incentives: the 75-percent in small business expensing—that will qualify over 90 percent of the small businesses in the country for a tax cut if they invest more in their business; a new business capital gains tax which will really help in high technology areas; we've got incentives to reinvest in homebuilding and to reinvest in new plant and equipment through changes in the alternative minimum tax. So there are a lot of pro-growth incentives in this plan that were not there in 1990, and those are the principal differences.","[INTERVIEWER 2].  [INTERVIEWED], good afternoon. Ross Perot is saying that this proposal should be rejected so Members of Congress can go back home, visit with their constituents, get a better feel for the spending cuts that would be accepted, come back in September and cut some more. Why should that not be done?","[INTERVIEWED] . Well, because we've already got more spending cuts than revenue increases, number one; because we're going to keep cutting spending, as I have said. But no one who looks at this budget deficit believes it can seriously be brought under control unless there are some revenue increases. And you know, I think it's pretty funny—I mean, I've got a 4.3 cent gas tax in my plan. Ross Perot proposed a dime a year for 5 years or a 50 cent gas tax increase in his plan, something he was running from yesterday on television. I have more verifiable spending cuts than he proposed in his plan. We have done what we need to do here to get a budget out.","Here is the problem: Nothing precludes us from cutting more spending. We're going to cut more spending. But until we pass this budget, we are paralyzed from going on to the next big problem with the deficit, which is health care costs and entitlements there. And that's got to be dealt with in the context of health care reform. We can't get to health care reform; we can't consider the next big round of spending cuts through reinventing Government; we can't do the crime bill, which is very, very important; we can't do welfare reform; we can't do anything until we pass a budget. And we've debated this from February to August. These Members have been going home every weekend. There will be more spending cuts. There will be more spending cuts in every year I'm here. But the time has come to pass this budget and get on with it. The tax burden is fair. Spending cuts now will exceed the tax increases. And we're going to put it all against the deficit. And we've just got to do this so we can go on and do the rest of it. To keep wallowing around in it won't serve anybody very well.","[INTERVIEWER 2].  What do you do about Mr. Perot?","[INTERVIEWED] . Well, nothing. He doesn't have a vote in Congress. I think what was done yesterday was wonderful. The press kept saying, \"Well, what would you do? Here's your plan; how can you criticize [INTERVIEWED] ? Yours was off by $400 billion. You're going to raise the gas tax by 50 cents.\" And so I don't have to do anything. I think, you know, it was nice to see him answer some questions for a change. There's nothing for me to do. I've got a plan, and it'll work, and I want to pass it. And it's good for the country.","Let me just say this: We had 67 business executives here from big and small companies last week, 4 energy company executives—half of them were Republicans, one of them was President Bush's cochairman—supporting this plan. And every one of them said we've got to do it because we've got to bring the deficit down, we've got to keep interest rates down, we've got to stabilize the economy, we need some incentives to grow—every one of them. I mean, there is very broad support for this program among people who really understand it.","When I went to Tokyo to meet with the leaders of other industrial nations at the G-7 summit, for 10 years the statement coming out of that meeting had criticized the United States for its budget deficit. For the first time in 10 years, they complimented the United States. And they agree with me that we ought to go and try to get the 111 countries that are in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to lower tariffs on a whole range of issues, eliminate them on a lot of other products. And everybody concedes, who's studied this, that this could add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the American manufacturing sector this year. Why? Because we're doing something about our deficit.","We have got to move. We don't need to delay this another month or 2 months or 3 months. That's what they did in 1990, by the way. One of your questions was what didn't work in 1990. In 1990 they said, well, we just can't make up our mind, so we'll delay. So instead of adopting it in August, they adopted it at the end of October. That's 90 precious days almost from the first week in August to the end of October, 90 days we could be dealing with health care; we could be passing the Vice President's recommendations on reinventing Government, which would be even more spending cuts; we could be passing a crime bill to help make our streets safer; that we could be dealing with welfare reform; all these things to strengthen the economy. None of this can be done unless we get this out of the way.","[INTERVIEWER 2].  Sir, there's been a good bit of discussion about the timing of the spending cuts, particularly saying that they mostly come in the later years. Could you please comment on the timing of the spending cuts?","[INTERVIEWED] . Well, they weren't timed to do that. The fact is that we have more control— when I took over this budget—these budgets are done on a 5-year cycle. If you're going to make deep cuts, it's easier to plan for them if you have a little time to plan for them. And also under the previous budget that we inherited, the budgets were already tighter in the early years, and they were much looser, I thought, in the later years.","But I assure you, we're not waiting for that. I've already given instructions to my Cabinet to prepare more budget cuts for the coming year. We have reduced the deficit in this year since I've been in office, mostly because of lower interest rates, by about $25 billion over and above where it was projected to be. So there are budget cuts in the early years, but it's like planning anything else. If you're going to take big whacks out of a large organization, the longer time goes on, the more you have to plan, the bigger the cuts you can make.","Now, let me say one other thing. Other people talk about \"cut first and tax later;\" most of their cuts are in the later years, too. They just want to pass them first and then avoid the tough decisions on the taxes. But if you look at the cuts that are proposed by others, if you look at Senator Boren's cuts on entitlements, almost all of them come in the later years, the meaningful ones. That's where they come, except the proposals that would have raised the costs of health care to middle class Medicare recipients or upper class ones. I'm not against, for example, raising the premiums on Part B. That's what he called a spending cut. But if you're going to do it, it ought to be done in the context of overall health care reform and not just trying to get more money from those folks. I think we need to reform the health care system.","The people who talk about spending cuts first are basically saying this. If you ask the people who say they're opposed to this but they understand the budget, they will tell you the following things: We are cutting defense sharply and about all we can. I'm concerned that we should not do more. We've cut it quite deeply. There is an overall freeze on domestic spending. For example, that means every dollar we increase Head Start, every dollar we increase education and training for workers that have been displaced by defense plants closing down, every dollar we put into new technologies for defense conversion—those are the three areas where we basically have increased—we have to cut in veterans affairs, in agriculture, in all these other areas. Already we have a budget that will reduce the Federal work force by over 100,000 people in the next 5 years, and there will be more cuts coming to that, so that's flat.","The only thing that's increasing in this budget are the so-called entitlements, and that's basically Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security cost of living. We have restrained Federal pay increases and Federal pension increases below where they have been under the previous administrations. They are getting some cost of living, but less than they ordinarily would, and I called for a freeze in the first year. So the real growth is in Medicare and Medicaid, in the health care programs. If you put a lid on them now without reforming the health care system, you must do one of two things that I think are not good. One is to charge middle class elderly people more for their Medicare and much more if you're going to make them pay it all. Or the second is to not charge them any more, just limit how much the Federal Government pays, and force the doctors and hospitals to shift all the costs to the private sector, which would raise the health insurance premiums of every newspaper on this telephone. That's what's been going on for years.","I guess I need to say this as clearly as I can: I do not dispute those who say if you want to take the deficit from where I take it to down to zero, you have to deal with entitlements. And it will require more spending cuts, not more tax increases beyond where we are. I agree with that. But my point is you don't get to that until you do this first. You've got to pass the budget first, then reform the health care spending in the country. Otherwise, what's going to happen with health care cuts, it's going to be very, very unfair to the elderly on Medicare or to people who are paying private insurance. They're going to bear the costs.","Space Station and Super Collider","[INTERVIEWER 3].  [INTERVIEWED], down here you're talking about budget cutting in Texas; that means two things basically, the SSC and the space station. How do you see their future? Are they going to hang in there? And if push comes to shove, how would you put them in priority of importance if you have to keep one and get rid of one?","[INTERVIEWED] . Well, let me just say this. They're both very important to me for different reasons. And I think they're both important to the country. I think, if you're asking how they're doing now, I think the space station is more secure than the super collider, because the space station passed a House vote. It was a narrow vote, as you probably know, the first time. The second time we got some more votes. But the first time we only carried it by a couple of votes when two good friends of mine who went down to vote against it stayed to the end and changed their vote so we could save it because they knew it was important to me and, I think, to the country, as I said.","So we have redesigned the space station after a serious review by an eminent team of national scientists. It is very important to maintain our leadership in space technology. It's very important in terms of new partnerships with Russia to keep them involved in this kind of technology, to reduce the incentive they have to sell weapons and keep them taking their nuclear force down. But most important, it's a big economic boom to us. If we get out of this, the Europeans will move right in, take this over, and have a lot of those high-wage jobs that Americans should have. So I think it is critically important.","The super collider is important, in my judgment, for science and for research, not so much for applied technology now. We don't know for sure what it will produce, but we know that it has the potential to produce a great deal, and we know that other major science research projects like this have often had unintended benefits.","It's in more trouble now. And frankly, whether we can save it or not depends entirely on whether we can save it in the Senate. And the climate's not as good as it was last year when it was saved. I think then-Senator Bentsen clearly saved it in the Senate last time. It got beat by 70 more votes in the House this time than it did last year. I really don't know whether that's the real sentiment of the House or not. And then I don't know how much that had to do with the fact that, at the moment they were voting on the super collider, your Senators and Mr. Perot were out on the steps of the Capitol screaming at them to cut more spending, at the very moment the bill came up. I don't know whether that had anything to do with it or not, but I know it lost by 70 more votes than it did last year.","And you know, it's pretty tense in the Senate now over a lot of these issues. But I am strongly supporting it. I'm going to do what I can to pass it, and I think we've got a chance to pass it. The key to passing it, frankly, is asking the Senate to look at the national interest and look at the fact that we have to make a significant investment in nondefense research and development and technology. Now that we've cut defense a great deal and we have not offset all the cuts in technology with domestic investments in technology, and that's where a lot of these high wage jobs of the future come from, we can't permit this to become a debate where the people in California took 40 percent of the base closing cuts last time and they complained that Texas took no cuts and that they're voting for new revenues and the Texas Senators want— I mean, if it becomes a deal, you know, a Stateby-State deal, I think it's gone. The only way we can save it is if people will recognize that it is in the national interest to do so. I'm hoping we can do it.","[INTERVIEWER 3].  There's time for one more question.","[INTERVIEWED] . I can't believe all these editorial writers don't have another question.","Economic Program","[INTERVIEWER1].  You spoke about now having more spending cuts than tax increases. I wonder if you could give us the figures, the current state of affairs.","[INTERVIEWED] . Well, you know, they're still negotiating. It could change, but the last time I talked to Senator Mitchell it was about $254 billion in spending cuts and about $242 billion or $241 in taxes, or something like that. They were at about $496 billion. And like I said, it could change in the next few days, but— I mean in the next day or so. You know, let me close by, if I might—you asked me a question when you started, and I didn't really give you a very good answer about how I could get Senator Johnston's vote. I think, frankly, he's worried about looking like he reversed himself from voting against it the first time, and I can understand that.","But let me say, without identifying anybody, if you look at the people who have opposed the program or the people who voted for it with reluctance, their basic objections break down into two categories. One is a political one, pure and simple: \"I think this is the right thing to do for the country, and I hope it passes, but I'm scared I'll get beat if I vote for it.\" And we have tried to help in several ways: first of all, by recreating an aggressive communications strategy, more like what we did in the campaign, to try to combat what we think are false claims against this plan and just to get the information out about it; and secondly, to ask everybody to imagine what it's going to be like, not the day after the vote but after we've had a chance to continue our spending cut program through the Vice President's reinventing Government initiative and through other cuts that will come when we've got a chance to deal with health care and welfare reform and the crime bill and these other issues.","Then there's a whole second category of people who say that this is okay, this is a legitimate and honest effort to do better, and it does, but it doesn't do enough. Senator Nunn, for example—we've got the Atlanta Journal on here— Senator Nunn is sort of in that category, you know, said you've got to deal with entitlement costs, too. And my argument to that group of people—and that's the argument that Senator Boren made yesterday—is that you're right, it doesn't do enough. But that's not a good reason to vote against this because what it does is very good, indeed. And unless you do this, you can't get to the second stage. That is, I completely agree we have to control entitlement costs and that that begins overwhelmingly with Medicare and Medicaid costs. I just don't think it's fair or right to do it unless it's part of an overall health care reform plan which brings down the cost of health care to all Americans and stops cost-shifting and doesn't impose unfair burdens on elderly people on Medicare. And my argument is, we're just beginning this process; we're not ending it. But if we don't pass this budget now, we'll fool around here for 60 or 90 more days debating the same old thing. We'll wind up with a program that may be marginally different than the one we've got, but it will in all probability have much less deficit reduction if we have to go into some sort of situation where we're paralyzed on this.","So the real issue here—I think the reason that we've had so many Republican as well as Democratic business leaders supporting this is that they want a decision, they want certainty, they want real deficit reduction, and they think this meets all those criteria and also has some real incentives to grow the economy, and it will free us to move on to these other things. That's what I keep emphasizing to Members of Congress who say this is not perfect. I say, look, we've got a 4-year contract here to deal with all these problems, and you can't expect this one bill to solve all the problems of the country. It won't carry that much water. But this is very, very important, but only a first step.","Health Care Reform","[INTERVIEWER 4]. [INTERVIEWED], since you brought up health care reform, what do you say to reassure Americans—looming over this budget package with its various tax increases is the specter of more increases to pay for health care. How can you reassure Americans that they're not getting ready to get hit by a one-two punch?","[INTERVIEWED] . First of all, I think we tried to be pretty clear from the beginning that a cigarette tax was just about the only thing we had under consideration to deal with the Government's part of this responsibility, which is how to provide health care for the unemployed uninsured.","Now, the other big question that the small business community raised is what's going to happen to the employed uninsured, virtually all of whom work for small businesses. And I don't, myself, think that it's right to raise everybody else's taxes to cover those people because everybody else is paying too much already. I do think that if we're going to join the ranks of every other advanced country in the world and we're going to bring our costs down, we've got to cover everybody. An employer should bear some responsibility for their employees. And the employee should bear some responsibility, too. But my own view of that is that the best way to do that is to limit the ultimate cost to small business and phase any new requirements in over a period of years so that nobody is adversely affected too much.","But let me say on that point, it's important to remember that 70 percent of the small businesses in America already provide some coverage to their employees. Most of them pay too much for too little coverage because of the way our insurance market is organized. Most of them, in other words, are disadvantaged by the present system. For those who don't provide any coverage for themselves or their employees, they still get health care. But if they can't pay for it, the cost of that health care is simply shifted onto everybody else by the providers.","So my argument there is that we're going to do this with extreme sensitivity to the economy. I think that most business groups will like this program. I think most provider groups will like the program. And I think everybody recognizes that there's something badly wrong when we're spending over 14 percent of our income as a country every year on health care and no other country in the world except for Canada is even over 9. They're just barely over 9. We're competing with the Germans, who are at 8, and the Japanese, who are 8 percent of their income. And with no discernible effect on our life expectancy or anything else—we've got some serious problems they don't have.","Now, we'll never get down to where they are because we have more poor people, more violence, and because for good reasons we emphasize more technology and breakthroughs. So we'll never get down to where they are, but we have got to bring these costs under control or the deficit will never get down to zero, and we can't really restore the competitiveness of our private sector.","So I would say that people should look forward to this with eagerness. Also, this is not going to be jammed through the Congress overnight. We're going to have an honest and open debate on this. I want the American community to sit down and really visit about this health care thing and talk it through. This is not going to be some sort of a blitzkrieg deal. We're going to take some time and really discuss it and debate it, just as we have for the last 6 months.","Thank you very much."," "]}

Yes. Good evening, [INTERVIEWED] .","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Good evening.","[INTERVIEWED] 's Visit to Vietnam","[INTERVIEWER]. You must be very exhausted by now. That is why we are so grateful for you to grant RFA your very first post-Vietnam interview.","My name is Nguyen Bich, or you can call me just Bich for short. And I am the director of the Vietnamese service at Radio Free Asia. And sitting by me in our studio is Dan Sutherland, who is vice president for programming.","So, [INTERVIEWED] , my first question to you is, how do you feel? Do you feel you have accomplished your goal by this first trip ever made by a [INTERVIEWED] of the United States to a reunified Vietnam?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I think it was a very successful trip; first, because we were able to see and support the attempts that are being made there to recover the missing in action from the Vietnam conflict and to continue our cooperation with the Vietnamese Government in that regard.","We also gave them several hundred thousand pages of documents to help them identify the some 300,000 people still missing who are Vietnamese. Then, I think it was important because we contributed, I believe, to the continuing economic progress of the country which I think will lead to more openness.","And thirdly, I think it was important because I was able to speak on television to the country about the kind of future I hope we will share with Vietnam and the fact that I hope there will be more openness and more freedom in it. And I also had, finally, some very good discussions and some constructive disagreements with the leadership of Vietnam.","[INTERVIEWED] 's Impressions of Vietnam","[INTERVIEWER]. Your speech at Hanoi University certainly was very impressive. And so I think that made a really big impression on the country. As this was your first trip to Vietnam, could you give us a general impression of the country, at least what you saw of it, and of the people? Were they warm and welcoming?","[INTERVIEWED]. They were very warm and very welcoming and clearly interested in the trip. And the young people with whom I talked were clearly interested in having closer ties with America. So I felt very good about that.","I also was interested in all the changes that are occurring in the northern part of the country. I think there's clearly a lot of new investment going on in Hanoi, a lot of new businesses coming out, a lot of changes there that I think will tend to make the south and the north perhaps less different in terms of the economic lives and maybe the political outlooks of the people at least in the cities. Now, the only village that I went to was the one where the search for the pilot was going on.","Economic Future of Vietnam","[INTERVIEWER]. People say that, in Vietnam, it is still some distance between the potential and realization. Do you get a feeling that the people are impatient for progress, especially among the young, or do you think, as the Government says, that they are pretty satisfied with the present pace of things?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would say that they understand that the country is doing better, and they like that. But my impression is that they want to move forward as rapidly as they can. After all, 60 percent of the country now is under 30. And I think they have a keen awareness that they have to make a lot of changes in order to keep creating jobs. I think they need 1.4 million new jobs every year.","On the morning of my last day there, I had an amazing roundtable discussion with a number of young Vietnamese men and women who ranged in age from early twenties to midthirties, and who did everything from working for Cargill, the big international grain company, to running the Vietnam office of Saachi and Saachi, which is a big London advertising agencyexcuse me.","Then there was one young man who had a job in the party and others who had other jobs. But what was interesting to me is, they were all thinking about the big questions, you know, how much personal freedom is needed in life, what kinds of decisions should be made by the individual, and what kind of decisions should be made by families or villages or the nation, the Government, and how much of the economy should be private and how much should be public.","The man who runs the city government in Ho Chi Minh City was quite proud of the fact that they had done a remarkable job of creating jobs in the private sector, that he had downsized the government, that poverty had been reduced by 70 percent, and homelessness was reduced by 70 percent. So I think there are a lot of people there who have this feeling that if they go more to a private economy and they have more entrepreneurial spirit, that there will also be more personal freedom associated with it.","First Lady's Discussion of Human Rights","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. I understand that the First Lady also had some strong words to recommend human rights at her talk in the morning of Sunday.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. She met with a group of women there. It was something she tries to do in every country in the world she visits. She's been speaking about that, especially as human rights affect women and young girls, ever since she went to the Beijing Women's Conference several years ago.","U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement","[INTERVIEWER]. That's wonderful. Now, what is your reading of the progress so far made about the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreements? Did you get any indication while you were there as to when the Vietnamese National Assembly might get to ratify that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think they will ratify it pretty soon. I thinkI had the feeling they want to make absolutely sure that we're going to ratify it. And they understand that the timing is not good for ratification now, but I think as soon as we ratify it, they will. And then I think that we told them that we would be spending a couple million dollars a year over the next 3 years to help ensure the rapid and thorough implementation of the agreement. And we told them that we would like to have a high-level meeting, at least annually, to plot a joint economic strategy for the future, and they agreed to that. So my instinct is that they do want to get the maximum benefits out of this trade agreement.","[INTERVIEWER]. But then, what would be your impression as to when the U.S. Congress might ratify that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think they will do it as soon as they have a chance, probably early next year. You know, I wish I could do it now, but I just don't know if it's practical. So I think that I don't think there is any shot that it won't be approved by the Congress. There is just too much support for it.","Press Secretary Jake Siewert. Last question, please.","Discussions With Vietnamese Leaders","[INTERVIEWER]. [Inaudible]being very diplomatic in handling the question of human rights, religious, and other democratic freedoms in Vietnam. But Hanoi's sensitivity to this question is all too obvious. Did you make any headway in your talk with Secretary General Le Kha Phieu or Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on this front, or do you think the U.S. could work with Vietnam on this matter in a more open fashion?","[INTERVIEWED]. I had very open conversations with all of them, with the Prime Minister, with the Secretary General and [INTERVIEWED]. And what I believe is that once they realize that we're not trying to tell Vietnam how to run every aspect of their lives and that we feel that we're going to be in a friendly relation, we have to be honest about our disagreements, and we have to say what we think human rights and religious rights and individual freedom have meant to our country.","I think we will be in a dialog there, and I think that, plus the process of economic and social change which is going on in Vietnam will lead the country in a positive direction. That's what I believe. I think it will be very important for my successor to continue that dialog. I don't think we can drop human rights or religious freedom from our concerns anywhere in the world.","[INTERVIEWER]. Can we ask you just one last quick question","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","Musicians in Vietnam","[INTERVIEWER]. Did you have a chance to play your saxophone while you were there?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. But I love the music. I didhowever, I heard a Vietnamese saxophone player at the entertainment after the state dinner, and he was really, really good. All the musicians were great. I was very impressed by the musical performances that were done after the state dinner.","[INTERVIEWER]. You wouldn't allow us maybe just","Press Secretary Siewert. No, I think we have to wrap up. Sorry.","[INTERVIEWED]. We're in Alaska, and we have to get back on the plane to go home. I'm sorry. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]","[INTERVIEWED].  Goodbye."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithniletvegypt","text":[" ","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for talking to Egyptian television. [INTERVIEWED], you're coming to Egypt next week, and you are meeting with [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak and a number of other Arab leaders. What are you going to tell them? What role do you see the Arab countries playing in the coming stage?","[INTERVIEWED]. First, I want to thank [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak for his hospitality. He has been telling me about the beauty of Sharm el-Sheikh for a long time, and now I'm going to get to see it firsthand.","[INTERVIEWER]. You will love it.","[INTERVIEWED]. I am looking forward to it.","The first thing I want to do is to make it very clear to the leaders in the neighborhood that I am intent upon working toward a two-state solution in the Middle East two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. In other words, I want them to look me in the eye so they can see that I am determined to work to make this happen.","I'm also going to remind them the United States cannot do this alone. We obviously need Israeli support. We obviously need the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority's work and help. And we need countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Jordan and others to work together to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to prevent the killers from moving around, to help provide security, and as a Palestinian state emerges, to support Prime Minister Abbas' regime with not only advice but, when necessary, development aid so an economy can start to grow in a Palestinian state.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Commitment to Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], let me follow up on that. You said you are determined to bring peace, you are committed, personally committed to the roadmap, and you are personally involved in the roadmap. That has sort of a different approach from the approach that the administration had adopted at the beginning, which was a hands-off approach, the peace process.","The question is, how long would that commitment and involvement, personal involvement, last and how deep is it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I think it's not a fair characterization to say we were hands-offquite the contrary. I took an assessment of what was possible and realized that it was impossible to achieve peace with Chairman Arafat. He's failed the Palestinian people in the past. My predecessor tried hard, and I watched very carefully what was tried at Camp David.","Now, having said that, I also was working with the parties to try to set the conditions necessary for the emergence of a Palestinian government with whom we could work, so we wouldn't waste time, so that actually some progress could be made.","So the people have got to know when I say something, I mean it. Hopefully by now people have learned that, that when George W. commits America to a project, we mean that, we don't have idle chit-chat, that we're serious about our intentions.","[INTERVIEWER]. So the Arabs, or the people in the region shouldn't really be worrying about voices within your administration who are opposed to serious efforts by the United States","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, they don't have to worry about that, because I'm going to put the effort forward.","[INTERVIEWER]. So you don't listen to them?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it sounds like they don't listen to me, because when I say something, I mean it. And I think [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak knows that. And I'm going to refresh their memories about the kind of administration I try to run. When I say something, we actually go do it. And when I say that I'm going to be involved in the peace process, I mean I'm going to be involved in the peace process.","Now, I understand it's going to be tough and difficult, but I believe it can happen. And I want to work toward achieving two states, so that the Palestinian suffering and humiliation ends.","[INTERVIEWER]. And [INTERVIEWED], how do you see the future of the Egyptian-American relations, the strategical relations that binded those two countries over the past two decades?","[INTERVIEWED]. Strong, I think, a good future. Listen, we have counted on Egypt, and Egypt counts on America. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. Throughout my Government, people deal with the Egyptian authorities, and I think it's in our interests, our national interest to keep a strong relationship with Egypt, and I intend to do so.","[INTERVIEWER]. Right. We are looking forward to seeing you, [INTERVIEWED], in Sharm el-Sheikh. Thank you very much for your time.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's going to be an exciting trip, and I look forward to the hospitality of the Egyptian people. And I want to assure the people of Egypt that the relationship is an important relationship between Egypt and the United States. And I want to assure your listeners that when I come to the region, I come with peace in mind and the possibilities of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis is real in my mind, and I'm going to work toward that objective."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithninatotenbergnationalpublicradio","text":["About Search"," ","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]. , Judge Garland was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, I think Merrick Garland is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation. And it is a testimony to how good he is that, you know, he has cropped up as a potential Supreme Court justice for a very long time.","I have always been a huge admirer of his. I've always felt that the way he approaches cases the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building were qualities that would make him an outstanding Supreme Court justice.","This moment in our history a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.","And so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring or at least increasing the American people's confidence in our justice system.","[INTERVIEWER]. Did you talk to him about being \"a piñata,\" as Sen. Cornyn put it?","[INTERVIEWED]. . We had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, so I assume that he either reads The Washington Post or listens to NPR, and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader McConnell took immediately after Justice Scalia's passing the notion that the Republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.","I'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates not just for Supreme Court, but for appellate court judges.","[INTERVIEWER]. But he's not he's not a pol.","[INTERVIEWED]. . No, he isn't. And so we discussed that, and I wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're we call folks like Judge Garland \"civilians.\" And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.","But, you know, I think the way he described it and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.","And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.","And I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.","[INTERVIEWER]. By the way, when did you offer him the job?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Over the weekend.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, he's a very good actor because I had dinner with him Sunday night [at a small charity event], and he looked like he kept just was saying he wasn't going to get it.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, you know, I I that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting being nominated for the Supreme Court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.","[INTERVIEWER]. But you just told me they were hatched.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, I'm not sure about that.","[INTERVIEWER]. In the heat of ...","[INTERVIEWED]. . I might have called him right after dinner.","[INTERVIEWER]. In the heat of a [INTERVIEWED]. ial campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of Republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? They clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. But but how do you keep it up there? When the Supreme Court, frankly I've written more pieces in my life saying, \"This year it may be an issue,\" and then it never really is.","[INTERVIEWED]. . This year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been [INTERVIEWED]. ial campaign season so far.","I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in [INTERVIEWED]. ial race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic \"no\" to everything.","And when you then have add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, \"I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote,\" and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.","And so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and [INTERVIEWED]. s whether they're Democrats or Republicans are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.","At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.","And so I we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.","There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming degenerating into just a pure political battle.","[INTERVIEWER]. So we've reported that Republican leading Republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: \"OK, if you appoint Merrick Garland, we we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a Democratic [INTERVIEWED]. .\" Did that play any role in your decision?","[INTERVIEWED]. . I have not had conversations like that.","[INTERVIEWER]. No, I didn't say you had.","[INTERVIEWED]. . What I have seen are the public statements of leading Republicans like Orrin Hatch broadly complimenting Judge Garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.","And ...","[INTERVIEWER]. So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number one, I think he's the best person for the job. Number two, I think he's a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment.","Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.","It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. I said I would play it straight that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job. And Merrick Garland fits that bill.","[INTERVIEWER]. Your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except Merrick Garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. You picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. He's not, you know, he's not going to this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.","What do you say to that those folks?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been [INTERVIEWED]. of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any [INTERVIEWED]. ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other [INTERVIEWED]. ; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any [INTERVIEWED]. in history.","We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.","When it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.","And I have confidence that without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.","[INTERVIEWER]. What do you ask these folks in your interviews? I mean, you can't say, \"So, what do you think of Roe v. Wade?\" That would be improper, right?","[INTERVIEWED]. . I do not do that.","[INTERVIEWER]. So, I'm Judge [INTERVIEWER]. I'm here for my interview. What are you going to ask me? What kinds of things do you ask?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.","And when you hear Judge Garland's background when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.","With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.","One thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.","But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.","[INTERVIEWER]. Let me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Sure.","[INTERVIEWER]. You've said that neither party comes to this process clean.","[INTERVIEWED]. . It's absolutely true.","[INTERVIEWER]. And you voted to not end debate on the Alito nomination. And if I understood you correctly at your press conference, what I thought I heard you say was, \"You know, I knew that it was a meaningless vote.\" You got a pass from the leadership. You can do this.","But can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, \"There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court.\" So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win [INTERVIEWED]. ial nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the Democrats do the same? They called they're all already calling it the \"Biden rule.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from Joe Biden when he was on the Judiciary Committee if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically.","[INTERVIEWER]. Oh, Jesus. Oops.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Should we start that one over?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yeah, let's do that.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Wow, Nina. You're supposed to turn off your phone.","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm not I'm supposed to be a pro.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Come on.","[INTERVIEWER]. Come on.","[INTERVIEWED]. . The, uh ...","[INTERVIEWER]. It's the office.","[INTERVIEWED]. . I'm assuming you can just splice the question and I'll just answer it, so Nina doesn't have to answer ask it again.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yeah.","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a [INTERVIEWED]. in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.","Well, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a [INTERVIEWED]. in my circumstances should do.","Number two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.","This is just raw politics. \"We don't want somebody who's been nominated by a Democrat\" a claim that I would have never made at the time.","Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.","Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic [INTERVIEWED]. is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, \"We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic [INTERVIEWED]. 's nominee\"?","And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican [INTERVIEWED]. was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.","Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of [INTERVIEWED]. Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of [INTERVIEWED]. , requires them to do their job.","And my simple pitch to them is, be fair not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.","A good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you taking this on the road?","[INTERVIEWED]. . Well, you know, I'm going to make the case I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.","Well in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me [INTERVIEWED].  with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, \"We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break.\" They said, \"No, you're [INTERVIEWED]. for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.\"","So the American people already have decided. They've already weighed in. They will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next [INTERVIEWED]. will fill that vacancy.","The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.","But one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as [INTERVIEWED], I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.","And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]. , thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.","[INTERVIEWED]. . I enjoyed it, Nina. Thank you."," "]}

The bonds of friendship between Japan and the United States are among the strongest in the world. As [INTERVIEWED]. of the United States, do you have any special message for the Japanese people? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, yes, I do. Number one, we're looking forward very much to our trip, which will begin tomorrow. And this will be the third time that we have had the opportunity of visiting Japan, so we are looking forward to this return.","But I think the message that. I would have is that the close friendship that we do have ans the relationship, overall, imposes have and the relationship on Japan and the United States a responsibility to the world to foster peace and prosperity. Between us, Japan and the United States are responsible for one-third of all the gross national product of the world. We are the two greatest trading partners our relationship between each other that way. But we can make such a contribution to easing the tensions in the world and bringing the prosperity and the peace that I think the people of all the world want. Some governments may not want that, but the people want it. And between us, as I say, we have a great duty.","[INTERVIEWER]. You are now having the most difficult and egregious time as [INTERVIEWED]. . What are the real, major objectives of your trip to Japan?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that we have a number of things that we need to talk about, because we are such close friends and allies. I think, for one thing, we have some differences with regard to trade. And as we discussed when Prime Minister Nakasane was here for the Williamsburg summit, we discussed the need for all the world to get away from the idea of protectionism in trade, trying to maintain an advantage over someone else.","The great growth and prosperity of Japan in trade and industry is due to the idea of democracy and free trade. And so free trade must also be fair trade. And I am concerned that here in our own country some of the restraints on our exports to your country have led some to a feeling of protectionism and that they must do something in retaliation. I feel that as we loosen the restraints between us in trade, that is the answer to those who could give us political problems in both our countries to the Prime Minister, to myself, here. So, we will be discussing all those ways in which we can restore that trade.","We have between us the biggest trade between any two countries in the world. And there is a dangerous imbalance now in that trade. So, those will be some of the things that I hope to be discussing.","[INTERVIEWER]. While some Japanese feel our country should be unarmed and neutral, Prime Minister Nakasone considers cooperation between Japan and the United States absolutely necessary to Asian peace and security. I would appreciate your comment on this.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I agree with Prime Minister Nakasone very much. The Pacific Basin is the area of the future, and Japan I recognize you have some constitutional problems with this but a strong Japan, a Japan able to manage more of its own defense, will be a great factor for stability in that whole area. And while we're talking peace, there are some who seem to suggest that if you're talking military strength, you're talking against peace. Well, I don't know of anyone that ever got into a war because they were too strong.","What we need is to be able to deter others who are destabilizing the forces, such as from the Soviet Union with their attempts at expansionism. What we need is to have the military strength to deter aggression at the same time that we try to convince the aggressors that they, too, will be better off in a peaceful world.","So yes, we appreciate very much what Japan has done in increasing their own defense. I know that a goal, and one I hope they'll achieve soon, is to be able to protect for 1,000 miles around your trade lines and your supply lines. And we want to continue the relationship we have in that regard.","[INTERVIEWER]. Trade friction between Japan and the United States is serious. Do you sometimes worry that it may influence bilateral relations between our two countries?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm afraid I almost answered that question in advance to your earlier question there. Yes, those restrictions which I mentioned a moment ago. We must find where, fairly, we can reconcile the differences between our currencies. We must remove restrictions that impair trade back and forth, and we must just as we're friends and allies in everything else we must have that same kind of approach to our trade with each other, our opening of our capital markets to each other for investment.","[INTERVIEWER]. American relations with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union influence our own relations with them. Could you discuss current American policy toward these two countries?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, with regard to the Republic of China, we are working very hard to establish a stronger relationship, one that has always in the past characterized the relationship between our country and China. I think we've been making great progress. Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang will be visiting here this winter, and next spring I expect to visit the People's Republic of China myself.","With the Soviet Union, we have to recognize there that there is where we must have the strength to deter aggression. They seem bent on worldwide expansionism. They have 50 divisions on the Chinese border. They have about 120 SS-20 nuclear missiles on that border. They have the largest fleet, the largest of their fleets is in the Pacific, in the area of both Japan and the People's Republic of China. So, there we must have the patience to convince them that peace would be to their advantage, also. And in the meantime, the only way to protect the peace is to have the strength to deter.","But we are very pleased with the progress we've made with the People's Republic of China in establishing friendship there.","[INTERVIEWER]. You and I happen to be the same age. I, too, was born in 1911. You and I also share a deep commitment to democracy and freedom, and we long for peace around the world. It seems, however, that the forces of violence and hate are growing. What are the prospects for peace in the world, despite recent tragedies in Beirut, Rangoon, and KAL 007?","[INTERVIEWED]. Those tragic events recently, the terrorist acts, what has happened to our men in Beirut, are all evidences of how necessary it is for those of us who can, for countries like Japan and the United States, to erase the causes of such hatred and to work ceaselessly for peace.","Yes, you and I were born in the same year. I like to think it was a good vintage year. But we've had an opportunity to see war and peace throughout these years, to see how foolishly sometimes war came upon us, and at the same time to see the spread of democracy and what it has brought. When you look at your own country, when you look at South Korea, when you look at Hang Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and see where the principles of free commerce and trade, the principles of democracy are at work, how much better off they are than those countries that have followed the totalitarian path of communism and statism.","So, I think that while things can look dark and threatening, I think the very fact that there is awareness now on the part of many of us who have seen the other, that yes, we can bring peace. We can prove the need for it. And I think there's more awareness in the world today that in order to have peace we must have strength. So, I am not discouraged by what is going on.","[INTERVIEWER]. Many people, both here and in the rest of the world, now refer to Japan as an economic superpower. Within the overall context of U.S.-Japan relations, what are your principal expectations for this new, more powerful Japan?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well and I think this is a classic example for the world there is one superpower in the world today that is recognized as such simply because of its military strength and not because of any achievements that it has made in commerce and industry or the living standard of its people. In fact, to maintain their military strength, that power has denied the comforts of living to its people.","On the other hand, you are the second industrial and commercial power in the world. So in that sense you have become a superpower in the peaceful pursuits of commerce and trade and good living for your people. And that is well deserved. That's why we are allies. [INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for the opportunity. [INTERVIEWER]. Have a nice trip to Japan.","[INTERVIEWED]. We are looking forward to it. Thank you. [INTERVIEWER]. See you in Tokyo.","[INTERVIEWED]. I look forward to it. Thank you very much."]}

Are you worried about your legacy in some ways, that there might be an establishment of a terrorist safe haven in the middle of the Middle East?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, first of all, I think we did exactly what we should have done, which is to turn over to Iraq a country that had the capacity, the ability to govern itself if all the parties involved Shia, Sunni and Kurd were prepared to make compromises with each other.","And I think the American people understood that whatever the debate about originally going in, our troops made enormous sacrifices to give the Iraqi people that chance. Unfortunately, that trust between those parties has never fully cohered. And now we're seeing some of the consequences of that.","[INTERVIEWER] : I mean, ISIS is a group that is so extreme","[INTERVIEWED]: Mmm hmm. [acknowledging]","[INTERVIEWER] : it has been disavowed by al-Qaida as being too violent.","[INTERVIEWED]: Right.","[INTERVIEWER] : How urgent of a threat to the American people is ISIS?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it's fair to say that their extreme ideology poses a medium- and long-term threat. Right now the problem with ISIS is the fact that they are destabilizing a country that could spill over into some of our, you know, allies, like Jordan, and that they are engaged in wars in Syria where, in that vacuum that's been created, they could amass more arms, more resources.","[INTERVIEWER] : Would that vacuum exist had we backed the moderate rebel forces in Syria?","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes. I think this notion that somehow there was this ready-made moderate Syrian force that was able to defeat Assad is simply not true. The notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn, you know, not only Assad, but also ruthless, highly trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms, is a fantasy.","[break]","[INTERVIEWER] : This is the first ever White House summit on working families. I know you said in your State of the Union, when women succeed, America succeeds. What's the single most important thing you think you can do to help working women?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, the question is not just what I can do, but I think what we as a society need to do. And this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart. I was raised by a single mom. Probably the most important financial bedrock of our family was my grandmother. And both of them were strong, hard-working women, but they experienced the glass ceiling. They dealt with child-care crises.","I'm now married to a pretty strong woman in Michelle Obama. And before we got to this place, she was dealing sometimes with me campaigning or being away and her having to deal with two small children while also working. And now I've got two daughters. So I want to make sure that they're able to balance family life and the workplace much better than or at least their choices will be better than some of the choices that existed before.","So the idea of this working summit is to really lift up conversations that every family all across America has every day. The workplace will be more productive and people will do better if, in fact, they've got a little more flexibility than they currently have.","[INTERVIEWER] : I mean, you look at, even as your you know, your oldest daughter does an internship do you look and say, wow, much hasn't changed, and this is kind of a problem, and I don't want my daughter to have to go through this?","[INTERVIEWED]: It's important for us not to deny the progress that's been made. You know, women occupy positions of authority and are able to take advantage of career opportunities that, a generation ago, might have been blocked. What's also true is that, you know, all too often childrearing burdens fall on them. They've got to juggle more stuff. What's also true is that, across the board in the aggregate, women are making 77 cents for every dollar that a man's making. Discrimination's still taking place.","And so part of what we want to do is to lift up the possibilities of changes in federal policy. But we don't want to restrict it to just federal laws. We also want to show that companies on their own initiative will discover that it's good business sense for them to take advantage of or to offer workers more flexibility on the job.","[INTERVIEWER] : Why is it, then I mean, the majority of the American people back paid family leave that you can't get it through Congress?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, we're  we're unique among developed countries in not offering it. We've got, unfortunately, a faction of one party that says no to everything. And maybe the summit can highlight that this is not a partisan issue. This is a middle- class issue. This is an American issue."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnovayagazeta","text":["1. Do you agree with the opinion expressed by many Russian and European politicians that the United States is primarily responsible for the economic difficulties that their countries are now living through?","No. We all are experiencing a severe economic crisis that is affecting the lives of many people in countries around the world. This crisis resulted from a culture of irresponsibility regarding financial matters that took hold over a number of years in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. I am proud of our efforts to lead by reforming our regulatory and supervisory systems and promoting an era of responsibility, so that the U.S. and global economies will be stable and growth will be sustained. We of course have an obvious interest in developing policies that stimulate economic growth in the United States, but we also believe that economic growth in our country also will nurture economic growth around the world, including in Russia.","In the 21st century, we all -Americans, Russians, and everyone else - have an interest in fostering world economic growth that benefits us all. We need to spend less time thinking about who is to blame and more time working together to do what needs to be done to get all of our economies moving in the right direction.","2. Do you agree that lies and greed - - lies about the state of markets and greed of their participants are the main reasons for the current economic crisis?","As I said to Congress in February, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. Nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before.","In other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn’t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.","3. Many experts believe that the 21st Century Financial Regulatory Reform you proposed may become the most significant innovation in the U.S. financial system since the era of [INTERVIEWED] Franklin D. Roosevelt. What do you consider to be the most important element of this reform? Are we at the doorstep of new transparency of business and finances?","Our regulatory and supervisory reform plans, announced a few weeks ago, are sweeping and important. The plans include three important components. First, we're proposing a set of reforms to require regulators to look not only at the safety and soundness of individual institutions, but also for the first time at the stability of the financial system as a whole. Second, we're proposing a new and powerful agency charged with just one job: looking out for ordinary consumers. Third, we're proposing a series of changes designed to promote free and fair markets by closing gaps and overlaps in our regulatory system including gaps that exist not just within but between nations. We are called upon to put in place those reforms that allow our best qualities to flourish while keeping those worst traits in check. We're called upon to recognize that the free market is the most powerful generative force for our prosperity but it is not a free license to ignore the consequences of our actions.","4. On November 18, 2005 Senators [INTERVIEWED], Biden and McCain together with other Senators adopted Resolution 232 on the trial, sentence and imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy and Platon Lebedev. The Resolution said that \"in investigations that present a threat to authorities, Russian courts become instruments of the Kremlin, and cannot be responsible or independent.\" Have you been following the new trial of Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev?","I do not know the intimate details of these new proceedings, though my advisors most certainly do. However, without knowing the details, it does seem odd to me that these new charges, which appear to be a repackaging of the old charges, should be surfacing now, years after these two individuals have been in prison and as they become eligible for parole. Nonetheless, I think it is improper for outsiders to interfere in the legal processes of Russia. Instead, I would just affirm my support for [INTERVIEWED] Medvedev’s courageous initiative to strengthen the rule of law in Russia, which of course includes making sure that all those accused of crimes have the right to a fair trial and that the courts are not used for political purposes.","5. \"Restarting\" the relationship implies cooperating with Russia in those areas where it is possible. Does this mean weaker attention to Russia’s observation of civil rights and liberties, and to persecution against and murders of journalists? Specifically, to [the need to] apprehend and punish those who ordered and committed the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya?","Of course not. I seek to reset relations with Russia because I believe that Americans and Russians have many common interests, interests that our governments recently have not pursued as actively as we could have. For instance, I believe that Americans and Russians both would benefit from fewer nuclear weapons in the world, greater control over nuclear materials around the world, a defeat of extremist elements in Afghanistan and Pakistan, an Iran that produces nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons, and a North Korea that refrains from launching missiles and exploding nuclear weapons and instead returns to the negotiating table. I also believe that Americans and Russians have a common interest in the development of rule of rule, the strengthening of democracy, and the protection of human rights. As I said in my inaugural address: \"To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\" I then emphasized in my Cairo speech that \"I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. These are not just American ideas; they are human rights.\" These are ideas embraced by your [INTERVIEWED] and your people. I agree with [INTERVIEWED] Medvedev when he said that \"Freedom is better than the absence of freedom.\" So, I see no reason why we cannot aspire together to strengthen democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as part of our \"reset.\"","6. Will you sign the new START treaty if Russia conditions its signing upon non-deployment of the U.S. missile defense system in Central Europe?","In our meeting in London on April 1st, [INTERVIEWED] Medvedev and I issued a joint statement on instructions for our negotiators for this new treaty. These instructions very explicitly did not mention missile defense as a topic of discussion for these negotiations.","At the same time, we understand Russian sensitivities to this issue and have sent several high-level delegations to Moscow over the last several weeks to engage in a serious dialogue about U.S.-Russian cooperation on missile defense.","My government is completing a comprehensive review of all of our missile defense programs, including those in Europe. Given the threats around the world, especially those growing from North Korea and Iran, our goal is to enhance missile defense for the United States and our allies in Europe and elsewhere. As I have said many times, such a system has to work, be cost effective, and must address the real threats to the United States and our allies, not imaginary ones. When discussing our plans for Europe, we first and foremost are seeking to build a missile defense system that protects the United States and Europe from an Iranian ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead. We are not building and will not build a system that is aimed to respond to an attack from Russia. Such thinking is simply a legacy of the Cold War.","We have not yet decided how we will configure missile defense in Europe. But my sincere hope is that Russia will be a partner in that project. If we combine our assets on missile defense, the United States, Russia, and our allies will be much safer than if we go it alone. I see a great potential here, and I hope to have a robust discussion with [INTERVIEWED] Medvedev about these possibilities for cooperation on missile defense when I am in Moscow next week.","7. In the course of your [INTERVIEWED]ial campaign, you competed with Hillary Clinton. Does this hinder your joint work now?","Absolutely not. This is the beauty of democracy. Secretary Clinton and I engaged in a hard-fought, very competitive race for the nomination of our party. By the way, without question, these primaries made me a better candidate for the general election against Senator John McCain. But in democracies, once the election is over, then all Americans who care about our country get back to work. It was because of how well I got to know Secretary Clinton during our campaign that I knew she would be such an excellent Secretary of State, and she has served our country with excellence."]}

Good morning, [INTERVIEWED]. , although it's good evening for Russian audience because of the time change. Your father is a World War II hero, the youngest Navy pilot. So how important the D-day is for you, personally, and for your family?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you for asking about my dad. He is he was alike many in America and in Russia that were called upon to defend the world against nazism. And fortunately, he came home.","And today, the celebration in Russia will remind us all about the sacrifices of, in my case, an individual I love, but also a generation, a generation of men and women who made extraordinary efforts, inRussia's case to defend the homeland, in America's case to work with allies to defeat Adolf Hitler as well as the Japanese.","And so it's a special day for me, personally, because it reminds me of the willingness of a young kid to go fight. But it also reminds me of the duty of my generation to work together to make the world a better place.","[INTERVIEWER1]. The after-war Europe has been reshaped according to the Yalta Conference of 1943, by the decision of three very important personalities of this time, Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Stalin. How fair is it to hold only Russia responsible for all the misfortunes of Eastern Europe and Baltic States over the last?","[INTERVIEWED]. Now, that's a very fair question. Obviously, it was a decision made at the end of the war. I think that the main complaint would be that the form of government that the Baltics had to live under was not of their choosing. But no, there's no question three leaders made the decision.","[INTERVIEWER1]. So not only Russia the bad guy of history?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think everybody ought to bear theas historians look back at Yaltagot to recognize that it was you're rightly so in pointing it outit was not only the Russian leader but the British and American leader were at the table and agreed on the agreement.","[INTERVIEWER1]. In Russia, we're very concerned on the rise of neo-nazism in Baltic States when Russian war veterans are humiliated publicly, when monuments to Russian soldiers are vandalized, and at the same time, where, on May 8th, there is a plan to open the monument to Nazi Brigade, that is well known only for fightingnot only for fighting against Russians but also for quite ugly things that were common for SS troops.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Well, look, there is I've got a message when I go to the Baltics, and that is it's important to respect democracy but, also, the respect of democracy is respect for minority rights. In other words, a true democracy is one that says minorities are important and that the will of the majority can't trample the minority.","And as to whether or not nations are honoring nazism, I mean, of course that should be rejected. Nazism was defeated. We're celebrating the defeat of nazism. We don't want to see nazism return. It's an extremist point of view that believes that you should be able to trample the rights of minorities. It was the Nazis who annihilated millions of Jews, for example, and there's a classic example of the rights of minorities being trampled. And we must never forget the lessons of why we fought together in World War II. And so I'm looking forward to delivering that message of tolerance.","[INTERVIEWER1]. There is a question that has nothing to do with your visit to Russia but is very important to our country as an oil-producing country. Once you mentioned that you'll be happy to find a magic wand and to cut the price on oil. So what oil price will be acceptable for the United States, and what do you think is the chance of finding this magic wand?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I appreciateno, there is no magic wand. A soldier asked me, he said, \"Why don't you lower gasoline prices,\" as if the government controlled price. And in our country, the Government doesn't control price. And I told him, I said, \"If I had a magic wand, I would wave it and lower your price.\" But Ithat's not the way it works. This is a world based the price based upon supply and demand. And demand has been going up relative to supply, which has been beneficial for oil-producing countries like Russia.","And I don't know what the right price is. Obviously, the lower the better for our economy, because every time the money the dollars go up on the gasoline price, money leaves the pocketbooks of the working people. But that's the way the economy works. Hopefully, higher price will stimulate more production. More production will then help the price reach an equilibrium.","And the market is what it is. That's the markets decide, not governments. I would hope that Russia would encourage a lot of investment, to open up the vast reserves she has. We need to do more exploration here. I spoke to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who assured me that he is trying to put moreto find more oil. And that's what high prices do. But people who have got oil have got to understand if the price gets too high, it could wreck economies, which will mean there's less purchasing power for the product.","[INTERVIEWER1].

And so I'm looking forward to the trip. The Prime Minister was here several weeks ago. We had a very good talk. And he was laying the groundwork for what I think will be a constructive visit. Be glad to answer some questions.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], I'll start with the cartoon controversy. You and your allies work very hard on bridging the gap between the Islamic and the Western world, but the publication of a few cartoons in a remote newspaper seems to have undone everything. Why?","[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I think it's very important for people around the world to know that a free press is important for a democratic state; a free press for peaceful states as well. Free press holds people to account. Free press makes sure that there is a check and a balance on people in power. Free press also must be a responsible press.","Secondly, I fully understand people taking not liking the cartoons. On the other hand, I do not believe that people should use that as a pretext for violence, nor do I appreciate the fact that some are using  manipulating the anger over the cartoons to achieve political ends. And therefore, it's very important for governments to not allow policy to be set by those who are cynically manipulating the anger that some have felt over these cartoons.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], you have announced this global nuclear energy initiative, and this is the one that you have offered to India also. And you have spoken about the countries countries like India can also get a benefit of this initiative. Do you have Pakistan in mind Pakistan already saying that this offer to India is India-specific? Is it India-specific, or Pakistan can also be included in this initiative?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we are starting with India, and one of the primary reasons why is that India is in need of a diversification away from fossil fuels. India is consuming a lot of fossil fuel. That is driving up the price of a part of the reasons why the price is rising. America uses a lot of fossil fuels. China is using more fossil fuels. India is using more fossil fuels, and it's affecting the price of energy in the United States and in India and in Pakistan. And so therefore, to the extent to which we can get these fast-growing, developing nations to use something other than fossil fuels, it's in the world's interest, and it's in Pakistan's interest as well.","Now and so I would not view some say, \"Well, this is a zero-sum attitude by the United States,\" quite the contrary. It's the beginning of a policy that says, there will be a suppliers group of people who are capable of providing fuel stocks for a civilian nuclear power industry, countries that will then collect the spent fuel, reprocess it to be able to burn it in new types of reactors.","The purpose of this whole initiative, and beginning with countries like India, is to recognize that alternative sources of energy are going to be important for the development of a clean world and a world that becomes substantially less reliant on nonrenewable sources of energy.","[INTERVIEWER] But Pakistan can't be included in that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I said, this is just the beginning of a very long process.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], in your speech, you talked about Kashmir dispute, and you said that you would like India and Pakistan to take bilateral steps to resolve the dispute. Pakistan has made certain proposals, but they are not reciprocated by India. And it seems that this bilateral is not going anywhere; there's need for a third-party mediation or some sort of help. Do you have any specific proposals for that?","[INTERVIEWED]. First, I'd like to make sure I clarify my statement for all to read. America supports a solution that is acceptable to all sides since you're probably the only person in the room that paid attention to my speech the speech, as you know, I said, \"to both sides.\" The language should be \"all sides,\" because it recognizes that a solution must be acceptable to India, Pakistan, and those living within Kashmir.","Our position is one that says a dispute that has been so long in a nation's history can best be resolved when two nations make the determination to sit down and come up with a solution that is acceptable to all sides. Of course, during my discussions, I will encourage that dialog to go forward. I'm convinced that history changes, and as history changes, attitudes can change, circumstances change, and that we have a possibility to see this issue resolved by strong and courageous leaders.","I'm pleased to see the amount of trade that's taking place between India and Pakistan. It's a substantial increase from July of '04 to July of '05. I thought that the the new transportation routes between India and Pakistan are hopeful signs.","And so the role of the United States, in our judgment, is one that will help lead to a settlement that is acceptable to all sides.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], you also spoke about democracy in Pakistan; some distance has to be covered. And the Commonwealth has recently asked Mr. Musharraf [INTERVIEWED] Musharraf that he must decide by 2007 whether he wants to continue as the Chief of Army Staff or as the [INTERVIEWED], one decision. Is the United States comfortable with a leader who is also the Chief of Army Staff in a democracy? Does it bother you that he his contribution as the Chief of Army Staff?","[INTERVIEWED]. I've had discussions with the [INTERVIEWED] quite frequently about his vision for a democratic Pakistan. And I am I believe that he is headed for a continue to head for on the road of reform. And he understands the pressures being put on him. As you said, the Commonwealth spoke, and I believe that he's committed to having a reform process come to fruition, and I believe he's committed to free and open elections.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], there is another issue that is particularly sensitive for both India and Pakistan, which is that Iran India-Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline. As we said, India need alternative sources of energy. So is it possible that decision, allow the construction of the pipeline?","[INTERVIEWED]. What's important is that India, Pakistan, and the United States work together to send a firm message to the Iranians that a development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. You know, we energy supplies are important for India, and they're important for Pakistan. I fully understand that. But a country which has been unwilling to adhere to treaties that it's agreed to, a country the [INTERVIEWED] of which has said the destruction of Israel is in part of foreign policy, a country which has not told the truth when it comes to whether or not they're enriching uranium or not, is a country that free nations need to deal with in a diplomatic way. And the best thing that the Iranians can hear is a unified message from all of us.","[INTERVIEWER] Does it mean that at some date you could decide to take military action against Iran? Would you","[INTERVIEWED]. Diplomacy is our first option.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], the recent incident in which U.S. military made a strike in the Pakistani tribal area in the Bajaur area. This has happened before also, and there was some outrage in Pakistan that there was no remorse from the U.S. Government on the action. These actions, when they are taken, is it because the unilateral action that the folks on the other side do not trust their colleagues on the side of the border, or it's the timing, is it intelligence, or the lack of operational capabilities on the side on the Pakistani side, that such actions are taken?","[INTERVIEWED]. We are we're partners in the war against terrorists, some of whom tried to kill your [INTERVIEWED]. We coordinate. We're allies, and we coordinate nor do we talk about sensitive antiterror operations. Of course, the United States mourns the loss of innocent life.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], in your speech, you also you spoke about importance of prosperity, and you talked about offering business industry in Pakistan. Do you have anything specific in mind, such as Pakistan has been trying for some time to get an FTA?","[INTERVIEWED]. First step is a BIT, and we will discuss that we will continue to discuss that. We discussed that during the Prime Minister's trip, and we will continue to pursue this avenue toward opening up additional opportunities, commercial opportunities between our respective countries.","First things first, however there have been some preliminary discussions, as well, about perhaps some trading arrangements in the Western Provinces of Pakistan. These are preliminary discussions. We think it makes sense to have a discussion. Such an agreement, if a commercial arrangement, investment arrangement would be beneficial not only to Pakistan but to Afghanistan as well. And so there's a variety of discussions we're having to continue to open up ways to encourage investment and commerce.","I must I applaud the [INTERVIEWED]'s economic reform package. It's yielded some strong results. Pakistan's economy is growing, and that's positive. You know, one of the key things is that people see the benefits of democracy the tangible benefits of democracy, besides being able to express themselves. Today I also referred to the Pakistan press, you might recall. I think I referred to you as lively, meaning that at least the Pakistan press I've been exposed to has never been afraid to ask any questions, or never been intimidated, particularly with the open press conference. And I suspect it might be the same when I go next week.","So I want to talk about reconstruction aid right quick before you finish. It's very important for the people of Pakistan to and this is where trade matters as well, and commerce matters as well, that they see that the United States is interested in the lives of the citizens. You know, sometimes in the way things get reported, our policies get disconnected from people's lives improving. And we want that to happen, because a prosperous Pakistan is will be a great example, a country that believes in markets and educating people to fill the jobs of the 21st century, and a country that continues to deal with rules and regulations that make investment difficult at times, will show what's possible. And that's important.","When the disaster struck, it took our Government no time to move. And we moved a lot of equipment and a lot of manpower and a lot of aid, because we cared about the people that were suffering. I remember [INTERVIEWED] Musharraf calling me on the phone at one point to thank me. And it was a genuine thanks, because we were as you know, we transferred a lot choppers, which were necessary to be able to move manpower and aid into remote regions of your country.","He also asked, would we make sure that beyond the recovery effort, that there was a commitment to help rebuild. And my answer was, yes. And the reason it's important for your readers to understand, I said, yes, because this country cares about the families whose lives were turned upside down by this disaster. When we heard 73,000 people lost their life, it touched our hearts and our conscience. When we realized over 2 million people lost their homes, we cared about those who had been displaced.","And so our commitment is to the people of Pakistan, and it's a genuine, real, tangible commitment that the people of the country can see. I understand there's politics, and there's there's people expressing their opinions. But one thing they can't argue with those who want to be critical of the United States can't argue with a genuine, heartfelt commitment to the improvement of the lives of those folks in Pakistan who suffered a suffered mightily as a result of the natural disaster.","[INTERVIEWER] Yes, Kamran.","[INTERVIEWED]. Kamran.","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], being an ally, there are some expectations. We captured the top lot of the Al Qaida, and 300 Pakistani soldiers died. There is a lot of expectation in Pakistan you spoke about bilateral investment treaty and stuff, access to the market more on access to the market. Are we moving towards free trade?","And secondly, Pakistani students, sir, having terrible problems getting visas to the U.S. And that's very important folks not getting to the U.S. for education, and can you help us?","[INTERVIEWED]. A couple of points one, there's no question that the Musharraf Government is committed to working to get Al Qaida brought to justice. It was Al Qaida that tried to kill him more than one time. And he also recognizes Al Qaida's presence is destabilizing. Al Qaida doesn't care about the people of Pakistan. They don't care about helping people get a good education, realize the vast potential of Pakistan. They're there to create chaos and murder. And so I appreciate that, and I appreciate his firm resolve.","Secondly, we have been there is a tangible benefit for the Government and the security of Pakistan in dealing with using sharing with, providing equipment. We resolved a long-simmering issue in the F-16s. I recognize it has been put on hold, but the Government's commitment is a real commitment. It changed policy, as you recall. It reversed something that took place in the past.","The BIT is a beginning of it's a step toward what you talked about, advancing additional trading.","I agree with you on the issue of education. First of all, there are a lot of Pakistan citizens here, and a lot of Pakistani Americans that are making vital contributions to our country, proud United States citizens who honor their heritage.","I agree with you that there ought to be more student exchanges. But this is not an issue just for Pakistani students; this is an issue for students from other parts of the world as well. We had a very restrictive visa policy right after 9/11. It was a our visa policy was a natural reaction to a terrible event that took place. But by it didn't take me long to realize that we were missing a great opportunity to have students from Pakistan see the real America. And there's no better place, no better way in many ways to see America than to come as a student, study at our institutions, but more importantly, interface with people the same age and realize that ours is an accepting culture.","[INTERVIEWER] Absolutely.","[INTERVIEWED]. And we welcome Muslims. And we welcome people that may be different, and that there's no better ambassador for the American way of life and the attitudes the true attitudes of the American citizens than to have somebody here who has seen firsthand what America is like and then go back home. Word of mouth is a pretty significant antidote to some of the propaganda that is being played out for others to hear. And so I agree with you, and we're Condi Rice is very much involved with constantly revisiting the visa issue student visa issue, in particular, and not only encouraging students to come here, but once they're here, not making it difficult for them to complete their education. In other words, there are some restrictions even after the students got here.","Finally, we are also along these lines announced a very strong language initiative so that more people are capable of will be capable of conversing with people in parts of the world where, frankly, we haven't had that much conversation in their native language all aimed at creating a hospitable world. And this trip will help send a message to the people of Pakistan: One, we're proud of the Pakistani Americans who live here; two, we want this relation to continue on. It's a vital relationship. And as I say, I am pleased with my personal relationship with [INTERVIEWED] Musharraf. I try to put myself in his shoes. He is he's got a tough assignment. On the one hand, he's got people trying to kill him, and on the other hand, he's taking this country toward further down the road of democracy, and in so doing, is dealing with as we speak, dealing with people who are taking advantage of a free press.","And as I mentioned to you, I understand why people are reacting to that. It's very important, however, that they react in a way that does honor to the process and not resort to violence and destruction and, in some countries, to death.","And so looking forward to it. See you all there, I hope.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to Pakistan","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], one last","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER] About the visit, can you state if you ever think of canceling the visit","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I'm not going to never thought about canceling it.","[INTERVIEWER] No?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course not.","[INTERVIEWER] Because","[INTERVIEWED]. No, zero, zero chance.","[INTERVIEWER] So we are a good word for the students, they may get visas?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think we're working it very hard to make sure. Obviously, Ambassador Crocker and the Embassy there is the conscience. I will pass this on to Condi when I talk to her just to make sure that she's she's constantly calibrating and looking at the issue. We hear believe we've had a lot of there are a lot of folks here that in America, and a lot of Embassies around the world hear from respective governments when there's backlogs and slowness. These voices that are concerned about whether or not there's access to our universities are heard loud and clear. Believe me, it's","[INTERVIEWER] [INTERVIEWED], best antidote is exposing people to American people.","[INTERVIEWED]. There you go.","[INTERVIEWER] That's the best antidote you have.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you.","[INTERVIEWER] Don't restrict that.","[INTERVIEWED]. Don't worry. Glad you're here. Good job."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpakistantelevision","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., you are paying a visit to Pakistan at a very crucial juncture, at a time when changes are being experienced in the region. And people of Pakistan are pinning a lot of hope on your visit because they think many problems are there and your visit will play a very vital role in it. So what is your vision for making this trip more meaningful and productive?","[INTERVIEWED].. The first thing that's really important for people to understand is that relations between our countries oftentimes depend on the relations between the leaders. In other words, [INTERVIEWED] Musharraf and I can set a tone for the relationship because of our capacity to talk to each other. And it's important to be with each other and to share concerns and to talk about ideas. And so one object of the trip is to continue what is a good relationship. A good relationship between me and [INTERVIEWED]. tends to permeate throughout our Government.","Secondly, I and one reason we've got a good relationship is we speak frankly with each other. Listen, I understand he has got a difficult job made really difficult by the fact that people have tried to kill him, as you know. Extremists have decided that he is a obstacle to their vision and, therefore, have tried to kill him. And so he's not only a man who's shown great courage in the face of adversity, but he does have a vision of how to work together to achieve common objectives.","Secondly, I want the people of Pakistan to know that the American people care about them, that ours is a relationship that's much bigger than just the war on terror; that when our Chinooks flew supplies into the rural part of Pakistan, it wasn't out of a sense of just, kind of, pure diplomacy, it was out of a sense of care and concern about the individuals. And I understand sometimes people may have wonder about our motives, wonder about America's true concerns. And this will give me a chance to speak to the people of Pakistan and say, \"Look, we care for you,\" and remind people that in our country, there's great Pakistani Americans. We're a rich society because we've got people from around the world, including people who were born and raised in Pakistan and have now chosen America as a home. And so it's a trip that's of good will and importance.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., there is a common perception that the relations between the United States and Pakistan have fluctuated in the past. So what measures would you suggest to make it more durable and sustainable for the days to come and the long-time perspective?","[INTERVIEWED].. Yes, that's a really good question, because, again, we want people to understand this relationship is a vital relationship that will exist throughout the years. One way we can do that is increase trade opportunities before our countries between our countries. And we'll be talking about a bilateral investment treaty.","Secondly, student exchanges and I understand there's been some issues with visas, and we've got to work through those, because I believe the more Pakistani youngsters who come to America to study will get to really see what America is all about. And as more Americans that go there to study will see what Pakistan is all about.","And so there's ways for us, beyond the war on terror and by the way, the war on terror is a critical aspect of our relationship; don't get me wrong. But the other thing that's interesting and I think important for the people of Pakistan to know is that [INTERVIEWED] Musharraf, in his democracy initiative, can show the whole Muslim world, and the world itself, that it's possible to have a religious that is not extreme and a state that listens to people and responds to the needs of people. And that's a really important message that Pakistan can show the world. And I will, of course, continue to talk to my buddy and my friend about his goals for a democratic Pakistan.","Kashmir","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., an early solution to the whole issue of Kashmir, about which you have also mentioned in your speech at the Asia Society that is vital for the region. So, in your view, being a close friend of both Pakistan and India, what role the United States can play in resolving this issue?","[INTERVIEWED].. Well, I started to play a role in my speech, and I spoke out on the issue and encouraged [INTERVIEWED]. and the Prime Minister of India to continue down the road of solving the issue with a solution that's acceptable to all sides.","And that's very important. There's a temptation sometimes for countries to try to jump in the middle of dialog. I believe a lasting solution can be achieved. I've seen the progress that's been made in the relationship from when I first became [INTERVIEWED]. You might remember an early time in my Presidency, there was real tension. And now, all of a sudden, there's some very encouraging signs transportation exchanges not transportation exchanges new transportation opportunities, trade. In just my discussions with both [INTERVIEWED]. and the Prime Minister, there appears to be a different attitude. And part of it has to do with trust, but there's got to be tangible progress; I recognize that. And so I will use my trip to urge the leadership to continue solving this issue, with the idea that it can be solved.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]., what economic incentive would you offer to Pakistan during the forthcoming visit?","[INTERVIEWED].. Well, trade is very important. And one of the steps on a robust trading relationship is what's called the Bilateral Investment Treaty, and that's an important part of the process. And believe me, every time [INTERVIEWED]. talks to me, he's talking about markets, and I understand that. But he also understands that there's some steps needed before this robust trade.","I must applaud [INTERVIEWED].'s vision for the Pakistan economy. And in our world, politics, there's a lot of talk and a lot of, kind of, big noise. But the truth of the matter is, what matters is results. And Pakistan's economy is strong, and that's good news. That's really good news for the people of Pakistan. First and foremost, because, obviously, if people can make a living and do well, they can see the benefits of democracy tangible benefits of living in a system where people are free to express themselves, but where the marketplace is the economic determinant.","[INTERVIEWER]. Coming to another subject, what strategy the United States has adopted for conquering terrorism in Pakistan, in a very holistic manner?","[INTERVIEWED].. First of all, freedom defeats an ideology of hatred. And the enemy I say \"the enemy\" because they'll kill they innocent Pakistanis; they kill innocent Americans. We need more Muslims have died at the hands of Al Qaida and these extremists than anybody else. These I don't view these people as religious people. I view them as people who have taken a great religion and kind of twisted it to meet their means.","And so they have a vision. And it's not a vision it's a vision that doesn't recognize the freedom of people to worship. It's a vision that doesn't understand the that recognize the importance of women in society or free speech. And so the way to defeat that vision is with a better vision, more hopeful, and democracy provides that vision.","We are in close coordination, of course, with the Government of Pakistan. We share a mutual interest. Nobody should want foreign fighters in their soil wreaking havoc. And it's hard for a part of a country to develop if there are people in that part of the country that are willing to kill innocent life to achieve an objective. And so we share short-term objectives with the Pakistani Government. We also share the long-term objective, and that is that's freedom.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED]..","[INTERVIEWED].. I'm looking forward to the trip. And I really appreciate you coming.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. I'm grateful and honored.","[INTERVIEWED].. Thank you, sir."]}

On the beginning of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, what message do you wish to share with the people of Iran, especially with the Iranian women, as well as the young generation?","[INTERVIEWED]. First, that the United States of America wishes everybody a happy New Year. Secondly, that the United States people of the United States respects the great Iranian history and culture. We have great respect for the people. And we've got problems with the Government. We have problems with the Government because the Government has been threatening, has made decisions that and statements that really have isolated the people of Iran.","My message to the young in Iran is that someday your society will be free, and it will be a blessed time for you. My message to the women of Iran is that the women of America share your deep desire for children to be to grow up in a hopeful society and to live in peace.","Iran/Freedom Agenda","[INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of women of Iran, [INTERVIEWED], the majority of population in Iran are women. And even in the Iranian culture they are considered the foundation on which men deeply rely. Is there any plan or could there be one to promote and engage the Iranian women in the U.S. to a unified and centralized movement for a free and democratic Iran?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the people of Iran are going to have to come to the conclusion that a free country is in their interest. We, of course, support freedom movements all around the world. We're supporting a freedom movement on the Iranian border in Iraq. We are promoting and helping the Iraqis develop a free society. By the way, a free Iraq will help the Iranians see the blessings of a free society.","There's no doubt in my mind that the women will be leading freedom movements in Iran and elsewhere. And the role of the United States is to provide, you know, moral support without and other support without undermining their cause.","Iraq/Iran","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], in this fifth anniversary of the Iraq war, what impact do you think a peaceful solution on the Iranian nuclear crisis and a normalization of our relations with Iran would have on the security and political situation in Iraq and more generally in the whole Middle East?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that success in Iraq will first of all depend upon the Iraqis' desire to reconcile their differences and to live in peace, and that's happening. It's hard work to overcome the a dictatorship like Saddam Hussein's, but nevertheless, most Iraqis want to live in peace with their neighbor.","Secondly, a peaceful Iraq will depend upon making it clear to the Iranians to stop exporting weapons from Iran into Iraq that arm militias and arm criminal gangs that cause there to be harm for the innocent people.","Thirdly, it's very important for the neighborhood to understand that the United States is committed to peace and that we're not that we won't be run out because of violence; that we believe that we're there for the right reason, which is to promote freedom and peace.","The free you know, there's a chance that the U.S. and Iran can reconcile their differences, but the Government is going to have to make some make different choices. And one is to verifiably suspend the enrichment of uranium, at which time there is a way forward. And the Iranian people have got to understand that the United States is going to be firm in our desire to prevent the nation from developing a nuclear weapon, but reasonable in our desire to see to it that you have civilian nuclear power without you know, without enabling the Government to enrich.","And the problem is, is that they have not told the truth in the past. And therefore, it's very difficult for the United States and the rest of the world or much of the rest of the world to trust the Iranian Government when it comes to telling the truth. And so I support the Russian proposal to provide Iran with enriched uranium to go into a civilian nuclear power plant.","There's a way forward. In other words, I don't know what the Iranian people believe about the United States, but they must believe that we have proposed a way forward that will yield to peace. And it's their Government that is resisting these changes.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you and your allies launched a global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism, what do you think is your most important challenge to expose and stop the secretive ambition of Iran's Government to enrich uranium, while assuring its citizens that their happiness and prosperity and peace is a benefit within their reach?","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure, absolutely. Well, one thing is, is to reiterate my belief that the Iranians should have a civilian nuclear power program. It's in their right to have it. The problem is the Government cannot be trusted to enrich uranium because, one, they've hidden programs in the past, and they may be hiding one now, who knows; and secondly, they've declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people some in the Middle East. And that's unacceptable to the United States, and it's unacceptable to the world.","But what is acceptable to me is to work with a nation like Russia to provide the fuel so that the plan can go forward, and which therefore makes it you know, it shows that the Iranian Government doesn't need to learn to enrich.","My only point to the Iranian people is we want you to be able to realize your sovereign rights. The Government has been duplicitous to the world. Very few people trust your Government. And if the Government changes its behavior, there's a better way forward for the Iranian people.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED], world democracy is everyone's rightful way of life. In Iran, on the other hand, there is no respect for the basic rights of Iranian citizen; there is no rule of law; and there is no, certainly, the freedom of speech. Do you believe that the people of Iran stand a chance against this regime, to bring about the positive change in anytime soon with your support?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would like very much for the Iranian people to realize a society based upon rule of law and free speech and free worship of religion. There's nothing I'd like to see more than a society in which young girls can grow up to realize their dreams with a good education system.","You know, this is a this regime, however, is one that sometimes when people express themselves in an open way, there can be serious punishment. This is a regime that says they have elections, but they get to decide who's on the ballot, which is not a free and fair election. So this is a regime and a society that's got a long way to go. But the people of Iran can be rest assured the United States, whether I'm [INTERVIEWED] or the next [INTERVIEWED], will strongly support their desires to live in a free society.","[INTERVIEWER]. May I have, [INTERVIEWED], my last question?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. You said many times that the U.S. missile defense system in Czech and Poland is to defend America and its European allies from attack by rogue states such as Iran. But some this argument is still between U.S. and Russia. Are you optimistic to solve the problem?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's interesting you ask that question. We intend to move forward with the and the Czech Republic and Poland, for the good of NATO. Obviously, it'd be make life easier if the Russians and the United States cooperated in such a missile defense. Condi Rice and Bob Gates Secretary Gates, Secretary Rice were in Russia this past couple of days talking about the very subject, as to whether or not we can find grounds to cooperate. The missile systems, defense systems, would not be aimed at Russia; they'd be aimed at nations that would, you know, try to hold the free world hostage with a nuclear weapon.","And so it's I'm optimistic. I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know whether we can find common ground. But we are trying to find common ground, and that's what's that's the first step, is to make the attempt.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you so much, [INTERVIEWED], for your time.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, ma'am, thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpatrobertsonthechristianbroadcastingnetwork","text":[" ","[INTERVIEWER]. The 40th [INTERVIEWED] of the United States. When historians write about the Reagan administration, what do you want them to say?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, I've been asked that, and I guess I have to say, I've never thought that far ahead. I'm so busy thinking about what we want to accomplish. I guess maybe just that I helped perpetuate this great American dream.","Administration Goals","[INTERVIEWER]. What do you hope for in the next 3 years?","[INTERVIEWED]. There are so many things. I would like to get us definitely on the pattern of reducing the deficit so that the balanced budget is in view. I would like to have, then, going into effect at that time a balanced budget amendment so we could never again go a half a century, as we have, of regularly deficit spending each year. And I would like to see us also have some plan for beginning installments to start reducing the national debt, as we have done many times in the past. There are a number of things that I would like to see—resolve the problem of prayer in schools and have us on the road, a good solid road that could make us optimistic about the chances for peace.","Budget Deficit and Tax Reform","[INTERVIEWER]. On the budget deficit, it seems as if members of your own party are not totally in accord with you. The Congress hasn't supported you. Are you optimistic? David Stockman said maybe this is the last chance, but you're optimistic about the future?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I am. There's no way that anyone could ever balance the budget in 1 year. This budget, over the years, has been structurally built into our budgeting process. And the difficulty, of course, is getting agreement not on the need to reduce it—everyone seems to agree on that—but then trying to get them to agree on, well, where do you apply the tourniquet and shut off that hemorrhage of funds. But I think that we're on the beginning of a track where we can see a progression of reducing the deficit as a percentage of gross national product.","You know, if you just count the deficit in dollars—and it looks so horrifying—and you say, \"How did this ever happen?\" Well, if you look at it back over these 50 years of deficit spending on the basis of what it is as a percentage of gross national product, that, too, has been growing bigger. So, it isn't as far out of line with past deficits; some of them were just about as big as this one is in that percentage. But if we can get on a percentage to where, for these next 3 years—what we have in mind is if we can get it next year down to 4 percent of the gross national product, 3 percent the following year, 2 percent the next year, we think that that progression will point us to, by 1990, a balanced budget and then you could have go into effect the balanced budget amendment.","[INTERVIEWER]. I spoke to an influential Republican Senator on Sunday who felt that, possibly, the tax reform measure might be diverting attention away from deficit reduction. Do you see that as a complement to it or possibly a stimulant for it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Actually, a stimulant for it in a way, because if you look back, not just in our administration and what we did in 1981 when we implemented—or began implementing our tax cuts, but go back to [INTERVIEWED] Kennedy's across-the-board tax cut, before that to [INTERVIEWED] Coolidge and the tax cuts that he implemented—in every instance the economic growth has resulted in the Government getting more revenues at the lower rates than it was getting at the higher rates. So, I think this tax reform very definitely would help. It isn't aimed at being a part of that, but it would help in that it would stimulate economic growth and I think would actually, thus, result in increased revenues.","[INTERVIEWER]. This has been spoken of as a profamily tax measure. How will that help the families in your estimate?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let's start right off with someone down there at the lower end of the earning scale. One of the features of this is that the personal exemption is increased to $4,000 and then the deduction for dependents is almost doubled to $2,000 apiece instead of the present 1,040. So, you take a family of four, you've got $8,000 of nontaxable income to begin with right there. And that plus the reduced rates—we believe that—and first of all, so many of our people can't and don't take advantage of many of the loopholes that others have been able to use to reduce their fair share of the tax burden. So, it is very definitely aimed at families and that was sort of proven the other day when the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives-so, I'm not just citing a Republican measure-in the Committee on Children, Youth, and Family have made a study of this tax proposal plus all the others that are before the Congress and said flatly this one is the most profamily of all of the tax proposals.","[INTERVIEWER]. Is the $2,000 personal exemption, dependent's exemption, is that a non-negotiable feature? Would you veto a bill if it didn't have that in it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it just has to have it, and let me give you my thinking on that. Some years ago, as you know, that deduction was $600 and then inflation took hold and has kept coming on. And finally, someone got around to increasing the 600 to 1,040. But right now, actually, if we had kept up with inflation, the deduction should be $2,700. Now, we couldn't remain revenue neutral and go that high, but going to $2,000 is eminently justified simply on the matter of—that actually, in purchasing power, that's smaller than the $600 was back in 1948.","[INTERVIEWER]. There's no lobby for it, though; among the people, the vast numbers will help. So would you, in a sense, be their champion and go the mount on that issue?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, and I have to say, though, that I haven't heard here, from Democrats or Republicans, any objection to those figures. There have been some of the loopholes or deductions, other areas that people have thought should be retained, and there's been argument about that. But I haven't heard anyone raise a complaint about these personal exemptions.","Administration Accomplishments","[INTERVIEWER]. One oblique question. I read that the reason that you and Franklin Roosevelt were so tremendously popular is because you gave the American people hope. Looking down the road, what cause do you have for hope?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm an eternal optimist, I know; but I can't help but have hope. Just a few years ago, we were seeing our streets torn up with rioting and demonstrations of various kinds, but we also were seeing a lack of hope. We were hearing talk that we were no longer a nation of growth and so forth; that we must begin to limit ourselves in our expectations, and our government itself was telling that to the people. And here, today, in these few short years, double-digit inflation is down to less than 4 percent and still on its way down; interest rates, the prime rate had reached 21 1/2 percent, and it is down to far less than a half of that now, and still, I believe, they're going down. In the last 33 months, we have created more than 8 million new jobs. And today—you know what is referred to as the employment pool is everyone in the United States—male and female between the age of 16 and 65 are known as the potential labor pool—that if all of them sought work—they're all employable. The highest percentage of that labor pool is employed now than has ever been employed before in our history. And the growth in the recovery has been the greatest that we've known in any recovery from any previous recession or depression.","But even more than that, there is something out there—you get out on the road and talk to the people. There is a spirit. Our young people, who once were, as you know, totally disillusioned with government and so forth over the Vietnam war—the resurgence of patriotism among them. And now with our volunteer military—no longer having to have a draft—I don't know of anything I am more proud of than our young men and women in uniform and their spirit.","Nancy Reagan","[INTERVIEWER]. I ask you a question for the women viewers in our audience. You've just gone through a very critical medical problem, and we know how close you and your wife Nancy are. It is almost a fabled love affair—better than Hollywood could do it. What was her reaction? How did she handle this crisis?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, she is very courageous, and once upon a time when she was younger she was one of those—what did they call them—those nurses aides that-during war time and all. So, that part, she was on the Job. But she also is a very great worrier, and let me put it this way: I've recovered quicker than she did.","[INTERVIEWER]. It was a terrible crisis. This is the second one. Some of your very close friends from California have gone back into private enterprise or gone back home. Are you turning more to your wife for counsel? She's a very wise lady.","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, listen, we have always talked over everything together. I couldn't imagine it being otherwise. But as to the people leaving the administration, I've expected that. I had 8 years experience in California. And I made it plain from the beginning that these people—I would take them even if it was only for a year or 2 years and then find someone else if and when they had to return to their own careers. And I think it should be that way if you're going to get—well, I always put it this way. I wanted people in government that really didn't want a job in government, but that were willing to come and serve rather than those that were seeking government jobs. And the result is, you know that they will have to go back to their own careers sooner or later.","But, no, Nancy and I—we don't have any secrets from each other.","American Hostages in Lebanon","[INTERVIEWER]. We were very heartened to learn that Reverend Weir had been released from Lebanon, and word reached us that a member of the White House staff was dispatched on Sunday, I believe, to Iran to seek the release of the remaining six—and actually it was seven at that time. Is there any word on that that might give hope to us?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I can't really talk about what we are doing, because I don't want to do anything that will endanger the prospects of the others being freed. I can only say that we have explored every avenue. We've been working for this for all the time since the first one, Mr. Buckley, was kidnaped. And I know that some of the families have grown impatient, because if they don't see things in the paper, they don't think we're doing anything. But going public and being in the paper is not the way to get a Reverend Weir back or any of the others.","[INTERVIEWER]. Could we say cautiously optimistic, or is there anything that we can say to characterize it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I have to remain cautiously optimistic. And we are continuing the efforts that—and we've explored and been trying in every avenue that is open to us. But, again, it's something I can't talk about because, as I say, there is a risk in all of this for them.","Soviet Propoganda","[INTERVIEWER]. You're getting ready for the summit. Is the American press—and a free press is so important in our nation but is it from time to time being manipulated by the Soviet Union to sort of stack the deck against you in this summit meeting?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I did begin to feel there for a while that when the summit started they'd be rooting for the other side; that he was wearing the white hat, and I was wearing the black hat. You know, that's an old Hollywood expression, that you identify the villain as— [INTERVIEWER]. I know.","[INTERVIEWED]. —by the color of the hat. I think what should be better understood by our people—and this isn't any criticism of our press—the Soviet Union has a worldwide disinformation network, and it's very effective. And they can get many things published and broadcast and so forth to suit their ends and in their drives, for example, to try to create some friction among us and our allies. And I don't think we have anything comparable to that.","Free and Fair Trade","[INTERVIEWER]. One last question. I see that our time has run out. If the Congress gives you a trade protectionist bill having either a tariff or a surcharge or some other name, will you veto it?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll have to. That's one of the advantages of being my age. I was looking for work in the Great Depression, and I know what the Smoot-Hawley bill did, the world trade war that it created. There is no way that that can win—protectionism for, say, a particular industry—no one ever looks over their shoulder to see how many people in other industries lost their jobs-because it's a two-way street, and retaliation sets in. We are still the greatest exporter in the world. And even though there is a great trade imbalance right now, that we're importing far more than we're exporting, that is not because we have reduced our exports, as big as they ever were. We have increased our imports because of the value of our dollar and the fact that our trading partners have not had the economic recovery we've had, so their prices are low. And you can't blame people for picking up a bargain.","[INTERVIEWER]. What they need is a dose of Reaganomics in Europe, is that what you say?","[INTERVIEWED]. Exactly. As a matter of fact, they themselves admit that in their systems there are so many rigidities in labor laws and everything else that have been built in that they have not had the recovery. Indeed, when I was at the recent economic summit, the last summit in May, they called to my face, they called what we have is the miracle of America. So, we've tried to pass on to them information that we think would help them have some miracles.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much. This has been wonderful. [INTERVIEWED]. Well— [INTERVIEWER]. God bless you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, thank you very much, and, in saying that, let me tell you, when you asked about the future and why I was optimistic and all, I am convinced this is a nation under God and as long as we recognize that, believe that, I think he'll help us.","[INTERVIEWER]. There's no question about it. That's the greatest cause for optimism I know of. Thank you very much, sir. [INTERVIEWED]. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpauldukeandmartinagronskythepublicbroadcastingservice","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. [1.] [INTERVIEWED], we are delighted to join you here today in the Solarium on the third floor of the White House, a charming and homey room.","As you now round out your first year in the White House, do you feel at home here? Do you find that you enjoy the \"splendid misery\" of the Presidency, to use those famous words of Thomas Jefferson?","[INTERVIEWED]. Paul, I think my family as well as myself enjoy living here. It is a magnificent home, of course. It can get a little lonely at times. It is big, but there are so many wonderful things here that you can enjoy. It is a super place to live.","It also gives you an opportunity to focus in on the problems, and it is the problems that come with the house that make it somewhat difficult at times to really relax and enjoy yourself.","[INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of those problems, [INTERVIEWED], I think many people regarded you as something of an interim [INTERVIEWED] when you first assumed office. Do you feel now that a year later, that you have established a Ford Presidency?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we have gradually put together a domestic program and a foreign policy that can be identified as a Ford Administration. As we move in the next 12 to 14 months, I think it will become more and more evident, which, of course, gives us an opportunity in the next election to lay that record out so the public can judge it against any alternative programs submitted by the opposition.","I don't think there will be any problem in identifying what we have done, what we have tried to do, and it will be known as a Ford policy or a Ford program, so to speak.","MR. AGRONSKY. Let us look back at that first year in the terms that you give, [INTERVIEWED]. What would you pick out as the things you have done in this first year that make it indeed a Ford Presidency, both in domestic and foreign policy?","[INTERVIEWED]. Before getting into foreign and domestic policy, Martin, I think it is entirely proper to say that I have tried to restore public confidence in the Government and, particularly, in the Administration, in the executive branch, in the White House. I don't mean to criticize anybody else, but all the polls showed that roughly a year ago there had been a great loss of confidence on the part of the American people in their Government. We, the new Administration, with our appointments, with our openness, with our attempt to be frank and honest with the American people, I think we have turned the corner, and there is a restored confidence on behalf of the American people in their Government.","Now, let's turn to the policy areas. We inherited a very difficult economic situation. The rate of inflation was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent, the highest in a good many years. That was our immediate economic problem, and we undertook some activities both fiscally and in a monetary sense to correct the situation. I am glad to report that it is now somewhere between 5 and 6 percent per annum. That is too high, and we had a little setback the last announcement on the CPI, the Consumer Price Index.","MR. AGRONSKY. In fact, it indicates it is going to go up 14 percent if it continues at this rate.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think--that is the new wholesale price figure that came out this morning. But if you annualize the last 6 months of the Wholesale Price Index, it shows it is almost zero, because we had 5 months of, as I recall, negative increases in the Wholesale Price Index. So, I think you have to look at it in the broad span. We have made significant progress in the field of inflation, and we are going to continue to do so. It is important. Then, of course, we were faced in January with a precipitous drop in employment and a tremendous increase in unemployment. We adjusted our economic policies to meet that problem without sacrificing our effort against inflation.","We did have an increase of unemployment up to 9.2 percent--much, much too high--but the last 2 months the unemployment figure has gone down from 9.2 to 8.4, and the most encouraging part is the fact that we have had an increase in employment of about 600,000, as I recall the figure. That is the encouraging thing. We are putting people back to work even though the unemployment figure is still too high.","Now, this is a very narrow line to follow of still .trying to control inflation and at the same time reduce unemployment. I can just assure you we are going to follow a steady, firm, I think, correct policy to meet these two challenges.","THE NATION'S ECONOMY","[2.] [INTERVIEWER]. When you referred to a correct policy, [INTERVIEWED], I would like to remind you that it seems to us that in the past 2 or 3 weeks we have had an awakening, new concern that inflation may take off again, that unemployment is going to remain quite high through the election year of 1976. So, do you plan any new measures to deal with the economy?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we have to make certain that the policies we have undertaken are continued. Now those policies are what?","If we were to go along with the Congress that wants to spend a great deal more money--I drew the line at a deficit of $60 billion--the Congressional figures are up to $70 billion or $80 billion deficit for the current fiscal year--if we were to go along with that kind of a deficit figure that the Congress proposes, I think we would be in serious trouble on the reigniting of inflation. So, we are still going to veto bills that accelerate expenditures in the Federal Government beyond a reasonable figure.","On the other hand, with the restoration of public confidence by our, I think, responsible action, I believe that we are going to regenerate industrial activity, which means more jobs.","Now, let me take one aspect of the last 6 months. We have had the most rapid inventory sell-off in the history of the United States. It is almost unbelievable. The net result is that current inventories in many, many areas of the country, in industries in the country, are down. So, they have to come up with additional production to meet current daily demand.","With consumer confidence coming back the way it has--and all the pollsters show that--I think our steady, firm, responsible course is going to meet the challenge of inflation and unemployment. They won't be as good as we would like--I am very honest and very frank about it--but we will be moving in the right direction.","MR. AGRONSKY. Let us take the direction in which we are moving, which we are in today, leaving percentages aside. We have got better than 8 million Americans who don't have jobs. We reckon now that there are something like 24 million Americans--12 percent of the population of this country--that are at the poverty level or below.","And many of your critics make the point that while you are a good man and a decent man, you don't show a sufficient amount of compassion, in their opinion, for the people who are unfortunate in that sense, for the people who are on welfare and people who live on food stamps.","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin, our welfare program is very generous. Our food stamp program is very generous. A good many Americans think that there are too many abuses both in welfare and food stamps, and I think there are too many abuses. If we could correct the abuses, we could be more compassionate to the people who have a real need for both welfare and/or food stamps or both.","Now, you know, inflation, Martin, hits the unemployed even more drastically than it hurts the people who are employed, so my compassion is across the spectrum. It is not just aimed at the people who are employed. We want to control inflation to help all Americans, including the unemployed. If we don't control inflation, the ones who are hurt the most are the people who are unemployed and the people on fixed incomes.","MR. AGRONSKY. [INTERVIEWED], no one would argue that inflation isn't a threat, but the concern is that you seem to be more worried, really, constantly--and it is a conscious decision on the part of your Administration--with inflation than you have been with unemployment. And generally the whole thrust--","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin, I must respectfully disagree with you. This Administration has extended the unemployment compensation program to, I think, 65 weeks. We have broadened the eligibility of unemployment beyond what it ever was in the United States. We have paid more money out in unemployment benefits than any administration has ever done. So, we have shown in dollars and in programs a deep concern for the unemployed. We have gone along with a public service employment program up to the maximum authorized by the Congress.","MR. AGRONSKY. But yet you have also vetoed an effort for a job bill that was passed by the Congress.","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin, that was, I think, a poor label for a bad piece of legislation. The facts are, I sent up a request for $1,900 million for public service employment or a jobs bill that included $450 million for a summer youth employment program and the remainder for the public service employment. That shows my interest in the youth who wanted employment this summer, and it shows my interest in the people we could hire in the public service area.","Now, what the Congress did was to take my recommendation and add $3 billion in pork-barrel programs that wouldn't have solved the problem of the people unemployed today. It was pure Congressional politics of a pork-barrel kind, and that is the reason I vetoed it. And what happened? After I vetoed it, the Congress recognized they were wrong and they sent back a bill that included my public service employment, my summer youth program, and added a few hundred million dollars just to satisfy their ego. Now, the truth is we got a good program through and we didn't get a pork-barrel program shoved down the American people.","VIEWS ON THE PRESIDENCY","[3.] [INTERVIEWER]. Let me take this to a somewhat different plane, [INTERVIEWED]. There are critics who suggest that you have not provided the kind of broad roadmap for the country's future which this Nation with its many problems desperately needs today.","James Reston, writing in the New York Times yesterday, suggested there remains a strain of doubt about your leadership. David Broder, in the Washington Post, suggested that you may in reality be a provisional [INTERVIEWED].","Does it disturb you that you do not appear to have captured the hearts and minds of a great many Americans?","[INTERVIEWED]. I read both of those articles, and they are very able columnists. I think we will, with the next State of the Union message, have some areas that will point the direction in the long run for our country.","I instituted this year what we call a \"no new program\" approach. Why did we do that? We had to solve our current problems first in order to get our fiscal situation under control. Once we have achieved that result--and I think we have made substantial headway--then we can take a look at and make recommendations for the long range that will meet some of the problems that are raised by Scotty Reston and Dave Broder, and by others.","MR. AGRONSKY. How do you deal with this perception that people have about the lack of leadership, and not only for you but for the Republican Party?","For example, Senator Brock of Tennessee, of your party, said the Republican Party must come to stand for something and until it does that the word \"Republican\" will be associated with Watergate and big business, hard times.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I, of course, deny that this Administration, the Ford Administration, is in any way whatsoever connected with Watergate. The Ford Administration is going to be known, in my judgment, for a successful implementation of economic policy that will provide jobs in the private sector in the long run and in foreign policy will expand our efforts for peace throughout the world. That is what this Administration will stand for. I think those are good things for an administration to be remembered over the years. MR. AGRONSKY. If you achieve them. THE [INTERVIEWED] . I think the record is going to be good, and I think right now the public, if you look at the polls, is beginning to perceive that.","The polls show that, on a personal basis, I am doing much better. It is not as high as I would like, but not many people in public life are doing very well in the polls.","[INTERVIEWER]. But also, [INTERVIEWED], the polls show that only 7 of 100 Americans-by one pollster who happens to be from your home State, Robert Teeter-that only 7 of 100 Americans today regard themselves as strict Republicans. I think this relates additionally to the fact that rightly or wrongly, many Members of Congress and elsewhere, your critics, detect a negative quality about your leadership. And doesn't that do damage perhaps to your own Presidency and to the Republican Party?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me quote, if I might, some other statistics. Most polls that are taken today indicate that a majority of Americans are in the middle of the road or conservative. Now they don't label themselves as Democrats or Republicans. They are talking about a philosophy. And maybe labels today are not the right way to identify people's views, whether it is Democrat or Republican. I believe the American people want a healthy economy, a firm and successful foreign policy. That is what we are going to give them, and that is what we are giving them at the present time.","[INTERVIEWER]. When you talk about a healthy economy, [INTERVIEWED], there are other problems as well. What do we do about the rising cost of medical care, what do we do about the 12 percent of the population which Martin referred to which is now at the poverty level in this country? What do we do about the enormous problems of the cities which seem to be accelerating?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let us take the last one first. I think the cities have to recognize that they have a responsibility in the fiscal area as well. The Federal Government has done a substantial amount for cities through the general revenue sharing program, through a multitude of categorical grant programs. The cities have to realize that they have a fiscal management problem, too, and many of them have. Many of our cities are well managed; a few are not. [INTERVIEWER]. New York, for example?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think the record speaks for itself.","WELFARE REFORM","[4.] [INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], in one area, the welfare area, your outgoing Welfare Secretary Weinberger suggested the other day that we should now be giving thought to some kind of negative income tax, in effect, a guaranteed annual income. Is that in the future as far as your Administration is concerned?","[INTERVIEWED]. Sometime this fall, there will be conducted under our Domestic Council--and the Vice [INTERVIEWED] is acting Chairman, Vice Chairman, but the actual acting Chairman of the Domestic Council--and he and his associates are going to conduct some public hearings around the country where a number of areas will be examined by that Council, where people in various communities will have an opportunity to testify, proponents of one approach or another approach. It won't be an organized effort to direct them any way.","Some people say we should modify the present welfare program. Some say we should junk it and come in with a new one. There are a number of other alternatives.","What we are going to do through the Domestic Council is give people throughout the country, not just the Washington complex, an opportunity to express themselves, to tell us what they think is the answer to the welfare problem. There is an awful lot of wisdom out in the country on what's right and what's wrong about welfare, what we today ought to do about medical care and the costs and the program. And as a result of those hearings on a nationwide basis, we will formulate our recommendations in those areas that need change.","[INTERVIEWER]. But the decision does have to be made here, [INTERVIEWED]. The decision has to be made ultimately in the Oval Office. And what is your thinking? Is it your thinking that the welfare system in this country is now in such a chaotic mess that some new system must be devised, and it is likely that some form of guaranteed annual income which was a concept that was put forward by Richard Nixon?","[INTERVIEWED]. There is no doubt that the present welfare program either ought to be junked and a substitute put in its place or the present welfare program has to be tightened up very, very greatly. Now, you can get proponents on either side.","When I was in the House of Representatives, I voted twice for the program that was submitted by the previous administration, because I believed then and now that welfare reform was mandatory. Unfortunately, even though the House of Representatives passed that legislation twice, the United States Senate refused or didn't act on it.","Now, it is my judgment that we will come out of these public hearings, we will come up with either some tightening of the existing welfare program or will offer a substitute, and there are a number of alternatives.","I am not going to prejudge what the public is going to tell us. We want the public to be a participant in this process.","WATERGATE","[5.] MR. AGRONSKY. [INTERVIEWED], could we return to the question of confidence, which is a real concern. You have been [INTERVIEWED] for a year, and looking back, would you agree with the conventional wisdom, as far as Watergate is concerned, that the system worked? THE [INTERVIEWED]:. I think the system did work, Martin. It went through a very traumatic period, but if you look back through what happened before August 9 and what has happened since, I think you must come to the conclusion that the system did work.","MR. AGRONSKY. And looking ahead beyond that, do you think that in this year that you have been in office that safeguards have been put into effect that would ensure that we would not have another Watergate? Do you feel there is a sense in the country that you have achieved that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Certainly what I have tried to do precludes a Watergate from happening under a Ford Administration, and I believe through the press, through the public, through the Congress, there would never be an opportunity for another Watergate to take place.","MR. AGRONSKY. Let me ask you to deal then with a rather remarkable and startling observation that was made to me by the Special Watergate Prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, a few days ago. I asked Mr. Jaworski, if your predecessor had destroyed the Watergate tapes, would he be sitting today in the White House, and he answered \"Yes.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. I wouldn't undercut any judgment by Leon Jaworski. He knew intimately the content of many of the tapes, and he had a special responsibility. So, if he made that judgment, I am certainly not going to contradict it.","CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY","[6.] MR. AGRONSKY. Let us carry it, not only the judgment but its implications-and you know the famous observation of Congressman Mann, \"Next time will there be a watchman in the night?\" What concerns everyone in the country is that after Watergate, we now have a crisis of confidence, in the CIA, for example, a feeling that it is out of hand, that it is not sufficiently accountable. That has to be an enormous concern for you as [INTERVIEWED]. How do you feel about the revelations of CIA? How do you relate them to the crisis of confidence?","[INTERVIEWED]. As a result of some of the revelations, I appointed the Rockefeller Commission. That Commission conducted a very thorough investigation of the allegations concerning the CIA. That Commission has recommended to me certain administrative actions that I should take and some legislative proposals that I should submit to the Congress. My staff has taken the Rockefeller Commission recommendations and the Murphy Commission recommendations-and that Commission got into the CIA to some extent--and I intend to submit to the Congress specific proposals that I think will maintain the CIA and our total intelligence-gathering community so they can do the job which is essential for our national security on the one hand and at the same time preclude our intelligence-gathering agencies from violating our constitutional rights as individuals.","MR. AGRONSKY. That is a point that I would like to raise with you. A man that you admire very much, one of your late predecessors, Harry Truman, in conversations with Merle Miller on his concept of the Presidency, remarked on the CIA, and I quote Mr. Truman: \"Now, those fellows in the CIA don't just report on wars and the like. They go out and make their own and there is nobody to keep track of what they are up to. They spend billions of dollars on stirring up trouble so they will have something to report on. They become a government all its own and all secret. They don't have to account to anybody. That is a very dangerous thing in a democratic society.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the recommendations that have come from the Rockefeller Commission and from the Murphy Commission and the result of the investigations in the House as well as the Senate, I think, will give to the Congress and to the [INTERVIEWED] the tools to correct the abuses that Mr. Truman spoke of in his conversations. MR. AGRONSKY. And that you perceive?","[INTERVIEWED]. And that I think have to be done in the future to eliminate any possibility of abuses such as Mr. Truman mentioned.","MR. AGRONSKY. [INTERVIEWED], the feeling is that perhaps you yourself as [INTERVIEWED], in terms of the record of the Presidency versus the CIA, may not even be aware of many areas in which the CIA operates.","[INTERVIEWED]. I can assure you, Martin, of two things. One, as a Member of the House and a member of a committee that had some jurisdiction over the CIA, but more specifically as [INTERVIEWED], I have probably gotten into the operations of the CIA and other related intelligence agencies in greater depth than any other [INTERVIEWED]. And as a consequence, the proposals that I will submit and the administrative actions that I will take will correct those alleged and actual abuses. I think I know more about the CIA than any other [INTERVIEWED], certainly since 1945 or 1946 when it was established, and either in the rules and regulations or the law or the personnel, we are going to make certain that the CIA does its job in the gathering of foreign intelligence and the analyzation of that intelligence for the benefit of the [INTERVIEWED], the Department of State, and the Secretary of Defense, and at the same time will not abuse the proper constitutional rights of 214 million Americans. We are going to do that.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], you served in Congress for a long time and Congress is the people's instrument that was really supposed to be protecting us against the excesses of the CIA. It is obvious now that Congress never did its job adequately. Did you ever have any inkling when you say you have been familiar with the CIA since 1946--did you ever have any inkling that these things were going on?","[INTERVIEWED]. I must admit, Paul, that I was not familiar with some of the details that have been brought to light. I was among a very limited number of Members of Congress, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, who analyzed the CIA budget and their overall programs. But I must admit that that kind of control by the Congress, in retrospect, was not adequate.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel that members of the CIA lied to you as a Member of Congress?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I do not think they lied to me. I won't pass judgment on what they said to others. But I do believe that the control of the CIA by the Congress over a period of years was not as sufficient as it should have been.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel this is now essential for the future, that Congress must exercise greater control over the CIA?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think there has to be some improvement in this area, but I am not passing judgment on this program as to the specific recommendations I will make. We are now analyzing various proposals, and what the Congress does, of course, is their decision. But I can make recommendations as to how we can tighten up the control and at the same time give to the [INTERVIEWED] and other people who have an interest the information on foreign intelligence which is so essential to our national security. You have to balance the two, and that is a very fine line. And I think we can do it. We are certainly going to try.","[INTERVIEWER]. The Attorney General, Mr. Levi, in reading the material which you sent over from the White House which has not been released to the public about CIA activities, said he was appalled by some of the things he read. Were you appalled?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think some of the things were improper, but I must say, Paul, people can judge what others have done and unfortunately sometimes don't put themselves in the position of a previous [INTERVIEWED] or put themselves in the position of a previous Secretary of Defense. I think we can recognize the areas of mistake, but I don't like to be a Monday-morning quarterback. I think we ought to deal with the facts and we ought to deal with what we should do in the future and learn from the past, and I think we can correct these things.","MR. AGRONSKY. What we learned from the past, even despite your dislike of being a Monday-morning quarterback, is that your predecessors accepted proposals which called for the assassination of a foreign chief of state, for one thing, and brought about the overturn of a government in Chile, for another thing.","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin, I am not going to pass judgment on whether there was an order or wasn't an order about assassination. I have said categorically this is an era that is past. I don't want to point a finger at any other [INTERVIEWED] or [INTERVIEWED]s.","I have looked at all of the material. We have given the material to the Church committee, and it is their obligation to, I think, analyze it but not do any finger-pointing.","Now, the CIA has two kinds of operations--one covert and the other overt. Their covert operations, under the procedures we have under this Administration, are carefully monitored--carefully monitored, and I can assure you that every one that is done is in the national interest of the United States.","MR. AGRONSKY. But your predecessors might well have thought the same thing. The concern is the use of the CIA covertly, if you like, as an instrument of policy and foreign policy by your predecessors.","[INTERVIEWED]. Martin, I think we have to understand we live in a real world. Every nation, either a friend or an adversary, has a comparable intelligence-gathering, intelligence-operating organization in their government. And they do it for their own national security. Now, the United States has to compete in this real world. It's a tough world, and our national security on many occasions involves doing things in a covert way.","I can only assure you that if and when we undertake them under this Administration, they will be carefully monitored and they will be directly related to the national security of this country. I am not going to pass judgment on what other [INTERVIEWED]s did. They were good men, whether they were Democrats or Republicans. They thought they were doing right. I can only pass judgment on what I want us to do, and those are the guidelines that we will follow.","CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE","[7.] [INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of national security and foreign policy, [INTERVIEWED]-and I must say parenthetically that you look very fit and relaxed for a man who just came back from Europe--nonetheless, your trip to Helsinki has encountered a substantial degree of hostility in this country, as you perhaps well know, and, rightly or wrongly, some people are suggesting that the Russians were the winners at Helsinki and we were the losers. What is your response to that criticism?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that is a completely inaccurate interpretation concerning the CSCE Conference in Helsinki. I think it is a judgment some people make, but I thoroughly disagree with it.","Let me just put this in perspective, if I might. We predicated many of the decisions involving borders on what? Peace treaties signed by all of the countries in the 1940's and in subsequent years. No border was agreed to in Helsinki that wasn't previously agreed to by previous American [INTERVIEWED]s or by previous governments in other countries.","We provided in that Helsinki agreement for peaceful change of borders. We made it far less likely that there will be military intervention by one country against another.","What we have really done is to make it possible for people in the East as well as in the West in Europe to communicate, to reestablish family relationships. We made it possible, if the agreement is lived up to. MR. AGRONSKY. If the agreement is lived up to?","[INTERVIEWED]. I will come to that in a minute, Martin.","We have made it possible for the news media to have greater freedom in all of the 35 countries.","Now, the question you ask is a very good one. Will the agreement be maintained? In my speech before the Conference, I said, on paper this is good. We have 2 years between now and the next meeting in 1977, and the test will be, have all 35 countries lived up to the agreement? It offers a hope. The reality will depend upon the execution.","I happen to believe that world pressure will force all countries, Communist countries and other countries, to live up to the agreement.","[INTERVIEWER]. But let's just take one example, [INTERVIEWED]. You talk about a peaceful change in borders being in the agreement. Now realistically speaking, do you think that the Russians would give up the Baltic territory, which they took over at the end of World War II? Do you think they would give up the Eastern European countries? Do you think that they would negotiate to give back these countries their independence?","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me put it the other way around. If we had not gone to Helsinki, do you think the Russians would have permitted any of the things you are talking about? In Helsinki, they at least signed an agreement that says you can change borders by peaceful means. [INTERVIEWER]. But does it mean anything, [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, they have signed something that says you can change borders by peaceful means. Prior to Helsinki, there was no such agreement.","MR. AGRONSKY. [INTERVIEWED], you used a very good phrase at Helsinki. You said \"Peace is not a piece of paper,\" a very memorable phrase, and it conveys this idea that we are talking about now. Many of your critics--and let's take it all of the way from Solzhenitsyn 1 to George Ball, a former Under Secretary of State-have voiced concern about legitimizing what, for example, George Ball calls the Soviet stolen empire, and asks, how do you reconcile that with Western ideals?","1Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.","The point Ball makes, the point Solzhenitsyn makes: that it is our obligation to follow policy that is more concerned with morality and principle than the acceptance of these borders would indicate.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, Martin, I go back to the peace treaties of Yalta and Paris and Potsdam and the agreement by the Germans themselves to establish those borders. Those were peace treaties that established borders for all of Eastern Europe and all of Western Europe. Those are factual things done in the forties, the fifties, et cetera.","The Conference on European Security and Cooperation didn't change any of those, but it did say--and every one of the nations did sign--something that is different, that there can be peaceful adjustments of borders.","[INTERVIEWER]. But despite what you are now saying, [INTERVIEWED], there is in this country, as you well know, a rising amount of criticism about detente itself, people questioning the value of detente. What is your feeling about this criticism, and do you think this is endangering detente?","[INTERVIEWED]. I hope it is not endangering detente because I think there are many pluses to us and, yes, to the Soviet Union. It has to be a two-way street.","I believe that SALT I was an outgrowth of detente. Does anybody want to tear up SALT I? I don't think so. Anything that puts a lid or a limitation on the development of nuclear weapons, the expansion of nuclear weapons--any agreement that puts a lid or controls, that is good. So, detente helped achieve SALT I.","Detente may help--I hope it will--SALT II, where we will put an actual cap on nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons systems.","MR. AGRONSKY. One of the happiest dividends that detente could possibly produce would be a reduction of forces by the Soviet Union as well as the Western allies in Western Europe.","[INTERVIEWED]. I agree.","MR. AGRONSKY. Was that raised at Helsinki? Did you get anywhere at all with that with Brezhnev?","[INTERVIEWED]. As you know, historically, when CSCE was originally agreed to as a program, it was also agreed to that there would be negotiations for mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe--MBFR. Those negotiations have been going on now for about 2 years. They are presently stalled, but now that we have the Helsinki agreement, it is my judgment that we have opened up encouraging prospects for additional movement in the MBFR negotiations.","I think the Allies and the West are getting together for perhaps a new position. I believe that the Soviet Union and its allies are taking a look at the current stalemated negotiations and may come up with some agreement. The prospects for a mutual and balanced force reduction in Europe have been enhanced by the Helsinki agreement--no question about that whatsoever.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, [INTERVIEWED], to go back to SALT I for a moment, you said at a recent news conference that according to your investigation the Russians had not cheated on the agreement limiting the use of certain strategic weapons. Your old friend, Melvin Laird, had written an article suggesting they had cheated. Since then, you have talked to Mr. Laird. Have you changed your mind about what you said earlier?","[INTERVIEWED]. I naturally investigated the allegations that were made by a number of people, including Mel. And after a thorough investigation, I have come to the conclusion that a person might legitimately make the charge there had been violations, but on complete and total investigation I think any person who knew the facts as I know them would agree that there had been no violations of any consequence.","There are some ambiguities--I want to be frank about it--but all of the responsible, knowledgeable people in the Pentagon or in any of the other responsible agencies would agree with me there have been no serious violations, and any that have been called to their attention have been Stopped. [INTERVIEWER]. But you are suggesting there have been some infractions, then?","[INTERVIEWED]. Very minor, but we have what we call a consultative group where if we think they are violating something, we make that point. It is investigated, and in the cases where there was any instance that might be an honest charge of a violation, they have been stopped.","The Soviet Union has raised some questions about certain activities that we have undertaken, and we have investigated them. And I think that arrangement of the consultative group has been very effective in making sure that SALT I was lived up to.","THE MIDDLE EAST","[8.] [INTERVIEWER]. Let me turn now to the Middle East, [INTERVIEWED]. MR. AGRONSKY. You beat me to it.","[INTERVIEWER]. We have had intensive negotiations going on now for about 2 months to try to get a peace treaty moving in this area. What is the prospect?","[INTERVIEWED]. They are better today than they were yesterday, and they are a lot better today than they were last March when the negotiations unfortunately broke off. [INTERVIEWER]. Does this mean you are increasingly optimistic?","[INTERVIEWED]. I am optimistic on an increasing basis, but I have learned that until it is signed in black and white that I shouldn't predict that it will be finalized. MR. AGRONSKY. Let me ask you---","[INTERVIEWER]. Pardon me, Martin. I want to just ask you one more question in this area. Do you find the Russians are now less troublesome in the Middle East in the efforts to achieve a peace agreement?","[INTERVIEWED]. They have acted in a very responsible way, during my time, in the Middle East. Let me just turn to the question of these negotiations that are going on between Israel on the one hand and Egypt on the other.","Both of those countries have to understand that flexibility at this crucial time is important for the peace of that area of the world and possibly peace in the world. Israel has to be more flexible; I think Egypt has to respond. If there isn't movement in the Middle East right now, the potential for war is increased significantly. And a war in the Middle East today has broader potential ramification than any time in the past, and we have had four wars in the Middle East since 1946 or 1947.","A fifth one not only means that Israel will be fighting the Arabs but the potential of a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union is a possibility.","MR. AGRONSKY. You must have raised that with Brezhnev. How did he react to it?","[INTERVIEWED]. We talked about the Middle East. We told them, or I told him, what we were doing. Secretary Kissinger had had a previous meeting with Foreign Minister Gromyko.","I repeat what I said a moment ago, Martin. The Soviet Union has acted in a very responsible way. I think they understand the potential consequences of no progress for continued peace and understanding in the Middle East.","[INTERVIEWER]. What do you see, sir, as our future policy toward South Vietnam? Do you think that we will recognize that Communist regime in the foreseeable future?","[INTERVIEWED]. Their current actions certainly do not convince me that we should recognize South Vietnam or North Vietnam.","[INTERVIEWER]. What about their application to get into the United Nations General Assembly?","[INTERVIEWED]. We have taken a very strong stand that we would not agree to the admission of South or North Vietnam unless and until South Korea is admitted. We believe in universality across the board. We don't believe in kicking nations out--kicking Israel out, for example. We think that would be bad policy.","MR. AGRONSKY. Did Mr. Brezhnev say he agreed with you on that--they were supporting that movement?","[INTERVIEWED]. We let it be known very, very strongly that we believe Israel should be permitted to be a member of the United Nations. That is our position. But on the other hand, we also believe that if you believe in universality, which includes South and North Vietnam, you have to have South Korea.","SECRETARY OF STATE KISSINGER","[9.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], when you first took office, you obviously relied a great deal upon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Do you now make more of the decisions on your own? Do you rely less upon Mr. Kissinger?","[INTERVIEWED]. I am not going to get into that discussion. Henry Kissinger and I have the closest possible rapport, personally and professionally. I see him every day for roughly an hour. We talk about the Middle East. We talk about SALT. We talk about our total foreign policy. It's a good relationship. It has been from the very first day. It is now, and I expect it to continue in the future. And I don't want to get into whether I do more or do less. We are a good team, and I think we have made some good decisions.","TURKEY","[10.] [INTERVIEWER]. Are you aware, [INTERVIEWED], of the criticism at the Capitol---","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure.","[INTERVIEWER]. ---from Republicans and not just Democrats, that in the Turkish aid fight, for example, that Mr. Kissinger was responsible for your losing that battle to lift the ban against military aid.","[INTERVIEWED]. I have heard those arguments but I don't think they are valid. I think the Congress, or the House of Representatives in this case, made the most serious wrong decision since I have been in Washington, which is 27 years. The Congress was totally wrong--or the House of Representatives. Why do I say that? First, they haven't solved the Cyprus problem. Number two, they have weakened NATO. Number three, because of the Turkish aid embargo, they have lessened our own national security capability by preventing us from using intelligence-gathering installations in Turkey. [INTERVIEWER]. Are you saying Congress is harming our foreign policy?","[INTERVIEWED]. There is no question about it. The decision of the House of Representatives to continue the Turkish arms embargo has seriously jeopardized our foreign policy and undercuts in a significant way our own national security, including that of NATO, and it hasn't solved--it has not solved the Cyprus problem.","MR. AGRONSKY. [INTERVIEWED], doesn't there have to be a concern for law? There was a law that said that aid that was given to Turkey could not be used as it was used against Cyprus.","[INTERVIEWED]. We have lived up to the law. We have stopped, because Congress told us to, the shipment of military hardware that the Turks bought and paid for. And incidentally, they bought and paid for the hardware, and because of Congressional action, the Turks are now being charged warehouse storage fees for equipment that they own that Congress said they couldn't get.","But anyhow, aside from that, which is, I think, a ridiculous development, we have lived up to the law. We are not sending them any military hardware, and unfortunately, the net result is what I told you.","But, Martin, I think you have to recollect a little bit. Who started the problem in Cyprus? It was the Greek Government, it was the previous Greek Government that tried to throw Makarios out and assassinate him, and the previous Greek Government wanted to move in with Greek troops and take over Cyprus. And as a result of Greek violations, the Turks moved in and have, unfortunately, dominated the situation. But the whole program or the whole problem arose by the unwise action of the previous Greek Government.","VICE [INTERVIEWED] ROCKEFELLER","[11.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], our time is almost out, and I must bring up a subject with which you are obviously quite familiar, namely, the rumors in this town that Nelson Rockefeller may not be your running mate in 1976. MR. AGRONSKY. That he is going to be dumped. [INTERVIEWER]. IS he going to be dumped? Is he going to be back on the ticket?","[INTERVIEWED]. I have read the various reports, and frankly, I think it is a tempest in a teapot. MR. AGRONSKY. That is what he said.","[INTERVIEWED]. I happen to agree with him. Nelson Rockefeller was selected by me because I think he would make and has made a first-class Vice [INTERVIEWED]. The realities of the political situation are I am going to go out with my campaign people to get my delegates. He, of course, will seek his delegates in the interim. I think the team of Ford and Rockefeller has done a good job, and at this time, I don't see any reason to change it.","MR. AGRONSKY. Is the position you take one that might finesse Mr. Reagan out of the picture, too?","[INTERVIEWED]. I only talk about the affirmative things, Martin. I don't want to get into who did this or who did that or what is going to happen. The realities are Nelson Rockefeller has done an excellent job as Vice [INTERVIEWED]. He works hard. He is cooperative. He has taken every job I have given him and done really a great job. When you have somebody that works on a team with you, why do you want to change?","• [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], on behalf of Martin and myself and all of us in Public Broadcasting, I would like to thank you for the privilege and the opportunity to come here and visit with you today. MR. AGRONSKY. With which I concur. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, Martin. Thank you, Paul. It has been very enjoyable."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpauldukewetatvthepresidentsrelationswithcongress","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you came to town, like Jimmy Carter, as an outsider, but the results have been vastly different. How do you explain your mastery of the legislative branch?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't know whether I'd have the nerve to use that word \"mastery\" as you did. But I had 8 years experience as Governor of California in which for about 7 of those 8 years both houses of the legislature were of the opposing party, and we managed to get a great many reforms in—the welfare reforms that were so tremendously successful, things of that kind. But I came here with the same idea, that we're coequal branches of the government.","They have got their problems, and it is a ease of common sense and consultation. And I've had 11 formal meetings with the leadership of the House and the Senate here. I've gone to the Hill 9 times myself, and I understand that for 18 months that's kind of a record.","[INTERVIEWER]. Senator Baker, the Republican leader, said that you have an instinctive feel for how the legislative branch works, and others who've come down to the White House say that you've also capitalized on your charm and your personality and your persistence. And I am wondering, did acting give you the training and the skills to sell your program to Congress?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I suppose we're all the sum total of everything that's happened to us and all the experiences we've had in our lives. So, whether that contributed something or not, I don't know.","I must say this about getting along with the Legislature. I am deeply indebted to Senator Howard Baker and to Representative Bob Michel, the Minority Leader in the House, for the great cooperation and the help that I've had from them, the masterful job they've done in those two positions that they hold as leader of the Senate and Minority Leader of the House.","Also, when I say \"consultation,\" I find that the job of keeping track of what's up there, of not pulling surprises, of letting them know—we have a group in the administration here that is appointed expressly for the purpose of legislative strategy, to keep track of our own proposals—and I try to remember that the [INTERVIEWED] proposes and the Congress disposes—to keep track of these things. If there is something that we feel we'd have trouble with and, perhaps, have to find ourselves in a veto position, we see that they're aware of that and what it is that puts us in that position in advance, and then keep in constant touch. And it doesn't hurt, every once in a while in keeping in touch, to say some \"thank you's.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, you go beyond that, though, [INTERVIEWED], because, when you talk to people on the Hill, there's a common refrain that comes through. They all say, we go down to the White House, and Ronald Reagan is a terribly charming man. Is there a politics of affability which has served you well? Is that a real skill in getting things done?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't know whether it's a skill or not, but I like people. And I certainly don't meet them with a chip on my shoulder. I think of it as the [INTERVIEWED] is the only one in town who's elected to represent all the people. Their problems are that, as Senators, they are elected, yes, to represent the people of this country, but, also, to have in mind the particular interests of their State and the problems of their State. A Representative, again, represents all the people, but also has specific things that he's responsible for with regard to his congressional district.","So, I know that. And I know that they, too, have problems. And these problems have to be reconciled. And sometimes it's going to weigh on them that something that they might be able to feel might have some benefit nationwide, but would be at a cost to their district or their State, that they can't support, and so you try to reconcile all of those viewpoints.","[INTERVIEWER]. And that's difficult, because we know that there's a great deal of hypocrisy which goes on at all times. I mean, we know that Members will get up on the floor, and they will do a great deal of grandstanding, and they'll talk about cutting Federal spending. And then they'll be running down to the White House or running to some of the agencies, demanding that \"no cuts be made in my tobacco subsidies or my sugar subsidies,\" or the dam project that you want for back home, additionally. How do you deal with all that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, again, as I say, it's one in which you—I can understand their responsibilities for those particular areas or projects of their district or State. And then I have to weigh that against the advantage or disadvantage for the whole country. And if it's one in which they must lose, that the national benefit outweighs the local benefit, then it's just a case of presenting that to them. And you'd be surprised how many times they recognize that the overall national good has to come first.","[INTERVIEWER]. So you see it, though, primarily as a matter of give and take on both sides, your side as well as their side. [INTERVIEWED]. Yeah.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I think one of the things which surprised us a great deal in Washington was that you turned out to be a far better politician than a lot of us thought you would be. And people will tell me that you have a gritty, competitive side to your personality. Do you enjoy the attack and counterattack that characterizes so much of the warfare between Capitol Hill and the White House?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I haven't thought of it as warfare. There is a kind of competitive thing to this. But in the last analysis, you have to come down on the side of what you feel inside is right, and then you do your utmost to convince someone who's in an adversary position at the time why you feel you're right and why you feel you must take the position that you do and have what you've asked for.","[INTERVIEWER]. But that's the motivating force as you see it. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. When you get into battles with Congress, obviously there's a matter of timing—when do you call Senator X who's been wavering; when do you make the practical compromise; how do you decide that? How involved do you yourself get in the legislative strategy of the White House?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I must be honest and confess that it would be impossible with all that's on my plate to know the timing of things of that kind. And so, there I depend on, again, this group in the White House to tell me, because—in other words, is something coming up in committee; is it coming to the floor; is this the time now; and that it's the best time to make the call before something comes to a vote. So, I depend on them for that.","[INTERVIEWER]. But do you feel that the experience you've gained as Governor of California, in dealing with the California Legislature, has enabled you to have this sense of timing, to know when to move, when to maneuver?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think from experience, yes, you have some of that. You could do it too soon—and memories are short-and it's worn off by the time the vote comes.","[INTERVIEWER]. But you also have to be constantly vigilant, always protecting your flanks, don't you? [INTERVIEWED]. Well, yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. It is not totally, 100-percent favorable from the Hill standpoint, [INTERVIEWED]. While everybody does talk about your affability and the fact that they come down—they love to come down to see you, and they love the stories which you spin-you also get another side from some Members who say that you're not always strong on substance, that sometimes you're out of touch, and that sometimes you have too simplistic a view of things. How do you see yourself?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I know there are criticisms of that kind. I don't particularly admit that the criticisms are justified. I think now and then to use an anecdote saves a lot of words sometimes to be able to tell something that illustrates what it is we're trying to do. If you have some example, for example, of bureaucratic dillydallying or repetitive things that aren't needed and you can tell that example, it saves several paragraphs of just trying to reason with someone in explaining what it is that you're trying to correct.","And I find, though, it's not only that you come down at the moment of consultation-for example, something to do with foreign policy right now and the act that requires consultation with the Congress with regard to—well, my announcement recently of saying that in principle, if it was essential to bring peace to the Middle East and to Lebanon, the use of American troops in a multinational force. But the other day, I didn't wait—they hadn't been invited, so there is nothing to go to the Congress about—but since the word was out and was in the press and had been leaked that this had happened, I had a very fine meeting with the leadership of the Congress on this in explaining exactly where we were and so forth, in advance, a totally informal meeting that would precede, if the need arises, when I must go to them formally. And I understand that some of them from both parties went out and said it was one of the best meetings of that kind they'd ever had.","[INTERVIEWER]. But would you concede, [INTERVIEWED], by nature that you are the kind of political leader who sees the broad, general picture and is not that interested in the specifics or the detail of a lot of legislative matters?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I think I brought that from the experience in California, that I know the importance of the detail. My job, of course, is to sell—if there is a dispute there—is to sell the overall goal that we're trying to achieve. And so I center on that.","[INTERVIEWER]. There are also complaints about the administration's managerial style, [INTERVIEWED]. In talking with many Republicans at the Capitol in recent days, I find a common thread running through what they say. Most of them say we don't have that much quarrel with the [INTERVIEWED] himself, but they do say that your agents and the administration's representatives on the Hill frequently are too arrogant, that they don't return phone calls, that they don't pay attention to the advice given from Capitol Hill, that they're insensitive to the political needs of Members of Congress. Are you aware of that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think it's true. I think anyone can find some incident or some oversight or something and complain about it. But I have to again say that I became accustomed in the 8 years in California, and already here, that there is a tendency to invent a palace guard and pretend that the [INTERVIEWED] is being protected from the palace guard, and therefore is not aware of these things. I know that in the hectic pace that now and then something can slip by. I have not heard anyone—if there is anyone on our side that's being arrogant, I certainly want to know about it. But I don't know of anyone that is, and I have not had that complaint come to me.","Now, I get the summary of all of the mail also, and it's a considerable reading problem, the congressional mail. And so that isn't ignored. And I see all those letters that are written—and some with an individual or particular problem or some with a group of Representatives or Senators—that's all put on my desk.","[INTERVIEWER]. So, you don't feel that the ship may be run a little too loosely, that perhaps you've delegated too much authority? [INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], there's also the matter of comity between the legislative and the executive branches—the bond of respect. And some of the Republicans at the Hill say there is a problem in that they will negotiate deals with the Democrats, and then White House officials and others will come along and undermine those deals. And this makes it much more difficult, that it affects their credibility at the Capitol.","[INTERVIEWED]. That, I think, is a part of the whole process that goes on. Let's take the economic program a year ago in the combination of the tax program and the budget reductions. We didn't get all we wanted, and we had to—in addition to not getting everything we asked for, we also had to take some things that we hadn't asked for. Now, that's a case of in the give and take in the legislature, of what they can get. Well, then, still I'm a party to that also, and I have to speak up, or my representatives, if there is a price that we feel is too high. I can't accept something that is totally contrary to the principle that we're trying to obtain in that program.","And the same was true of this most recent budget bill. That was not the bill that I would have submitted—and there were seven versions on the floor at one time, most of which were unacceptable, because they wouldn't do the job, and they wouldn't come close to the goal we're trying to achieve. But they did evolve one that I could call back and say, yes, this one I support.","Now, I'm sure that someone, say, on our side who has negotiated something and been willing to give to get something in there, can be a little irked if I don't agree that he was paying the right price.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you've started to veto some of these bills now. Can we expect a lot more vetos in coming weeks and months?","[INTERVIEWED]. If they're budget-busters, yes. I said that. They've passed a resolution, a budget resolution. I realize that that must be followed by appropriation bills. If they ignore the ceilings that have been put in the budget resolution, which they can do, send an appropriation that would, if passed, have the budget go way beyond the bounds that were set, then I have to veto it.","[INTERVIEWER]. We're also into an election campaign, and it may be a tough year for the Republicans. Some of the polls indicate that. If the Democrats, for example, pick up 10, 20, or 30 seats in the House of Representatives, what happens to your conservative majority? How will that affect your program?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well—in the House, you say? [INTERVIEWER]. In the House.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, if they only pick up 10, then we've won a great victory, because if you look back in history, the first off-year election the party that is out of power in the White House normally picks up about 40 seats. That's just been traditional. And so you start from behind with this bielection that is coming up. And I'm just—I'd like to pick up some more. I'd like to have more Representatives in there than we have. But I understand I would be bucking tradition and history. So, when you use that figure 10, that would be only about a fourth as many as traditionally you're supposed to lose.","[INTERVIEWER]. Tip O'Neill—you and Tip O'Neill have mixed it up a bit. He says he likes the Irish side of you, that he wishes you were a little more Irish and a little less Republican.","[INTERVIEWED]. [Laughing] I'll tell you, Tip and I, we get along fine. There's nothing personal in our contest. And, actually, there's nothing really political. It is philosophical. Tip really and sincerely and honestly believes in the philosophy—which I once believed in and found I could no longer follow—of taxing and spending and government trying to do things that I think are beyond government's proper province. And he sincerely believes that. So, it's a battle of philosophies between us. But, as Tip said, come 6 o'clock, we're friends. [INTERVIEWER]. And you're still friends? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], as you sit here every day grappling with the affairs of state, do you ever wish that you had run for the Senate from California as you once considered? Do you ever wish that you were up there instead of being here?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I never considered running for the Senate. I was asked once to run for the Congress when I was a Democrat and—by fellow party members—and said, no, I liked the career I had. I never in my life intended or believed that I would ever have a desire to run for office. And it was in 1965, after the 1964 election, when our party in California was badly shattered, that people began pressing me to run for the Governorship. And it got to the place that neither Nancy or I could sleep. They kept emphasizing that they felt that this was the only way that we could pull the party together and that I could win.","And I have to confess something. I honestly believe that when I finally gave in, very reluctantly, and said yes, I really hadn't thought beyond winning the election. And it dawned on me after I'd said yes that if I won the election, I was going to have a job for several years.","No, I was never tempted to seek a legislative position, certainly not after serving as Governor.","[INTERVIEWER]. Anyway, you prefer being [INTERVIEWED] to being a Senator. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. I want to thank you very much for the visit here, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's been my pleasure."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpetermaermutualnbcradio","text":["Meeting With Soviet [INTERVIEWED] Gorbachev","[INTERVIEWER]. Good morning, [INTERVIEWED]. We're very pleased to have this opportunity for this first radio interview with you. Some foreign policy questions, if I may, to start off. What will be item number one on the table when you sit down with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Malta?","[INTERVIEWED]. To be sure that we are not operating in a way that there will be unnecessary misunderstanding. In other words, I use the analogy of two big ships passing in the night: I don't want that to happen. I want to be on the same wavelength as much as we can. So, I would say the meeting is designed to see that the two ships do not pass in the night for lack of light.","[INTERVIEWER]. But what specifically will you bring up first?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as I say, we have not ever set an agenda. Clearly, I will be interested in getting his views on the dynamic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. We will have detailed conversations about his economy, and I will be glad to talk to him about ours. And so, I think along those two areas you'll see a lot of discussion. And also, I will be bringing up, and I expect he will be prepared to discuss, regional tensions: problems in this hemisphere, support for Nicaragua, for example; Afghanistan; other areas where Soviet interest and the United States do not parallel each other.","[INTERVIEWER]. You sent him a message in reply to his earlier cable, again saying that you support the reforms going on in his country and in Eastern Europe. Do you support them to the extent that you'd put your money where your mouth is, so to speak, and grant the Soviets some sort of economic assistance to spur those reforms?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm perfectly prepared to discuss economic reforms and what the Soviets would like to see in terms of interest from the West. But I noted with great interest Mr. Shevardnadze's [Foreign Minister] view when asked a similar question. He said: \"We're not looking for aid. We are not wanting somebody to bail us out.\" That's good. They're a sovereign state, have a high degree of pride -- but clearly, there will be a discussion of economic matters as they affect the Soviet Union.","[INTERVIEWER]. When you say, as you did in a speech this week, that the Malta summit -- the Malta meeting, as you all here prefer to call it -- will not be used to negotiate the future of Europe, what does that mean? Are you taking something off the table there?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. What I'm saying is we're not going to have a Yalta.","[INTERVIEWER]. To what extent? When you're not -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. To the extent that it's not the role of the United States of America and the Soviet Union to divide up things or alter borders or do some of the things that took place at the meeting I've just referred to. We're not going to get into that. It is a broad, general meeting -- we wouldn't do it anyway.","General Noriega of Panama","[INTERVIEWER]. Another part of the world. Have you, indeed, approved a covert plan that allows the CIA to recruit people to overthrow Manuel Noriega in Panama?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course I'd love to see Noriega out there, but you know I never discuss intelligence. I was head of the intelligence community for 1 year, a little over a year -- about a year -- and one thing that I know you don't do is discuss covert action or rumors about covert action, or confirm or deny covert action. And I wish other people would conduct themselves in that same manner, and then maybe some of the efforts of an intelligence community could be more effective. So, I will not confirm or deny anything of that nature.","Now, if you'd like me to state would we like to see Noriega out of office -- absolutely.","[INTERVIEWER]. I know you want him out of office. How far will you go to get him out?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that is a question that's so open-ended it can't possibly be answered.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, let me ask you this. Since you won't answer that and you won't talk about the specific plan, do you still feel that your hands are tied?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not saying there is a specific plan.","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay. Since you won't even confirm whether there is a specific plan -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Now we're going, now we're talking. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. -- -- do you still feel your hands are tied by Congress on matters like this? This matter specifically?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, not on this matter specifically, and if there were to be a plan -- and I think we have a pretty good understanding with the Intelligence Committee at this point, in the Senate and in the House.","German Reunification","[INTERVIEWER]. Back to Eastern Europe. Is reunification of the two Germanys -- is that inevitable?","[INTERVIEWED]. I gave my view on that, and I said that that was a matter for the people of the Germanys to determine. And it's a highly sensitive matter as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, and it's better to leave it right there.","[INTERVIEWER]. But when you look at the way events are going there, is it inevitable in your opinion?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that's very hypothetical because there are so many things that can intervene. And I would say it is a matter for the determination of the German people.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, many people look at the history books, and they worry about that prospect. Is that a legitimate concern?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we've had discussions with countries that express concerns in this regard because of certain historical precedents, but I don't think that history need repeat itself if there evolves a single German State. But that is down the road, and it is not something that is being pressed. And I repeat: That is a matter for the determination of the German people.","Defense Budget Cuts","[INTERVIEWER]. Some Members of Congress look at this situation in Europe, and they see it as ripe for debate on considering cutting the defense budget, taking a big chunk out of it. Does that make sense to you?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, it doesn't make sense to me.","Military Reductions in Europe","[INTERVIEWER]. What about reducing NATO and Warsaw Pact forces there? A lot of people think -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. We already have made proposals. We have a bold proposal, a leadership proposal by the United States that has wide support amongst our allies, to do exactly that.","[INTERVIEWER]. Will that be on the table in Malta?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's on the table now.","[INTERVIEWER]. If Gorbachev comes in, and he says why don't we agree to it here? -- a lot of experts think that he will come in and say that.","[INTERVIEWED]. He's already agreed to it in principle. The Soviet Union has -- there's no great debate on the principles of the reductions that we've proposed. But the problem is we're hammering out a lot of detail now that can't be done at a Malta meeting or that has to be done in a multilateral forum.","And so, I've been very pleased that the Soviets have been quite supportive of this United States-NATO initiative.","[INTERVIEWER]. Would you be willing to use the Malta meeting as a setting to sign off on such an agreement once -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't want to elevate the expectations of a watching world. That is not going to take place at Malta because the details have not been worked out in the multilateral forum where they're being discussed in Vienna. It just won't be ready by then.","[INTERVIEWER]. Quick domestic question -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. My hope is that it can meet the timetables I set and the alliance set. And they were very ambitious. But it's not December 2d.","Abortion","[INTERVIEWER]. Quick domestic question. Will you sign this DC appropriations bill that includes allowing the use of local funds for abortions for poor women?","[INTERVIEWED]. I have made very clear that I -- they can test me all they want; they can package it any way they want, but if it expands the use of federally appropriated funds for abortion, I'm not going to sign it. And I've been very honest and direct with the District.","[INTERVIEWER]. This is local funds.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me see what it is then, if there's something different. But if it's appropriated federally, why, I have great difficulty with that, and have been very open with the Congress on it.","[INTERVIEWER]. This is still a very painful subject for you, isn't it?","[INTERVIEWED]. It is, I don't like it. I know that our party is big enough to have people in it who differ on this question. There's no question about that. If that weren't true, I guess I wouldn't have been elected [INTERVIEWED], because this issue was widely presented to the American people and very openly debated in debates with Mr. Dukakis, who felt quite differently about it.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, if the party is big enough, why is it that policymakers in the health area are required to share your views before they're -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Because I was elected to perform on certain things. They don't have to share them on every iota -- crossing every \"t\" and dotting every \"i\" -- but I'm [INTERVIEWED]. I was elected to do certain things. And I want somebody in housing that can support the general initiative on housing. I want people on health that share my respect for human life. I want people in Treasury that like to see this deficit come down in a certain way. That's not such a radical concept.","The [INTERVIEWED]'s Dog","[INTERVIEWER]. They tell me the time is up. I have to ask ÿ7Eÿ7Eone ÿ7Eÿ7Ekicker. ÿ7Eÿ7ECan ÿ7Eÿ7Eyou ÿ7Eÿ7Econfirm ÿ7Eÿ7Ethese widespread White House stories that your dog has been eating rats and squirrels?","[INTERVIEWED]. She's doing her part. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. Has she been eating rats and squirrels?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not eating them.","[INTERVIEWER]. Just killing them.","[INTERVIEWED]. Our dog is a fearless hunter, and what she does on her own time -- that's her business.","[INTERVIEWER]. What does it tell us -- that there are rats in the White House yard here?","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I just want to keep them out of the swimming pool. One jumped in there when Barbara was swimming. And we're relying heavily on Millie to cut that down.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you very much.","[INTERVIEWED]. There was a mouse in this very room you're sitting in. I hope that doesn't terrify you, but he was done in the other day, too.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much for joining us, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]. Not at all."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithphiladlerkrldradiodallastexas","text":["[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], are you there?","[INTERVIEWED]. I am, Phil.","Economic Program","[INTERVIEWER]. Good morning to you. We think that a lot of people responded to a theme, or at least I think so, in the [INTERVIEWED]ial campaign of sacrifice to cut the deficit as long as that sacrifice is equal. The Btu tax was designed originally on the concept of equal sacrifice. But then all of these exceptions were added, and it really makes it appear that it's one of the most complicated proposals ever. Did you make a mistake allowing all the special exceptions to be included in the Btu tax?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I didn't allow them all to be included. Some of them were included in the House of Representatives bill, and I didn't agree with all of them. But let me say what I think was a good criticism of the tax and that is that we wanted the tax to restrain energy consumption in ways that promoted energy conservation and also supported fuel switching to more environmentally beneficial and more available natural gas. That bill, as drawn, would be a big boon to the natural gas industry in Texas and Oklahoma and throughout the United States. And that's one of the things we were trying to do. Now, some of the oil companies didn't like it, but the people that were in the gas business liked it. We had a big Texas gas company, headed by a person who strongly supported [INTERVIEWED] Bush in the last election, endorsed the economic program. ARCO and Sun Oil both endorsed the economic program, including the Btu tax.","So Secretary Bentsen, who, as you know, has represented you in the Senate for a long time, offered the Senate a modified Btu tax which, instead of having all those particular exemptions, would basically have alleviated the burden of the Btu tax on industry and agriculture on the production sector but still given them an incentive to move toward natural gas wherever possible and would also have cut the Btu rate and would have replaced that with more spending cuts.","From my point of view, unfortunately, we couldn't pass that through the committee because Senator Boren had said he wouldn't vote for any tax based on the heat content of fuel. But I still think it was a good concept, and it will be interesting to see what happens if the Senate's version of the economic plan passes, to see what happens in the conference and what we come up with.","[INTERVIEWER]. What we have now is a gasoline tax that's been passed by the Senate committee, and you've called that regressive in the past. How can you sell that, if you have to, to House Members who did risk some political capital by supporting you on the Btu tax?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think anything that comes out has to be a combination of agreement between the House and the Senate. It's hard to get 218 House Members and 51 Senators to agree on anything that's tough. I mean, everybody can talk about cutting the deficit, but it's one thing to talk about it and quite another to do. But I think they'll be able to do it. No one was particularly happy with the form of the Btu tax, or very few people were, that passed the House, but everybody thought that Secretary Bentsen could come up with a plan that would make it good for the economy and could achieve what we were trying to do in terms of promoting domestic energy, and I think he did. The Senate preferred a tax that was a gas tax and a tax on some other fuels. It, at least, is small enough so that it is not particularly unfair to people in rural areas. It's not as big as what some had wanted, and certainly I did not want just a big old gas tax. I thought that was unfair.","I also think it's important to point out in Texas, in light of the rhetoric in the recent political campaign, that it is simply not true that there is no spending cuts in this plan. There's $250 billion in spending cuts, and they affect everything. They affect agriculture and veterans and Medicare and the whole range of discretionary spending of the Government. They affect foreign aid; they affect defense. There are sweeping, broad-based spending cuts in this program. And the tax increases, two-thirds of them, fall on people with incomes above $200,000, three-quarters on people with incomes above $100,000. Families of four with incomes below $30,000 are held harmless, and people who work for a living 40 hours a week and have kids in the house who are now in poverty would actually be lifted above poverty by these tax changes in ways that promote the movement from welfare to work. So this is a fair and balanced plan.","It was developed, and in a very aggressive way, by Lloyd Bentsen and by Leon Panetta, who used to be chairman of the House Budget Committee, to be fair, to have equal spending cuts in taxes, and to drive the deficit down so we could bring interest rates down. That's good for Texas, and that's good for everybody in America. And also, it leaves some room for investments that are critical to our future. And as you know, I support—you were implying this before I got on—I support the space station and the super collider projects because I think they're good for America's future. And if you're going to spend money on those things, you have to spend money on them. You can't play games; they do cost some money.","Space Station and Super Collider","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], how long can you guarantee that support for the super collider and the space station? Will they fall if that's the only way to meet your overall deficit reduction goal?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, my overall deficit reduction goals can be met in my plan with the space station and the super collider. I do want to emphasize that we've already shaved $4 billion off the 5-year budget for the space station and some money off the 5-year budget for the super collider by redesigning the space station, based on a team of exceptional national experts who analyzed the project and recommended that it be redesigned and also that NASA's management be changed rather dramatically. And we just delayed the implementation schedule on the super collider some, so that none of the opponents of the space station and the super collider could claim that there had been no spending cut there.","So we have done that. But I strongly feel it would be a mistake to abandon those. Now, I would be less than candid if I didn't tell you that there are a lot of people in other parts of the country who want to cut those projects. There was always a lot of opposition to them, and because of the last election and all of the rhetoric and all the claims in Texas that there were no spending cuts in this budget, that has given real energy to the opponents of the space station and the super collider. It wasn't true that there were no spending cuts, but there are a lot of people up there who have been wanting to kill these projects for years who are just gleeful at the way the rhetoric in the last election played out in Texas. They think that they have been given a license by the people of Texas to kill the space station and the super collider. And it's going to be very much harder for me to keep them alive. But I'm doing the best I can.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I'm informed that our time has run out, by one of your aides, I believe. Good to talk with you this morning.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you. I enjoyed it."]}

[INTERVIEWED], thank you for selecting Phoenix Television for this interview. What greeting and message would you like to convey to the Chinese people prior to your visit to China?","[INTERVIEWED]. First, that the relationship between China and America is an important relationship. It's a mixed relationship. There is a lot of good that we're doing together, and there's a lot of areas where we may not have full agreement but, nevertheless, are able to discuss our disagreements in a very cordial way. And so I would tell the people of China you live in a great, massive country that's growing well and that we want to have good relations with you.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to China","[INTERVIEWER 2]. This will be your third formal visit to China.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. What do you hope to achieve with this visit?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the visit is giving me a chance to further get to know the leadership. [INTERVIEWED] Hu is a person who I enjoy visiting with. He is a smart fellow. And the more you get to know a person, the better—the easier it is to make good policy.","Secondly, I'm going to, of course, be going to China to represent the interests of my people. I'll talk about the need for trade that is free and fair. I'll talk about the currency, of course. I'll talk about intellectual property rights that the [INTERVIEWED] and I have discussed before.","And then on the international front we'll, of course—I'll confirm my \"one China,\" three-communique policy, that not only says that we do not support independence but as well, we will adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act. I think that's important for the Chinese leadership and the people of China to hear.","We've also got an agenda to fight terrorism, fight narcotrafficking, as well as to work together to convince the leader of North Korea that the Korean Peninsula should be nuclear weapons-free.","So we've got a broad agenda.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. Keep you busy.","[INTERVIEWED]. It will keep us busy, but it's an important agenda, and the people of China must understand that when the United States and China works together, we can accomplish a lot.","Taiwan","[INTERVIEWER 2]. You brought up Taiwan. I remember in 2001 and 2003 you made strong statements regarding Taiwan——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. ——and regarding the recent development, do you feel less concern about a cross-strait situation than you were in, like, 2003?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm always concerned that one party or the other will do something unilaterally to change the status quo, which would then create, you know, a source of angst and anger. And therefore, I'm constantly reiterating my position so that both sides clearly know the position of the United States.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. Are you optimistic about a peaceful resolution in the end?","[INTERVIEWED]. I have seen some—yes, I am optimistic there will be a peaceful resolution. Secondly, I am optimistic because I have seen cross-straits discussion starting to take place. And I urge the parties to continue those discussions. I believe it is possible, through discussion and good will, to end up solving this issue in a peaceful way.","China-U.S. Relations","[INTERVIEWER 2]. You call U.S.-China relationship complicated.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. And we heard U.S. officials and experts have variously called China a threat, a partner, a competitor, and an opportunity. So how do you see China, and what's your plan to deal with China's emergence?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that's interesting— all the different adjectives I guess kind of express a complicated relationship. I would say—I think we've got a lot of issues to deal with, is the best way to describe it. And on issues on which we agree, we can make positive contributions and change.","Issues we don't necessarily agree on, we can work through and do so in a frank way. And I repeat, I think we have a fantastic opportunity by working with China and other countries to make sure that the Korean Peninsula is nuclear weapons-free, which will lay a foundation for a peace in the region and the hemisphere, and that's important.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. You brought up North Korea. What other issues do you most seek China's support and cooperation? And what do you expect them to do?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, on the United Nations Security Council we work on every issue together. And one way for us to be able to work together is just to share opinions on different issues. For example, I'll bring up Iran. I want the [INTERVIEWED] to understand how I think it's important for the free world and the peaceful world to work together to convince the Iranians not to develop a nuclear weapon.","China has got influence. China is a big, powerful nation. And therefore, it's in our interest that we share ideas and work together. I'll also want to continue discussions on the economic front, because we've got a big trade imbalance with China, but we're making progress. The Chinese took a good first step on having a market currency; I believe they ought to do more. The [INTERVIEWED] made a very strong statement in New York about intellectual property rights. We've reached a textile agreement, which is a very important signal to our folks who want to make sure that the [INTERVIEWED] works for fair trade. And with the trade balance as big as it is, you know, it's important for people here in America to be able to say to themselves, \"We hope it's fair.\" And I'm going to continue to insist on fair trade as well.","Finally, there is a couple of other areas we can work on, if you've got a second. One is energy. We consume a lot of energy. China is consuming more energy. And we need to share information and share technologies so both of us can diversify away from hydrocarbons.","[INTERVIEWED]'s 1975 Visit to China","[INTERVIEWER 2]. My last question, in 1975 you visited China, when your father was U.S. Representative in Beijing.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I did.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. I know you spent your 29th birthday there——","[INTERVIEWED]. That's right. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER 2]. ——and went back a number of visit over the years. Can you share with us some of the memories that made the deepest impression on you when you think of China?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think of how different China is today than it was in 1975. In 1975—first of all, I had a fantastic experience when I went there in 1975.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. Good to know.","[INTERVIEWED]. I really did. It was great. It was really interesting. The two impressions—a couple of impressions. One, everybody was on bicycles; there weren't many automobiles. I happened to be one of the people on bicycles. I rode all over the place in Beijing, which was fascinating.","Secondly, I can remember how odd people thought I looked. In other words, there wasn't much exposure to the West, and all of a sudden an American starts riding a bike amongst them, and it, frankly, surprised some people.","And thirdly, I noticed there was uniformity in dress. People wore the same style clothes. And that's changed, which means there's a market; people are beginning to express their own individual desires and somebody is meeting those desires with a product. There's high-rise buildings that are magnificent. When I went to Shanghai right after September the 11th, 2001, I was—it was mind-boggling to look at the fantastic buildings that had been built between the airport and the old town.","So this is a country that has progressed a lot since 1975, which shows the vast potential of China. And it explains to people—it should explain to people in America why it's important for our Government to have a good working relationship—as complex as it is, but to have a good working relationship. And we do. And that's in the interest not only of our respective people but it's in the interest of the world.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks for coming.","[INTERVIEWER 2]. I wish you a very good trip to Asia and a successful visit to China.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much."]}

I'd love to do popular vote, it would be such a thing. I would love to do a popular vote, but it's a much different kind of a contest. I think it would be actually an easier way of doing it, but the electoral college is nice because it gets you into so many different states that you wouldn't see otherwise. But we had a great campaign and we won, and the country is doing fantastically well.","[INTERVIEWER]: Some people think you didn't actually want to win.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, that's such a false story. That's fake news, that was in that fake book. But that is such a false story. I mean first of all, you know me, and I actually though I was going to win because I'd go to stadiums and we'd have 25,000, 30,000 people in the stadiums. We would have a fever pitch, it was incredible what was happening that last two months of the campaign. And coming into the last month I thought we were going to win. We were getting massive crowds. My opponent was not getting good crowds at all. She was getting, you know, singers and entertainers to fill up the stadiums. They'd finish singing and then everybody would leave and she was left there. So I'm telling you, I really thought I was going to win, and I very much wanted to win. If I didn't win I would have been very disappointed.","[INTERVIEWER]: You've had an extraordinary year. Whether people love you or loathe you, it's been extraordinarily eventful. Depending on who you talk to, you're either delivering on a lot of your promises, beginning to make America great as you vowed, or, and you know the other half of this, you're a raging tweeting wrecking ball who's destroying the country and terrifying the entire planet. How do you plead?","[INTERVIEWED]: I plead not guilty.","[INTERVIEWER]: To all of it? Or the second bit?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think I shakes things up. It had to be shaken up. The country had to be shaken up. We're doing incredibly on an economic basis. Financial – stock market just hit another new high. We've had 84 – since the election – 84 new market highs. Think of that. It's incredible. It's never happened before. It's a record. That in itself is a record. During the course of a little more than a year we've had – think of it – 84 stock market records. It's going to go higher. Regulation – nobody's done anywhere near like I've done. That's also a record, a world record for [INTERVIEWED]s. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill – not easy to get. Many people have tried to do it, they weren't able to do it, and this is the biggest one we've ever passed, bigger than the Reagan bill. And it's had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. And people...","[INTERVIEWER]: How significant was the Apple move?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I thought it was great, but that was one move. They're going to invest $350 billion, they're going to build plants all over the place, they're going to build a college, they're going to build this incredible campus. They are fantastic. So it's a $350 billion investment, which I guess is probably the largest – or certainly right up there – largest ever made by a company. So we're doing very well, people are coming back into the country in droves. One thing very exciting to me is Chrysler – they're leaving Mexico and they're going back to Michigan. You haven't heard that in a long time. We're doing things that nobody thought possible and the country is becoming very very strong again economically. Unemployment is at record lows. Women unemployment – 17 years. Think of it, 17 years. Black unemployment – the best record in history, the history of our country. African American unemployment, best. Hispanic unemployment, best in the history of the country. All of the things that I said on the campaign trail coming true, so I'm very happy about it.","[INTERVIEWER]: A lot of people will listen to that – a lot of people don't want to give you any credit – but a lot of that is indisputable. The economy is in good shape. The global economy is in good shape.","[INTERVIEWED]: And that's been taking... a lot of the global economy Piers is because of how well we're doing. Most people won't admit that, but we are doing well, that's helping all around the globe. That's a very good thing.","[INTERVIEWER]: Your supporters get frustrated that a lot of the tweeting – the tweetstorms, the controversies, some of the more outlandish things that you occasionally say – that they distract from that kind positive message. Do you accept that? Do you care?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't think it's so many of my supporters. I think a lot of other people, they use that... I don't call it tweeting, I call it social media. And you're a big social media man by the way. you do great with it. And I think you might agree with that statement.","[INTERVIEWER]: I like your tweets. I like the kind of unfettered access to [INTERVIEWED]'s mind in real time.","[INTERVIEWED]: If I wasn't able to do that – I call it a modern day form of communication, OK – if I wasn't able to do that, because I get a lot of fake news, I get a lot of news that's very false, very made up. You saw all of the stories that were wrong this year. I mean one of the stories was so wrong it drove the stock market down substantially and it was wrong. They've made a lot of mistakes and lot of them were made on purpose. If I don't have that form of communication, I can't defend myself. Unless I'm going to have a news conference every 15 minutes...","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you actually tweet yourself?","[INTERVIEWED]: I do. I do. I also give it to people and sometimes I'll have – I had one case where a lawyer did a tweet, you know they'd call it. I have a man, Dan Scavino, and I have people that are with me, you know Hope [Hicks] and you know Sarah [Huckabee Sanders]...","[INTERVIEWER]: The whole world waits for you to wake up, on tenterhooks.","[INTERVIEWED]: ...It's a crazy situation.","[INTERVIEWER]: Are you actually lying in bed with your phone working out how to wind everybody up?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever. But generally speaking during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that, but I'm very busy during the day – very long hours, I'm busy – and sometimes I'll just dictate out something really quickly and they'll give it to one of my people to put it up.","[INTERVIEWER]: There's been a few big events in the last week, one of which was the big Women's March on the first anniversary of your inauguration. The #MeToo and the Time's Up campaigns have really resonated with millions of women. And they partly hold you to blame for a lot of attitude towards women. Do you have a message for them? Because we're a year on from the last time there were all these marches, a lot is happening in that area of sexual harassment and you've seen what's happened in Hollywood and so on. What message could you give these women who are marching that you're for them and not the problem?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I am for them and I think a lot of them understand that. You know, I won many categories of women and the women vote in the election, and people were shocked to see it. I was running against a woman and I'm winning all of these categories. You know that better than anybody. And I think I would do even better right now... In fact we've just had polls coming out just a little while ago, just before I walked into the room that are really up tremendously. I think that's maybe because of the economy, but I just said before that women have the best unemployment numbers that they've had in 17 years. And they're doing tremendously in business, they're doing tremendously in so many ways, and people are starting to see that. Now, you're always going to have marches, and I guess the march was a lot smaller than it was last year...","[INTERVIEWER]: But do you agree with their basic principles, which are gender equality and safety. When it comes to safety, women want to feel safe, particularly in the work place. Do you sign up to that?","[INTERVIEWED]: I do, but I also think they want to feel safe at the border. I think they don't want people pouring into their country. I think they want to see our military get much stronger. I mean women, you know, families, they want to see strength at the border. They want to see a strong law enforcement. I'm a very much law and order person and candidate when I ran. The uniformed services, the military – there's nobody better than me on the military. I've increased the budget, we're going to have a budget, $700 billion this year. The Democrats were not going to have anywhere near that. I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home in many different respects...","[INTERVIEWER]: A lot of the women I spoke to about this, they said it would be great to hear [INTERVIEWED], given some of the more disrespectful things that have been out there, and the way you've spoken about women, would you acknowledge that you had said things that perhaps you wouldn't say now? That you have also listened – as many men are listening right now – that you've changed, you've changed as a man?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well I think we have to evolve. If we don't evolve, there's something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women, and I think you know that very well because you know me, and you've spent a long period of time with me. You see all of the women I have working around me and working with me. Tremendous respect for women.","[INTERVIEWER]: You have a lot of strong women around you. Melania, and your team here, the press team. Do you identify as a feminist? Are you a feminist?","[INTERVIEWED]: No, I wouldn't say I'm a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I'm for women, I'm for men, I'm for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it and they have to win... And women are doing great. And I'm happy about that.","[INTERVIEWER]: Move to Britain. A lot of stuff has been going on between you and my country, which has been...","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it's good. I think I'm very popular in your country.","[INTERVIEWER]: Let's not be too hasty [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]: But I believe that, I really do. I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I'm saying about many different things. I have a great... I own the great Turnberry and other things in your country – Turnberry in Scotland – and I'm getting tremendous – I mean we get tremendous support from people in the UK.","[INTERVIEWER]: But there are a lot of politicians, mainly the opposition politicians – Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Leader, Sadiq Khan, London Mayor...","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't know the man, I don't know the man.","[INTERVIEWER]: They want you banned. They don't want you to come on any kind of visit, a normal visit, state visit, anything.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, that's their problem. I mean, if they don't, I could very nicely stay home. But I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister, who I just left. And I think she's been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don't. I support her. I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. I mean, we will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. But I am a tremendous supporter of the UK. Tremendous supporter. There's nobody that believes more strongly.","[INTERVIEWER]: You're half-British right?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, my mother was born in Scotland, in the Hebrides.","[INTERVIEWER]: That makes you half-British.","[INTERVIEWED]: My mother was born in Stornoway. You know what they call that? Serious Scotland, right? That's serious Scotland. She was born in Stornoway.","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you feel half-British?","[INTERVIEWED]: I sort of do. I love the country. I'm in Aberdeen with a tremendous... I also have a great situation over in Ireland in Doonbeg over there. And of course Turnberry... that's the Mona Lisa, one of the great Mona Lisas of the world in terms of sport and golf, and I own Turnberry. And I love the UK. I have a special – maybe because it's my mother, who I thought was one of the great people I've ever known...","[INTERVIEWER]: What would she have made of what's happened to you, your mother?","[INTERVIEWED]: She would have... you know she had a great sense of regal. She had a great sense of... She had a love for the Queen. She had a love for the Royal Family. She really respected the Queen. And she loved the pomp and ceremony – and circumstance – but she loved the ceremony. The fact is, she loved the UK...","[INTERVIEWER]: She would have loved you to get a state visit, right?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, she would go back every year to Scotland. She just thought it was incredible. You know, she came over here when she was 19, she came over to the United States when she was 19. She met my father very... it was not a long time. They got married, they were married many many decades and they had a great marriage. You know, she was a terrific woman, and maybe that's... and again she loved Scotland and maybe that's one of the reasons that I feel the same way...","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you feel sad that neither of your parents ever got to see their son become [INTERVIEWED] of the United States?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I do, but they're seen me have great success, because I've had great success. And you know, I've been successful even if you talk about, I do a show on television. They always turn out... very rarely does a show become a big hit like I had. I go into that, the real estate... I've had a lot of hits. So they got to see a lot, but there's nothing like what happened here. I mean, the presidency is something special, but more importantly, I'm so happy with the results, because if you look at what's going on, and you look at our country, and you look at the way it's thriving. We're having a stock market like just about they've never had before. Ever before. We've picked up... Piers, we've picked up $8 trillion in value during the course of 12 months...","[INTERVIEWER]: I just want to pick you up on one thing about the reaction in Britain. Because a lot of people don't like you in Britain, fuelled by these politicians, fuelled by some of the more inflammatory things you've said. The one particular thing, because I want to try and just clarify with you – you retweeted an organisation called Britain First, one of the leaders, three times. And this caused...","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, three times – boom boom boom.","[INTERVIEWER]: This caused huge anxiety and anger in my country, because Britain First is basically bunch of racists, fascists...","[INTERVIEWED]: Of course, I didn't know that.","[INTERVIEWER]: Well, that's what I wanted to clarify with you. What did you know about them when you did those tweets?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I know nothing about them, and I know nothing about them today other than I read a little bit, and I guess – and again, I'm in the United States, so I don't read as much about it. Perhaps it was a bit story in Britain, perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it wasn't a big story. I did a retweet. You know, a retweet sometimes you do... When you do your own tweeting or you do your own social media, it's fine. When you do those retweets, they can cause problems, because you never know who's doing it to start off with.","[INTERVIEWER]: The way it was interpreted – you didn't take those down retweets for several weeks – the way it was interpreted was, you were effectively endorsing this bunch of racists, and that caused a lot of anger.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I don't know who they are. I know nothing about them, so I wouldn't be doing that. And I am as I say often, I am the least racist person that anybody's going to meet. And certainly I wasn't endorsing anybody. I knew nothing about them. They had a, I guess, a couple of depictions of radical Islamic terror. Radical Islamic terror, whether you like talking about it or not Piers, is...","[INTERVIEWER]: No, I'm going to come and talk about it.","[INTERVIEWED]: ...Because you look at what's going on, you look at what's going on in the UK, you look at what's going on all over the world...","[INTERVIEWER]: And you're absolutely right about that.","[INTERVIEWED]: So you can try and shield it and say...","[INTERVIEWER]: I'm not shielding anything. I do just want to get one thing out of you.","[INTERVIEWED]: Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]: Given the amount of offence it caused, and given that you've now acknowledged that you didn't know who these people were – they've had their accounts suspended by Twitter – do you regret now those retweets and do you wish you, with hindsight, hadn't done it?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, you know, look. It was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror. This was a depiction of radical Islamic terror.","[INTERVIEWER]: They were unverified videos. At least one of them was not what it seemed.","[INTERVIEWED]: But this was... I didn't do it, I didn't go out and... I did a retweet. It was a big story where you are, but it was not a big story where I am.","[INTERVIEWER]: I get that, I get that.","[INTERVIEWED]: So you're telling me something...","[INTERVIEWER]: This is airing in Britain, and I want them to get to the real you.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I tell you, the real me is someone who loves Britain, who loves the UK, who loves... I love Scotland. I wish... You know, one of the biggest problems I have in winning – I won't be able to get back there so often. I would love to go there, as you know before this happened, I would be there a lot. Very special people and a very special place. So I don't want to cause any difficulty for your country, that I can tell you.","[INTERVIEWER]: Can I get an apology out of you just for the retweets of Britain First?","[INTERVIEWED]: If you're telling me they're...","[INTERVIEWER]: I think it would go a long way.","[INTERVIEWED]: Here's what's fair. If you're telling me these are horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that. I know nothing about them.","[INTERVIEWER]: And you would disavow yourself of people like that?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't want to be involved with people, but you're telling me about these people, because I know nothing about these people.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]: Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER]: It means a lot to people in Britain. On the issue of trade, you were very encouraging when you met Theresa May. And Barack Obama came over to Britain just before the EU referendum and said if we voted to Leave, we'd go to the back of the queue. What is your position now? Are we at the front of the queue for a new trade deal with America?","[INTERVIEWED]: So we are going to make a deal with the UK, that will be great. As you know, somewhat restricted. Because of Brexit you have a two year restriction. And when that restriction is up we're going to be your great trading partner. It's a tough restriction to have. You know for a couple of years, you have very strong lack of being able to do things.","[INTERVIEWER]: [How come you called the referendum result correctly?]","[INTERVIEWED]: Because I know the British people and I understand the British people, and the British people wanted to have control over their country. And they don't want to have people coming from all over the world into Britain and they don't know anything about these people. And I said because of immigration, and to a certain extent because of trade, but mostly immigration, I said that Brexit is going to be a big upset and I was right.","[INTERVIEWER]: And now we've seen how it's played out. Do you believe that we're in a good position in Britain? A lot of people are still very nervous, very anxious, but hearing [INTERVIEWED] of the United States saying 'There's plenty of good trade coming from me' – that's a big deal to people in Britain.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate the way it was negotiated. But I have a lot of respect for your Prime Minister, and I think they're doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude.","[INTERVIEWER]: What would you have done?","[INTERVIEWED]: I think I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out... I have a lot of problems with the European Union.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yeah. You've done business with them.","[INTERVIEWED]: They're very... no, it's not a question of doing business. But I will tell you, representing the United States, it's a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in. It's very very tough. And yet they send their product to us – no taxes, very little taxes, it's very unfair. I've had a lot of problems with the European Union, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade. They're not the only ones by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very very unfair to the United States, and I think it'll turn out to be very much to their detriment.","[INTERVIEWER]: So are we front of the queue? Or are we behind the French? Because we're a bit worried about Emmanuel Macron who's been all over you trying to be your new best friend.","[INTERVIEWED]: No, I like him. He's a friend of mine. Em-man-u-el! He's a great guy, his wife is fantastic. I like him a lot. You know, we had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower.","[INTERVIEWER]: Well he rolled out the red carpet!... My irritation with my country. We've given state visits to Bashar al-Assad, to Robert Mugabe, to Vladimir Putin and to [INTERVIEWED] Xi. So the implication from them trying to ban you, is that somehow you're worse than they are.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well I hadn't heard about banning, but I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for. And I do stand for tough borders.","[INTERVIEWER]: I'm going to come to that now, but to those who don't, what do you say to them?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't care, I don't care. It's just one of those things. I don't say anything. You know why? Because I don't care.","[INTERVIEWER]: Let's turn to security, national security. You've been very tough on this. You vowed again, in an interview with Good Morning Britain, you were going to hammer ISIS hard. ISIS is now out of Iraq and Syria. I mean, that's a big double success for you, right?","[INTERVIEWED]: By the way, we would have never been there with the previous administration.","[INTERVIEWER]: Are we winning the war..?","[INTERVIEWED]: And I have to say this. With the economy, had the previous administration in its own form, in a different form, or let's put it, had the Democrats won – instead of being almost 50% up, they would have been 50% down, because the United States was heading in a very bad direction. Yeah, we've done very well in Iraq, we've done very well in Syria, we've hammered them. But they spread. They go all over. It's not a good situation, and nobody knows it better than the folks in the UK. You've had some tough bouts.","[INTERVIEWER]: A lot of Muslims think you hate them. That you hate Muslims.","[INTERVIEWED]: No, totally false. No, that's false.","[INTERVIEWER]: Clarify what you feel about that.","[INTERVIEWED]: I feel love for all people, but if a person's bad, we've got to do something about it. There's got to be retribution. But I've had great great relationships with Muslims, and I had good support from Muslims during my [INTERVIEWED]ial run. And I think I have good support right now. You know, it's interesting. They want to be safe also, Piers. And they like me because I give them security. I have a great relationship and respect for Muslims.","[INTERVIEWER]: Only 8 people were killed in American by Islamist terrorism in 2017. By comparison, domestic gun violence killed at least 30,000. There was another mass shooting in a school this week in Kentucky – the 12th this year alone. Two of the worst mass shootings in American history have happened on your watch, in Las Vegas and at the church in Texas. People will be saying you're very tough on security, you want to keep Americans safe, but if you don't do anything about gun violence at all, that seems an irrational position, for somebody who wants to keep America safe.","[INTERVIEWED]: I'm a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at Paris, where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by one for a long time, they just killed and hundreds of people wounded to this day still in the hospitals. That was one of the worst. And you've had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you wouldn't have had hundreds of people killed... By the way, you have many of those. You look at San Bernardino, California. These guys walk in – the people that they knew – they walk in and they start one by one shooting them. They had no chance.","[INTERVIEWER]: But here's the difference...","[INTERVIEWED]: Piers, they had no chance.","[INTERVIEWER]: OK, but let me give you the other side of this coin. I come from a country with very few guns. We have 32 deaths a year. In America, every day...","[INTERVIEWED]: You have a lot of terrorism.","[INTERVIEWER]: Right. That's separate to it, but on the gun issue. Let me just put this to you. The Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, he bought 55 guns legally in the year prior to his rampage, including 13 AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, which he then equipped with bump stocks, which effectively converted them into machine guns, which are illegal. And he rained bullets down on 20,000 people in America.","[INTERVIEWED]: I remember it very well. It was terrible.","[INTERVIEWER]: Why has nothing been done to stop somebody doing that again?","[INTERVIEWED]: We do have gun control laws, and this sick person – he was a sicko. I mean that's the big problem, there's sick people. If he didn't have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else.","[INTERVIEWER]: But he had 55 guns.","[INTERVIEWED]: The point is he would have had 55 bombs. He would have had 55 of something else.","[INTERVIEWER]: Why can't you make it difficult for him?","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, it's an argument that people have... I've heard it every different way and we can go around this argument. I'm a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security. I think it would be far worse. I think you need it for security. But again, you've had so many attacks where there was only a gun – a bad person's gun – going in this direction, and if you had one on the other side – so many. In fact, that's a very big example. And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would have saved a lot of lives. So I get what you're saying, but I believe in the Second Amendment.","[INTERVIEWER]: Quick fire – climate change. For you, is it about the science or is it about the money? The Paris Accords.","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it's about everything and I'm a believer in clean air and clear water. The Paris Accord for us would have been a disaster...","[INTERVIEWER]: Are you completely out of that?","[INTERVIEWED]: I'm completely out of it.","[INTERVIEWER]: No way back?","[INTERVIEWED]: There could be a way back. First of all, it was a terrible deal for the United States. If they made a good deal, like if they made a good deal with TPP – you know, having to do with trade – there's always a chance we'd get back, but it was a terrible deal for the United States. It was unfair to the United States.","[INTERVIEWER]: Do you believe in climate change? Do you believe it exists?","[INTERVIEWED]: There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look – it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. Right?","[INTERVIEWER]: Right.","[INTERVIEWED]: That wasn't working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records, so OK, they're at a record level. There were so many thing happening, Piers. I'll tell you what I believe in. I believe in clear air. I believe in crystal clear beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris Accord, if we could go back into the Paris Accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal, As usual, they took advantage of the United States. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel... No, no, I like Emmanuel, I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States.","[INTERVIEWER]: Quick question on trophy hunting. You seemed to indicate that you've had a change of mind about this, or you'd like the administration to.","[INTERVIEWED]: I changed it. I didn't want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks bought back into this. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they're saying, where money goes toward – well money in that case was going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I do not, I turned that order around. That was an order.","[INTERVIEWER]: I know you did. I was very pleased to see that.","[INTERVIEWED]: I turned that order around.","[INTERVIEWER]: I tweeted to congratulate you.","[INTERVIEWED]: Were you shocked? Were you shocked?","[INTERVIEWER]: I was surprised, but I also said to people you will listen to argument. And my problem with all the hysterical liberals who lie on the floor kicking and screaming all day long about you, if they actually tried to reason with you and argue with you, I noticed on that you indicated you'd changed your mind and you've now said you have...","[INTERVIEWED]: That was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. That same day even. Not even a day went by. No, I was not believing in conservation that...","[INTERVIEWER]: People will love to hear that. A question about your health. Everyone was being led to believe that you were insane, and physically incredibly unfit. It turned out from your recent medical that you are 30/30 in your cognitive tests...","[INTERVIEWED]: Which most people are not going to do too well on.","[INTERVIEWER]: Right. You've got to hand it to you. As you said 'stable genius'. Your words.","[INTERVIEWED]: I am a stable genius.","[INTERVIEWER]: And healthy. You've never had a drink, you've never smoked, you've never taken drugs. We do see lots of pictures of you with burgers and Cokes and stuff. It's an unusual diet.","[INTERVIEWED]: Don't want to change that! No, they build that up. I eat fine food, I eat really... some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food. I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually when you're campaigning there's a lot of sense to it because it's boom boom boom. But no, I think I eat actually quite well.","[INTERVIEWER]: Have you got an invite to the royal wedding?","[INTERVIEWED]: Have I?","[INTERVIEWER]: Yeah.","[INTERVIEWED]: Not that I know of.","[INTERVIEWER]: Would you like to go?","[INTERVIEWED]: I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple.","[INTERVIEWER]: Meghan Markle did say you were a divisive misogynist.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I still hope they're happy.","[INTERVIEWER]: I'm going to make you happy, because your son Barron is a massive fan of my football team in London, Arsenal.","[INTERVIEWED]: That's true!","[INTERVIEWER]: And we saw pictures of him... he's an Arsenal fan. We've been going through a rough patch for a long period of time. People think it's time for a change of leadership at my club. Barron, I'm sure, shares my view, right? I have something for you. I've done – this is an Arsenal shirt.","[INTERVIEWED]: He'll be so happy.","[INTERVIEWER]: ...'TRUMP 45?. We're looking for a new leader who has an attacking philosophy, who believes in a strong defensive wall and believes in winning at all costs. And only wants big trophies.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well I think that's beautiful. You know I have a son who does love this sport. He loves this sport.","[INTERVIEWER]: And he loves Arsenal, right?","[INTERVIEWED]: And it's growing very rapidly in the United States.","[INTERVIEWER]: Are you an Arsenal fan?","[INTERVIEWED]: Not particularly, no...","[INTERVIEWER]: Don't kill the dream [INTERVIEWED]!","[INTERVIEWED]: But I have a friend who owns Manchester United so I know exactly what I'm going to do with it.","[INTERVIEWER]: Really? Wow! That will kill our special relationship! Anyway, that's for you, and if you do want to come and manage Arsenal, we would love it.","[INTERVIEWED]: That's great! That's beautiful. We'll do very well!","[INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], it's been great to catch up with you. Thank you very much for your time.","[INTERVIEWED]: Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpolishjournalists","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me say at the outset of this interview that this visit is in no way intended to complicate the situation there -- rather to show American interest in Poland, to support the general desire that we feel for Poland to have improved relations with the United States and with the West in general. It is, obviously, as I will in every country -- give me a chance to give our views freely and openly about freedom and things of that nature, but it is not a visit that is trying to complicate matters between the Soviet Union and Poland, or anything else. It is in keeping with my view that Europe should be whole and free, and in saluting the changes that have taken place, and hopefully in contributing to Poland's quest for more democracy and economic reform. So, we're going in a constructive vein, not in some critical vein or not in some mode of trying to complicate things for somebody else.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Visit to Poland","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], this group here -- the composition of this group is actually a testimony to the progress of pluralism, because we have Solidarity here on the Government's side. Yes, and isn't it, [INTERVIEWED], very interesting that you were in Poland about 1 year and 9 months ago, and now you are going to Poland again? Is there any particular reason that you make the second trip in such a short time?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, in the first visit, we had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Walesa [Solidarity leader], and certainly I was accorded wonderful hospitality by General Jaruzelski [Chairman of Poland's Council of State]. At that time, as you point out, Ziggy, there was no real communication between Solidarnosc and the leadership. And again, I, in that visit, did not try to involve myself in the internal affairs of Poland. But by being there, and by being permitted to speak on the television and say what was in my heart, and able to meet with Jaruzelski -- I mean, with Walesa, even though Solidarnosc was then outlawed, it opened up for us a strong feeling for Poland, and you could sense the indications of change.","And now there has been change; there has been an evolution in these relationships. And so, it is appropriate that we go back and talk respectfully to the leaders about their aspirations for economic reform, my aspirations for an era of what we call in our East-West relations \"beyond containment,\" and in terms of the evolution of -- the moving of countries toward the West as much as they feel comfortable with.","So, it's a visit that makes sense because things are evolving, things are moving in the direction that we salute. And also, going there as Vice [INTERVIEWED], I am sure, is quite different than being [INTERVIEWED]. There's only one [INTERVIEWED], and true, there's only one Vice [INTERVIEWED]. But that isn't seen the same as the [INTERVIEWED] going there to say how much an evolving relationship means to the United States.","[INTERVIEWER]. So, let me ask maybe more precisely, [INTERVIEWED], what would you tell the Polish Nation about the American attitude toward our efforts to achieve self-determination, about all those free elections which took place recently in Poland, about our achievements in gaining free speech and the restoration of our free will in Poland?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'd simply say the visit is a symbol of our support for Poland as it moves toward greater democracy. And I had a chance to make that point a couple of years ago and will make it again. So, it's symbolic. I will state that we are encouraged by changes. I'll try not to look like I'm fine-tuning the internal affairs of Poland. I'm not going to do that, but I think I have every right to say I am encouraged by the changes we've seen.","Obviously, we followed the roundtable discussions and agreement, and salute that agreement. As you know, we are committed to representation by the people, of the people. And so, we see changes in the way elected representatives are chosen and go forward to represent their people -- we salute that.","So, it will be in this vein, this thematic vein, that I will be talking. And in Poland, you know, there's an historic opportunity now to help end the postwar division of Europe. I mean, Europe has been divided. And if we handle ourselves correctly with the Soviet Union and if the changes continue that we're seeing, we could see a Europe that is freer and more whole.","[INTERVIEWER]. That's what you said in 1983 in Vienna in your -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, and I talked about differentiation there. And, indeed, that Vienna trip led to my feeling very comfortable going with a similar message to Poland. So, it's evolutionary here.","Foreign Troops Deployed in Europe","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], already during the first few minutes of this interview, you used, several times, the word \"change,\" because everybody now sees the changes taking place in Poland. For some, the changes are too slow; for some, are too quick.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. But as a very experienced politician, you certainly know that good policy requires not only change but also some elements of stability that prevent the change from erupting, from being blown up and leading to some kind of a deep crisis. Would you like to comment about what elements of continuity in central and Eastern Europe would you like to see?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'd like to see respect for the will of the people. And I think as we -- I don't want to -- well, let me start over. I will stand by that, obviously, but I would like to see -- very candidly -- I'd like to see Soviet troops -- we're talking about Poland now -- out. I don't think anyone, anymore, thinks that there's a danger of invasion from the West into Poland, for example. And I would like to see a continuation of the change that would result in the Soviets feeling comfortable in taking their troops out of there.","Having said that, I will not be trying to inflame change so that it does what you're talking about. The people seem to be handling it very nicely now, with elections and with discussions around a table. And I don't want to do something that would inadvertently do what you're talking about, or that you asked about; and that is, to have some crisis that will compel other answers. And I don't want that, and I'm not going to deliberately do anything that is going to cause a crisis.","I am going to feel free to speak out about -- as I did right now at the Iwo Jima Monument -- about what we hold dear and what Polish-Americans think and what we want to see about a freer, a more whole Europe. And so, I think we can do this, Daniel, without exacerbating tensions that I know exist in Poland. We're realistic; we know there are tensions still.","[INTERVIEWER]. But this shall mean that -- are you in favor of withdrawing foreign troops from all Europe, from all countries?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would like to see the start be withdrawing of the troops from Poland, because I think there is no danger at all of an invasion of Poland from the West. And I don't think anybody in Poland thinks there's a danger of invasion of Poland from the West.","But what I will do, in answer to your question, is to press forward with a very bold plan that we've laid on the table at NATO which substantially reduces U.S. and Soviet troops deployed outside their borders, and that sends a good signal. And then we go for whatever the next step might be; but as long as we have this tremendous disparity in Soviet-deployed troops or bloc troops versus NATO troops, it's pretty hard to visualize eliminating all troops. But I think we're on the right track, and we're on the right step here. And so, we'll go down that road.","U.S. Assistance for Poland","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], let me go back to your coming back to Poland, if I may. In September you had a chance to talk to General Jaruzelski, who is both the man who introduced martial law, but also the roundtable talks and the first honest elections since the Second World War. What are you expecting of your conversation, of your forthcoming conversation now, with the General?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, obviously, we've got a baseline. We have a point of departure, because with respect, he gave me probably a disproportionate amount of time. I was the Vice [INTERVIEWED]; he was the head of the whole country. And thus, I remember with sincerity what I thought was great courtesy to me. And through that courtesy, we had more than a passing conversation; we had a conversation about a lot of things that now have changed. We even had a chance to talk about Solidarnosc with Jaruzelski, his knowing my view and his making very clear to me his view at the time.","Now there's been an evolution of views. And what I think we ought to do is pick up from where we started and then say: All right, we've come along here. We want to help you in an economic sense. Some of that won't be easy, because the concept of reform -- economic reform -- to get full cooperation from these international institutions, monetary institutions, is essential. And I expect he'll be saying, I've tried to make reforms, and don't push me too far on all this.","And I'll understand that, but I'll say: Please understand my position. We want to help you with OPIC; we want to help you with privatization; we want to help you in the international institutions and with special trade benefits. But we need to know that you're going to be able to not only continue existing reforms but expand on reforms so that the economic system that works will be given a chance to work unfettered. And that's a big key, and that isn't easy for a lot of regimes all around the world. It's not just Poland and Hungary and Eastern Europe; it's many countries.","And so, I know that what I'll be talking about will not be easy for the regime to accommodate or, indeed, even for those who have been in opposition. And I'm talking now about newly elected people, too. But I think I owe the people with whom I meet our honest assessment, and I owe them my frank view of what we can do, and what it's going to take for us to be able to do it in terms of economic support.","[INTERVIEWER]. Just pressing this a bit, [INTERVIEWED], will you intend to set any specific conditions for the U.S. aid to Poland, and would you like to have control over implementing such conditions, if any?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not control -- we cannot try to control the internal affairs of another country -- but we've got to be clear that to get the kind of financial support from the outside world and the kind of private investment that I think can be enormously helpful, that certain reforms must go forward.","But I'm not going there in an arrogant mode, trying to say we've got all the answers. I mean, he might turn around and ask me about our debt -- [laughter] -- and then I'd be embarrassed.","[INTERVIEWER]. I have, [INTERVIEWED] -- --","[INTERVIEWED]. In fact, he might; and if he did, that would be fine. I'll tell him what we're trying to do about it. And one of the things we're trying to do about it is to live within our means, and that gives us less money available to do many of the things I'd like to be doing around the world, you know. So, then we're kind of on a catch-22 on that one. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. I sometimes get the impression that both sides, Poland and the Western alliance countries, are expecting too much from each other. The West is expecting from us to change the system, to change the economic system, to introduce pluralistic democracy and, at the same time, to preserve the necessary level of stability and prevent the country from collapse. On the other hand, our country expects from the West such a significant assistance that would make all these changes possible to happen in a country which is so heavily indebted and its economy is in such a mess.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think you raise a very interesting point -- and very carefully phrased, I noticed. But that's why I keep saying I don't want to exacerbate tensions. I don't want to make competing forces move apart inadvertently. I don't want to say something that would complicate the move that is taking place towards democratization and economic reform. I feel confident enough that both of those things are necessary for Poland -- for Poles to enjoy the freedoms that I think most Poles aspire to. But I'm not going to say hey, you've got to have a Senate with 100 people and a Congress with 435 and a [INTERVIEWED] and a Vice [INTERVIEWED] and 50 States. I mean, that's our system.","But I am going to say we've got common thoughts here. I think of the Polish people as treasuring freedom. I think of them fighting -- having a tough go there in World War II and standing up to the hordes that finally just were too much. I think of the patriotism of Poland. I think of the affection that Americans of Polish heritage have for Poland.","And I'd like to try to have the interlocutors, the people I talk to -- whether they're labor or whether they're in the regime -- understand that we want to help and that we do admire the changes that have taken place, and not put it into a great East-West mode all the time. We have problems. I'm keeping my eyes open, but we're going to try to improve relations with the Soviet Union.","But I can't look at these outrageous differences in conventional forces, for example, and then say to everybody in the United States, hey, we don't need to be concerned about Soviet intentions. They're modernizing their intercontinental stuff, their nuclear weapons. They've got disproportionate advantage in conventional forces. And so, I'm not going to be naive in suggesting that we have no differences between us, as it relates to the Soviet Union. And when Gorbachev talks about a European house, we say, yes, but let all the doors be open; let it be done so people can move from room to room in that house -- and that shouldn't antagonize anybody.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you have been known as a conciliator, as a consensus-builder, as an adversary of extreme solutions. Can we write that George Bush, the [INTERVIEWED] of the United States, is unequivocally in favor of an evolutionary change in Poland without outbursts, without breaking down of the dialog among the different social forces? Can we write that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, you can write it. I don't want you to write it in such a way that I seem to discourage those who may have differences. In other words, I don't want to discourage those that have felt out and are trying to get in, those who didn't participate over the past many years in elections and are now able to participate. I don't want to endorse the status quo -- I mean, that's not my role. Nor do I want to do what you're talking about, that your question asked about, which is exacerbate tensions.","What I want to do is say, \"Here's what we stand for.\" Here's what the United States stands for; and here are our aspirations for a relationship with the Soviet Union, which obviously is the superpower there. And here are my aspirations for Poland that come from my heart, because I can feel it strongly -- how those who came to our country from this country feel about their homeland. And I'd leave it there, Ziggy, rather than try to endorse the status quo. But I have to exhort and encourage as much economic reform as possible, as much political freedom as possible. And if I don't do that, I will not be leveling with the Polish people, and I will not be being a good [INTERVIEWED] for my own -- for the United States.","So, I don't think it's as delicate as perhaps before, but I -- and it's important. You see, I have no hangups when Gorbachev goes to Germany or France -- fine, let him go. The better hand he gets and the better he is received there -- they're saying, \"Atta boy! Keep it up!\" Keep what up? Keep reforming up; keep changing up. Who would have thought you'd hear lively debates in their own political process 2 years ago? So, it doesn't bother me as [INTERVIEWED] of the United States that he gets a good standing on the applause meters over there in Western Europe. Nor should it bother him when I take this message of freedom and democracy to Eastern Europe. In my view, that doesn't come under the heading of his business, just as it doesn't come under the heading of mine if he goes to France or Germany.","And so, it's in that vein I go to -- not competitively. Saying you want one house? Fine. Let's get all the rooms open so we can all move around in there. And let's find out what works in the economy, what works in terms of free unions, what works in terms of free politics. And we think we can speak to that because we've had some success. We're not saying we have no problems in the United States, but in these things -- moving around, freedom to say what you think, freedom to form a union, freedom to have a voice in the politics by the people -- we think we know what we're talking about there. We want to share it with you. So, it's in that spirit that we'll be going.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I think that Daniel has one personal question for you. Just one.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], last question of a little personal character. If you were a young Pole, would you now queue in front of an American consulate to emigrate to the United States, or would you rather stay in Poland and fight the difficult fight there?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't know what a young Pole would be thinking, but what I think -- what I'd like to think he'd be thinking -- is, look, I'm living in a time of dynamic change. This is the time of most hope for my country in a long, long time. And I want to be a part of it, and I want to participate. I want to run for election; I want to join a free association; I want to be a part of a government to bring economic relief to my people. And I want to see Poland appreciated around the world -- its art, its culture, its heroism. And I want -- I, young guy Stanislaw, whatever my name is, at 21 years old -- I want to be a part of this. And that's the way I'd like to do it -- that's the way I would hope that some young kid could look at it.","Now, maybe that's a little much, because in economically difficult times, people kind of think, hey, the grass looks a little greener over there; the ocean doesn't look quite so wide. If I could just make it to Chicago, maybe I could do something. But even if he makes it to Chicago, he's got to have, beating in his heart, the love of his homeland. And so, I would hope that most would say, look, I want to be a part of the change that I feel in the air, you see.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you all."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithpolishjournalists0","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. I'm looking forward to our state dinner. It's a chance for me to, on a personal level, repay the favor of my friend Aleksander for his great hospitality to Laura and me when we visited he and Jolanta there in Warsaw. Secondly, it's a chance to say to our country and the world how important our relations are with Poland. We really think—respect the Polish people. We've got great numbers of Polish Americans who still love the motherland. And it's going to be a wonderful occasion to build on a great relationship, make it even better.","We will discuss a lot of topics. We'll talk about the war on terror. Poland has been a great friend and supporter, member of the coalition on the war against terror. We've got troops in the—on ships off the Indian Ocean. We've got engineers in Bagram, shared intelligence. Aleksander has been a strong friend and supporter. I'm confident he'll want to talk about NATO expansion. Perhaps I'll leave that for a question.","But all in all, we've got great relations, and I look forward to having a good conversation with a leader I respect. And I respect Aleksander Kwasniewski.","Why don't we start with you, sir.","Democracy in Poland","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you. [INTERVIEWED], about your talks with [INTERVIEWED] Kwasniewski next week, Poland has been viewed by your administration as one of the most successful examples of democratic transformation. However, the current Polish Government is taking some steps and adopting some laws which would obviously limit independence of media and central bank, which are the pillars of democracy. So are you going to raise these issues with the [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I've got faith that a democracy will work. And I am confident that the Polish Government and the Polish people will come up with the right answers to issues relating to any law. I will—of course, if he asks my opinion, I will remind him that an independent media is a very important part of democracy. It's one of the pillars of democracy. I value our media, as an aside, saying that of course to pander to the people here that cover me on a daily basis. [Laughter]","But I do value a free and open media, and I think it's an incredibly important part. But your opening statement was true. We value the progress that Poland has made and the example Poland has set in a neighborhood that was a pretty tough neighborhood for awhile. And I was most impressed, when I went to Warsaw, to see the spirit of the people and the optimism. I understand the country is going through tough times, but all countries go through tough times.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Upcoming Visit to Troy, Michigan","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you're taking Aleksander Kwasniewski—it was your decision to go to Troy, Michigan, to meet with Polish Americans.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, we are.","[INTERVIEWER]. What is the reason for that meeting, and if you could tell us, what is your message to Polish Americans?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, the message to Polish Americans is, I respect and honor the Polish traditions and Polish heritage. Actually, there was a—even in my own State of Texas, there is a community or two that Polish Americans have settled in Texas and still retains many of the great traditions and heritages.","It also reminds people that even though they have got a Polish heritage and embraced Polish traditions, they're Americans. It's a great part of the American experience. We envelop and welcome people from all walks of life. That in itself is an important statement to constantly make in our country. It reminds people of the strength of the country.","I've decided to go to Troy, Michigan, because it's going to be a—I hope it's a fun trip for Aleksander. I mean, I think it's important—I understand what a state dinner is like. It's formal. You'll see; it's going to be a grand day. They arrive on the South Lawn. The military will be there. There's a lot of pomp and circumstance. It's an exciting ceremony; it really is. And then there will be the formal dinners and the black tie, and the people will come, and the entertainment and the food—it's going to be great.","But there's more to a good American experience than just a formal dinner. I try to wear a tuxedo as little as possible, I want you to know. But flying out there to Michigan, the heartland of the country, with our friend, is going to be great. And he's going to see a big, enthusiastic crowd. It will give him a chance to say some things. And I think that's important to provide him a forum, so that he can not only be seen in a tuxedo but be seen speaking his mind about whatever issue he wants to talk about to an American audience that is made up of people from his homeland that have now settled in our country. I think it's going to be a great event. To me, it helps complete the state dinner aspect of the trip.","U.S. Economy","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I talked to Mr. Kwasniewski just before yesterday.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. How is he doing?","[INTERVIEWER]. Great. He looks good, in good shape.","[INTERVIEWED]. Looking forward to a 3mile run? [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. He told me that one of the topics he would like to touch on is the recent financial scandals in the U.S., because they are a kind of backlash on Central Europe, and the recovery is difficult. And there's this feeling outgoing that the U.S. Government is not doing enough to change its own rules to really prevent the backlash for a Central European——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I'll explain to him we are doing things, and I will be glad to lay out the initiative I talked about— and have been talking about, by the way, since March—February and March and then the speech I gave in New York. And of course, our House has acted—the House of Representatives acted, and the Senate has acted. And if he looks at what I proposed and what the Senate has proposed and what the House proposed, there's not much difference. And in other words, the point is that a bill will come out that will hold people accountable for accounting error—accounting fraud and, as we go forward, hopefully set an example—make it clear to people, there will be a consequence if they continue to do that.","There are markets—three things affect our markets, I'll explain to Aleksander. One of course is confidence and the numbers, and we're addressing that. Secondly is the war on terror. People are still—you know, realize that America is still a target. And the American people know that we're doing everything we can to protect the homeland and run down these killers wherever they try to hide. And that's all they are, by the way, just nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers. And thirdly, the corporate sector—the profits are beginning to improve, but the price-earnings multiples— in other words, the price of a share relative to its earnings—was very high, and the market is adjusting. So all three of those factors are important.","And obviously we—that's not the whole picture of our economy, and that's what Aleksander has got to understand. The market reflects part of it, but our unemployment rate is—looks like it's steady. It has stopped rising. As a matter of fact, it had a drop, and it's level. Our consumer spending numbers are up. Our manufacturing orders are increasing. In other words, the recovery is beginning to show some strength. So therefore, what I'm going to ask him is to look at the entire picture.","Finally, we've got good monetary policy and good fiscal policy here in Washington, and that in itself is part of long-term recovery. And so he'll hear a man who is—recognizes that we're making some progress. We've got to do more, but I'm pleased to report to him that I think things are going to get better. The foundation for long-term growth has been—is in place.","War on Terrorism","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I wanted to ask you a question about the war against terrorism. The Europeans seem to less and less support the war against terrorism. And I wonder if you could explain to us, why do you think it's happening, and if you are ready to go alone on this next phase of the war, whatever the phase is?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I don't feel that the support from Europe is lessening. As a matter of fact, I've just come from a G- 8 meeting in Canada where, to a person, they were very supportive of our war on terror, because the Europeans recognize that the terrorists could strike them just as easy as they could strike us. We've still got great intelligence sharing amongst our nations. We've got good police action. We have hauled in—\"we\" being the coalition— has hauled in—that means arrest—2,400, more than 2,400 terrorists. So we're picking them off, one by one. This is a different kind of war.","I use every chance I get, when I speak to the American people, to explain why this is different. And so—as opposed to destroying lines of tanks or shooting down airplanes, success is measured by—one by one, one person at a time. And the European leaders understand that, and they've been very supportive. They still—I think we've got about 8,000 troops in Afghanistan—we do, in the Afghan theater, and there's another 8,000 troops from other nations there as well. So it's a firm commitment.","I will continue to communicate and consult with our friends and allies as to every stage of the war, as the battlefront shifts. By the way, the battlefront isn't shifting out of Afghanistan. We're there. We'll remain there. We've got a lot of work to do there. There's still Al Qaida killers there. And of course we'll need to continue to have deliberations with our friends and allies, and we'll have them for future theaters and different operations. We talk to them all the time.","Poland's Purchase of New Fighter Jets","[INTERVIEWER]. Speaking of war, [INTERVIEWED], Poland is going to buy new fighter planes——","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I understand that's the case.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. And the F-16s are one of the——","[INTERVIEWED]. I've got a suggestion for them. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. However, [INTERVIEWED] Kwasniewski just 2 days ago—you kind of—was kind of complaining that maybe the American offer is not meeting enough—expectations. So is——","[INTERVIEWED]. He's negotiating in public. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. Is your administration in any way going to support U.S. companies to win the standard——","[INTERVIEWED]. We will offer a fabulous product——","[INTERVIEWER]. Fabulous product.","[INTERVIEWED]. ——called the F-16. And we will work with our friends to make— you know, to compete on an above-board basis, totally above-board. And you know, we hope the Polish Government picks quality. If they do, they will, of course, come our way. But that's up to the Government. Aleksander will be and the Government of Poland will—you know, we will respect the process and respect the country and appreciate it's a tough decision and hope they make the right decision as far as we're concerned. But that——","Future Role of NATO","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you think that the NATO will play as important role for the United States in the present century as it played in the previous century?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. And do you think it is possible that Russia one day will become NATO member?","[INTERVIEWED]. Interesting question. First, I do think NATO is very important. It's obviously a different role. NATO served as kind of a bulwark in defense against Russian tanks storming across the European Continent. Those days are over. Russia is no longer the enemy. I witnessed the fact that not only have we got good relations with Russia, but the very same trip that I—when I went to Moscow to sign this treaty that literally redefined our relationship from one of distrust and—like it was during the cold war, to a new relationship, shortly thereafter we went to Italy and welcomed a new relationship between NATO and Russia. So the whole relationship has changed for the better.","NATO has—and I think it's going to be very hard—very important to work that relationship with Russia, to allow for the— the new relationship to develop and mature. And I think it will in a very positive way.","The new relationship—the new role of NATO is—really needs to adjust to the new realities of the 21st century, and that is how to best fight the war on terror. And that means a different configuration of the use of our forces and the use of assets. Our forces need to be lighter and quicker to strike, and elite units need to be prepared to move at a moment's notice.","The enemy has changed, and the battlefield, the nature of the battlefield has changed. And therefore, the NATO mission must remain the same, mutual defense. But its tactics must change. And I think NATO is very relevant, and we will be an active and engaged partner in NATO.","Let me just—I'll ask myself, \"Well, [INTERVIEWED], do you think we ought to expand?\" [Laughter] I gave a very important speech in Warsaw. It's interesting—I hope the people in the world that are interested in our opinion on subjects noted that the speech was in Warsaw. And the speech was about a Europe that's whole, free, and at peace. And I talked about the expansion of NATO, and I said that I am interested more rather than less. And at the same time, I urged the applicant countries to take nothing for granted, to work very hard up until the last minute to show those of us in NATO that they'll be willing and active and capable partners.","And I look forward to our meeting in Prague. I fully understand the position of the Polish Government. I've had long discussions with Aleksander on the subject of NATO expansion, and I think people know that I'm forward-leaning, depending—if the member countries, you know, meet their MAP requirements.","Polish and U.S. Central Banks","[INTERVIEWER]. I want to go back to the finances and the limit. There is an attempt in Poland to limit independence of central bank, so it would be more—be manipulated more by Government, so Government would have more influence over central bank. In the current situation, what's your feeling about this?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I don't know all the facts about how the Polish democracy is handling this particular situation. I can tell you, however, from my experience, that a central bank should be independent. And the independence of our central bank gives Chairman Greenspan and the other Governors of the Federal Reserve great credibility in our country, to know that decisions are being made apart from politics. And our central bank is a part of— is a very important part of our—has been and will continue to be a very important part of the economic vitality of our country. It also gives investors who look at our country great confidence to know that the monetary supplies be not based upon politics, but the decisions on monetary supplies will be based upon the vision of some very wise people.","I think, when people look at how capital moves into countries, the independence of a central bank is an important part of attracting capital. And Poland needs to attract capital investment. If anybody were to ask me my advice on the central bank, that's what I would give.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Popularity in Poland/[INTERVIEWED]'s Vacation","[INTERVIEWER]. I'd like to ask you about different subject. According to the latest polls, you are the most popular foreign politician leader in Poland.","[INTERVIEWED]. Really? I usually say I don't believe in polls, but I may have to change my mind. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. With the same approval rate as [INTERVIEWED] Kwasniewski. And I want to ask you to comment on this, and——","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, how high is it?","[INTERVIEWER]. Would you be willing to visit Poland again?","[INTERVIEWED]. Seventy-three?","[INTERVIEWER]. Why don't you go to Poland?","[INTERVIEWED]. Again?","[INTERVIEWER]. On holiday.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks. I don't know what to say. I appreciate that. I'm flattered.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you willing to spend a vacation in Poland? With your parents, obviously?","[INTERVIEWED]. With my parents? I don't know if my mother could stand that. But listen, when I vacation, just kind of know about me, I like to be with my family, and I like to be in Texas.","I just recently went to Maine. I'd love to go to Maine, too, to be with my mother and dad. But my favorite vacation spot is my own ranch in the State I love. And I like to get out and fool around on the land, and it doesn't matter how hot it is or how cold it is. How hot it is and cold it is matters to those who have to follow me. For me, there is no day hot enough or cold enough. [Laughter] These poor souls—Crawford in August. That's my idea of vacation.","Although I must say, I had a great time up with Mother and Dad this weekend, and I love to be around them as well. But this August, I'm going to go down to Texas and actually work out of Texas. I'm going to travel quite a bit. After all, we're getting into the political season here in America. We've got our elections in November of 2002.","September 11/War on Terrorism","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], we talk a lot about how September 11th changed the world, changed America. Has it changed you?","[INTERVIEWED]. Changed me?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't think a single event can change anybody's basic values. It obviously changed the fact that I knew that my time as the [INTERVIEWED] would be dedicated to winning the war on terror and protecting our homeland.","This is—I keep telling people this—it's just a different type of war, because much of the movement of the enemy is invisible to the American people and/or to the world. And yet we know they're there. The killers on September the 11th had been in our country for a period of time. They behaved normally. They looked normal. They, you know, were nonthreatening. It was hard to tell that they were part of this unbelievably evil plot.","And it—we're concerned that another group are here or somewhere, not only here but in other countries in Europe. And so the task is an all-consuming task of protecting our homeland and making sure we do everything we can here to find out if anybody is here and who they are and disrupt their plans and, at the same time, hunt down their leaders.","The wars of the past had known battlefields, and it was clear that such-and-such had to happen. There had to be an invasion in order to achieve this or that. This is a hunt for individuals. We're chasing down one person at a time. They were foolishly collected up at one point in time in the Shahi-Kot Mountains, and it was a tough chore. But our brave soldiers, along with coalition soldiers, were able to go in and score great success at bringing them to justice, as I like to put it.","They're wise to our ways. They realize we're a heck of a lot tougher than they thought. They assumed America was a weak country, that we didn't really believe anything. And they're finding out that's not the way we think. And so I realized after 9/11, after I got over the grief, along with everybody else in our country, that this was a long, very important struggle.","And the struggle goes beyond just fighting an Al Qaida-type network. I have deep concerns about the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction, and so should you, so should anybody who loves freedom, because there are nations in the world developing these weapons who hate freedom, leaders hate freedom. And what we cannot allow happen is these nations to develop these weapons and then blackmail us and/or use them.","We will have—a judgment will have missed history's call to freedom. And so I realize that this war is going to consume a lot of my time. On the other hand, these members of the press know that I am optimistic person who truly believes that we can achieve some positive things out of the evil done to the country and to the world.","So when I talk to our friends, like Aleksander and others, I remind them of this call. We're leaders in a significant moment in history, and we can't blink, and we can't—we must be determined and focused to achieve this important objective, which is peace for our children, is what we're really fighting for, civilization.","Yes, ma'am.","Free Trade","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you always said that you are supporter of removing the trade barriers.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Why do you think there are so many of them still exist?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, because I think the temptation is to be protectionist. And it's easier to mollify constituencies with protectionist rhetoric. Poland suffers from protectionist policies in parts of Europe, as you know. I'm a strong believer in free trade. I want the Congress to give me what's called trade promotion authority. I will exercise that diligently to open up markets.","On the other hand, I have an obligation to enforce law. And so I recently said that the—I listened to an International Trade Commission ruling on steel. The ITC ruled that excessive steel imports were affecting our industry in a negative way. I put a temporary measure in place, which exempted, by the way, Poland. And that was a chance for the steel industry, our own steel industry, to get on its feet. But nevertheless, as I reminded members of the European Union, this only represents a very small portion of the $2 trillion of trade we have each year.","But protectionism, for some, is a viable economic remedy. And in my judgment, protectionism would be bad for the world and bad for our country.","We're opening up—we sent our man to Doha to commit to the next round of the World Trade Organization. And unlike Seattle, where it all fell apart, we were able to—\"we\" being those of us in the world who support free trade—were able to move the process farther down the line. And I will continue to work for free trade. It's in our Nation's interests and the world's interests that we trade. It's in the developing world's interest that there be trade. And our country is—we've got what's called AGOA, agreement with the African countries. I'm working on a free trade agreement with Central Americans. I'd like to see a free trade agreement from Canada all the way down to Argentina.","As I say, there's protectionist tendencies that occasionally rise up. We've just got to convince our respective people that trade is in their interests.","Russia-U.S. Relations","[INTERVIEWER]. There is another [INTERVIEWED] you have such a good relationship; it's [INTERVIEWED] Putin.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Very good working relationship, on terrorism, on oil. But there is this feeling also this is in cost of some human rights, human rights in Chechnya, press freedom in Russia—it's overlooked now—and probably some freedom of some other Russian republics. Don't you worry that this close relationship is putting your—raising other problems?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, a close relationship with Putin allows me to make the case that, on media freedom, for example—as a matter of fact, on my last trip there, I urged him to interface with media entrepreneurs from America to understand how free press actually works, something that they're not very used to in Russia. And so there have been dialog interchanges now with some of our media executives. And I do push Vladimir Putin on the need to have open media and open his media.","And secondly, in terms of Chechnya, I'm constantly talking to Vladimir Putin about relations with Chechnya and understanding and supporting minority rights. The other issue that is very important, to which we do not turn a blind eye, and which I'm deeply concerned, not only about minority rights, is proliferation, matters of proliferation. I think we're making some progress there.","The immediate concern was proliferation to Iran, and I brought that up with Vladimir every time I visited with him. It's a very important issue that he understand that an armed Iran could be very dangerous to his own country, much less to our friends the Israelis or America, itself. And we've had some very important exchanges on that.","In terms of helping make Russia a more secure place, we're working on what they call 10-plus-10-over-10: $10 billion from the U.S., $10 billion from Europe over 10 years to help secure some weapons stockpiles. Vladimir is very interested in working with us to decommission some of his nuclear submarines to make Russia and the world more safe.","In other words, my only point to you is, is that by being closer to Russia, we're able to deal more directly with some of the thorny issues that could separate us and could in fact make the West less likely to deal with Russia.","And we've got another issues at home here that has upset a lot of our people, and that's chickens. Fortunately, we're arguing over chickens and not over war, over chickens and not over missiles, like we used to. But a lot of people here feel like there was a commitment made to let U.S. chickens into Russia. And they started moving into Russia, and all of a sudden they stopped moving into Russia. And so I've been—so whether it be trade or minority rights or press, our relations are such that we're able to bring those up in a very frank and forthright way and yet still moved a very important relationship forward.","Look, friends don't always agree, but friends are more likely to be able to work things out than enemies. As a matter of fact, in the old days, if there was a disagreement between enemies, that could lead to war. And there won't be a war between Russia and the United States.","Situation in the Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a question on another very easy subject, the Middle East crisis.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. What solution do you see to the crisis, and what compromise do you expect from both sides?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that's a very good question. First, I do believe that we can achieve a vision of two states living side by side, at peace with each other. And that's the vision, and that's what all policy must aim toward. It starts with understanding that it's going to be impossible to achieve that vision if terrorists are allowed to have a free run and blow up the process.","An incredibly important step toward the vision of two states living side by side is for the international community, including the Arab world, to work with us to develop the institutions necessary for the emergence of a Palestinian state that will be transparent; it will respect rule of law; it will have a constitution that will allow for a sharing-of-power arrangement; that will have institutions that outlast—are far more important than any single one person.","And we're in the process of working toward that end. Colin Powell will be meeting with what the call the Quad in New York. Foreign Ministers from the Arab world will be coming as well, later on, to work on the step-by-step process toward the emergence of a Palestinian state. And I repeat, that requires a constitution, a judiciary, transparency when it comes to financial conditions. And I believe there's financial aid available. I know there is.","[At this point, the tape machine stopped.]","[INTERVIEWED]. Something just ground to a halt. That thing had, what do we call it, a skidding halt. Sounded like it needs some new tires.","Anyway, the international community wants to help with aid, but they're not going to help with aid if it's going to be stolen. Let's put it very bluntly. And so the——","[The tape machine stopped again.]","[INTERVIEWED]. ——the press conference has clearly gone too long. [Laughter]","So we're working to get these institutions in place. Obviously as security improves, Israel is going to have to, as I said, pull her troops back to September of 2001— 2000 levels. In other words—not levels but geographic—within geographic boundaries of September 2000. They're going to have to deal with the settlements. In other words, all parties have got responsibilities. The Arab world has got responsibilities, by the way, as well, to help on the development of a security force necessary—a security force, by the way, which must exist to enforce security, not enhance the status of a single person.","So we're making progress. It requires a international commitment and a focus on a positive end, which is two states living side by side in peace. As I said, I'm an optimistic fellow and believe that if we stay at it and keep working hard, we can get there. But there's no question in my mind, as I said in my speech in the Rose Garden recently, that there's going to be some setbacks. But our Nation is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.","All right, well, thank you all."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprimeministertonyblairtheunitedkingdomdavidfrostthebritish","text":["Northern Ireland Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. Prime Minister, [INTERVIEWED], it's a great joy to be talking. And let's begin on the subject that's on everybody's minds today, the subject of Northern Ireland. The vote may be more perilously close than was hoped a week or 2 ago. What is your message that each of you have right now to persuade doubting Unionists or doubting Catholics to persuade? How would you both begin?","Prime Minister Blair. I think it's in many ways a battle between fear and emotion on the one hand and reason and hope on the other. And the fear and the emotion is totally understandable, but it is important that people vote for reason and hope. And I say that because people ask me for reassurances on certain of the key items of the agreement. They say, \"Reassure us that the IUC is not going to be disbanded or stop being a proper police force.\" I give that reassurance. That will be plain.","I give the reassurance, the absolute commitment that, if the cross-community provisions in the agreement to exclude people from office if they engage in violence, if those don't work, then they will be changed. That will be in the legislation. I give the explicit commitment to people that decommissioning will be a factor that we take into account, a factor there, specified in the legislation, so that, if people aren't abiding by the decommissioning arrangements of the independent commission on decommissioning, then that can mean their exclusion or removal from office.","I give the explicit commitment that people, whether in the assembly or the shadow assembly, cannot sit in office in Northern Ireland if they're engaged in the ballot box and the gun as a twin strategy.","Now, all those reassurances I can give. But in the end, it depends whether people are really wanting to give themselves the chance for stability and prosperity in the future, because the alternative is not where we are now. The alternative is for Northern Ireland to slip back. So I hope that people will take that chance for the future.","[INTERVIEWER]. What's the reassurance? What's the message you want to get across?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Well, of course, the United States is the home of the largest Irish diaspora, you know, both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics. And so I suppose outside of the people involved, we care more about it than any other people. And I've worked hard to create the conditions within which the Irish could make their own peace. And what I would like to say is, first, I'm convinced there will be a great deal of increased interest in and investment in and partnership with Northern Ireland if this matter can be carried forward.","Secondly, I have made it as clear as I can that anyone who abandons the peace, if this agreement is embraced, anybody who returns to violence is never going to be a friend of the United States. We won't tolerate it. We won't support it. We will do everything we can to affirmatively oppose it.","But finally—I remember when I went there in December of '95. I remember the looks on the faces of the people, especially the young people, the schoolchildren I spoke with, both the Protestant and the Catholic children. And I'd just like to ask the voters to imagine what will happen if they vote no, and what do they really have to lose by voting yes, by giving this a chance? I mean, their leaders came up with this plan. Prime Minister Blair worked very hard on it. Prime Minister Ahern did. But the leaders in Northern Ireland agreed to this plan. What have they got to lose, really, by trying it? Nothing. But they have a great deal to lose by walking away, and I hope that they won't walk away.","[INTERVIEWER]. And you mention, in terms of investment and so on, there are ways in which the new Northern Ireland—you could help the new Northern Ireland?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Oh, absolutely. Of course, we try every year now. We have an International Fund for Ireland. We have a very active group of American citizens from both the Protestant and Catholic communities, Irish citizens who try to increase investment. But I can tell you that the wave of elation that will sweep the friends of Ireland in the United States, should this be accepted, will be enormous. And there will just be a lot more willingness to get involved here and try to help build a future.","[INTERVIEWER]. And in terms of the people, Prime Minister, who say, well, you've got, on the one hand, Sinn Fein saying this is a step toward a united Ireland; you've got David Trimble saying, on the other hand, that this strengthens the Union. How can both be true?","Prime Minister Blair. Well, I think the point is the principle of consent—in other words, that you can argue your case, whether it's for Northern Ireland remaining inside the U.K. or a united Ireland—the principle of consent means you have to argue it by democracy, not violence. And so people are free to argue their case. But it's a way of arguing it that is peaceful.","And one of the strange things about the debate in Northern Ireland is that people aren't actually arguing now about the principle of consent. That was what, for 50, 60 years, divided people in Northern Ireland. People now accept that. They're not even arguing about the institutional structures, the cross-border bobbies, the Northern Ireland Assembly. That in a sense is agreed, as well. It is this fear and emotion, as I say. You see, prisoners is an example of it. And let me again try and go right to the heart of what I think people feel in Northern Ireland. They see the scenes of the Balcombe Street Gang or Michael Stone and they say, \"Well, this is wrong,\" and the \"no\" campaign then say, \"Oh well, the prisoners will be back on the street if you vote for this agreement.\"","Again, the facts are these: Michael Stone and the Balcombe Street Gang were allowed out under provisions on day release made many, many years ago before I even came to government. It had nothing to do with the agreement. Most of the prisoners now in jail in Northern Ireland will be out within a few years anyway. But they'll be out, of course, without the agreement and without stability if there's no vote.","So again, I understand the concerns that people have, but I do ask them to realize that if no is the vote next week, what is the future? What are we going to offer children in Northern Ireland?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. You know, if I could just say sort of as an interested friend, an outside observer—as you know, I've been very involved in the Bosnian peace, in the Middle East peace process—I think, essentially, the people that are for this want a better future for their children and don't want any more violence and like the fact that there is now a process which has been agreed upon for moving forward. If you really listen to the arguments of the people that are against it—and I've tried to listen very respectfully—it is that they still don't trust those on the other side because of all the things that have gone before.","In 1993 Yitzhak Rabin, right before we signed the agreement between Israel and the PLO, said to me, \"I have spent my life as a soldier. I have killed a lot of these people, and they have killed a lot of my people. But,\" he said, \"[INTERVIEWED], you don't make peace with your friends. You make peace, and then you make friends.\" And I think that's important here. But in Northern Ireland the people live much more closely together. They have in some ways—they haven't killed each other in the way the Bosnians did. With all the horrible things, they can get over this if they just will—it's a little bit of a leap of faith, but the risks of doing it are so much less than the risks of walking away.","[INTERVIEWER]. And I think that example is a very relevant one, of Yitzhak Rabin, because that is the problem with the moderate Unionists, some of them, who've got concern. I think you've dealt with the point about the prisoners. You said that a lot of them would be coming out in the next few years anyway, and that links in with their fear of decommissioning of arms and that, therefore, there will be lots of killers running around with arms and so on. But how do you respond to that?","Prime Minister Blair. Well, I respond to it by saying that we will make it quite clear, explicitly in the legislation, that the twin strategy of ballot box and gun is not going to be permitted. And that all the things, in terms of seats in the Northern Ireland executive, in terms of accelerated prisoner release, they can only happen if there's real peace, a real end to violence, an end to violence for good, not temporarily, permanently, an end to violence.","I think it's possible that we can achieve that. But we've got to achieve it with people really making this agreement work. And all the time that we spent trying to put this together, it was agonizingly difficult. And yet in the end, I think there is the will out there amongst people in Northern Ireland; there is the hope to make it work.","Nuclear Proliferation in South Asia","[INTERVIEWER]. We'll come back to that subject before the end of the conversation. But you've been examining a lot of other issues and two issues have come up to take up a lot of your time at this conference. And obviously, one of them is India and, obviously, a slight difference of emphasis on what you think should be done and what you have done than the other members of G-8. Why do you feel the way you do, [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Do you mean why do I think that we should not only condemn the Indian action but take some economic action against India?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. I just think we need to do as much as possible to make it clear that, in the world of today and tomorrow, it is simply unacceptable to build a nuclear arsenal. And it is unrealistic to believe you can build one and you won't use it under any circumstances. Therefore, the main purpose of doing it is to establish yourself as a great nation. That is not a way to define a nation's greatness in the 21st century. And I say that because I think the firmer we are here, the more likely we are to be able to persuade Pakistan, or perhaps other countries lining up behind Pakistan, that they should not test, that they should not try to become public members of the nuclear club. We need to move the world away from it.","I'm trying to get Russia to ratify START II now so we can dismantle our arsenals further and then go to START III and dismantle our arsenals further. I'm trying to take America and Russia in the opposite direction. I'm afraid in our own countries, we'll have people who say, \"Oh, we better not do that if India and Pakistan and other countries are going to build up their arsenals.\" It's just—it's not the way to the future.","[INTERVIEWER]. And so the message to Pakistan— there's rumors that they may be testing next week in western Baluchistan, or whatever— would be that you would take—you feel you should take the same action against them if they did?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Well, under our law, we'll have no choice. In other words, it's an automatic under our law. But what I would say to them is, help us work with you to find a way, first of all, to guarantee your security without nuclear weapons, and secondly, to reconcile with India.","I mean, look at Pakistan and India. You've got one country with 950 million people, another country with nearly 140 million people. They are arguing principally over Kashmir, not entirely but principally. Now, if they could resolve this, if you look at the success of Indians and Pakistanis in the United Kingdom or in the United States and you look at the talent in those two countries and you realize, if they would liberate themselves from this argument between themselves, it is quite conceivable that for the next 50 years they could have the highest growth rates and not just economic success but the richest and most textured quality of life on the Indian subcontinent of any place on the globe. And so I think they should be imagining a different future for themselves, both of them.","Have the rest of us failed to appreciate them as much as we should have? Probably. Have we failed to acknowledge India the incredible achievement of maintaining 50 years of democracy under the most adverse conceivable circumstances? Probably. We should do better. But the answer is not for India to become a nuclear power and then for Pakistan to match it stride for stride, and then for China to be brought in to support the Pakistanis and move troops to the Indian border, and then for Russia to come in and recreate in a different context the conflicts of the cold war. It is a nutty way to go. It is not the way to chart the future.","[INTERVIEWER]. And in fact, you spoke to the Indian Prime Minister. Did you think that the optimists might have a point when they say that now they've done this test; maybe they'll sign the nonproliferation and the test ban treaties; they just needed to do this. So it's good news? Or is that just whistling in the wind?","Prime Minister Blair. Well, I certainly hope that they are prepared to do that, and there will be very, very strong pressure from the international community for them to come, unconditionally, into both treaties. And I think it's tremendously important they do so. Because as the [INTERVIEWED] was saying, I mean, if we have nuclear proliferation in the world—India—then if Pakistan were again to defy what is a very, very strong plea to them from the rest of the world not to engage in this, then you've got the danger of other states as well. So I mean, we're dealing with extremely serious and threatening present dangers.","Situation in Indonesia","[INTERVIEWER]. What about Indonesia, talking of serious and threatening dangers? I mean, there's not much that could be done, is there? I mean, you've all said you're not going to seek to get rid of Mr. Soeharto, although you probably wouldn't sob if he decided to step down of his own accord. But what is there that the rest of the world can do about a situation like that, or is it an example of where you can do nothing?","Prime Minister Blair. Well, I don't think you can do nothing. We can't interfere in their own internal politics, it is true. But a lot of the discussions that we have had over this past couple of days have been about we bring about greater stability in the financial systems of the world, because the crisis in Asia that has rocked many of the economies there will have an impact right round the world, is already having, may have an even more serious impact in the future. So what we can do is try and devise the right architecture, if you like, for the financial systems of the world which lead to greater stability, more openness, more transparency, and where we keep the advantages of global markets and trade, but try and make sure that that happens within a system that's properly regulated.","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Keep in mind, Indonesia is the fourth or fifth largest country in the world in population. So, even though what we've seen on the television is very troubling, this is a vast country, the largest Muslim country in the world, with a very complex society that has been through a very traumatic several months. And I think it's important to point out that the world community has not been idle. We've been working hard since November—at least since November to try to help Indonesia come out of its economic problems.","But we have felt all along that ultimately, to build a stable modern economy and to avoid this crisis, there would have to be some way for the Government and the [INTERVIEWED] to deal with all elements of society on some sort of democratic basis. And that's what our statement says. So what we want is to see Indonesia come out of this whole and healthy. They should decide the fate of all their leaders; it should be up to the people to decide. But this is not a hopeless situation yet. This is a great country full of talented people with staggering economic achievements in the last 30 years—staggering.","So I think that what we have to do is to hope for the best and try to guard against the worst and keep working with them.","Asian Economies","[INTERVIEWER]. And do you feel—you mentioned there as we led into that, the subject of the Asian situation. [INTERVIEWED], do you feel that the worst is over in the Asian economic crisis, that it's on the mend, or is still on the jaws of——","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. I think it's hard to generalize. I think the Philippines have done very well and a tribute to their leadership. Thailand is doing better. Korea is clearly coming back, which is very good, because it's a big part of the economy. And Malaysia is having a difficult time, but they have a lot of strong economic underpinnings. And Indonesia is the big question. The other thing, of course, is that Japan— Prime Minister Hashimoto is struggling mightily now to put together a package that will restore growth in Japan. If growth comes back to the Japanese economy, that will—because it so dwarfs the others in size, it will cure a lot of these problems.","Prime Minister Blair. I mean, the fundamentals are strong, actually, in the Asian economies, but we've just got to work together to put the right system around it so that both systems are helped.","Third World Debt Relief","[INTERVIEWER]. Does all these other issues mean that you'll make less progress on the whole area of Third World debt at this G-8 than you both hoped, or can you catch up?","Prime Minister Blair. No. I think, in fact, we've had a very good meeting on Third World debt, and we've agreed on a number of specific measures, including greater help for countries, particularly if they're in a post-conflict situation or there's been conflict there, and for the highly indebted countries. Because for many of these countries—in Africa—the [INTERVIEWED] has just been there recently and so knows better than most of us—but there is tremendous potential there. But they're struggling under this huge burden of debt. Often their political systems have been a tremendous handicap to them, but there is progress on the democratic front there. But we've got to give them the help that we can, whilst making sure that we're not just channeling aid, but we're actually making sure that that money, when it goes in, is going to be used properly and where we're trying to alleviate the debt burden so that they can come out of this situation of crisis that they've been in.","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. I think to be fair, when Prime Minister Blair took over the head of the G-8, one of his initiatives was to have the right kind of debt relief. And we have embraced, now for a little more than a year, a strategy for the highly indebted poor countries that says we will—we know we should do debt relief, but it won't do any good unless they do things to help themselves. So we'll have a structured system where we'll give much, much more help to the highly indebted poor countries that actually undertake their own reform, so that we believe the debt relief will actually amount to money being invested in their future in a positive way.","And when I went to Africa, one of the things I saw was the countries with honest governments can channel the energy, the intelligence, the passion of a wonderful people and get a lot done. So I'm more optimistic about Africa than I was before I went there. But I do believe that we should help those who are trying to help themselves.","Prime Minister Blair. It's interesting. It's one of the great lessons of the 20th century that democracy and prosperity in the end go together.","The Euro and the Dollar","[INTERVIEWER]. In terms of prosperity, one lightening question occurs to me. The euro—we're talking about the euro here—what will be the implications of a strong euro on the dollar, [INTERVIEWED]? Could it be bad news for the dollar?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. I don't think so. It could become, some time in the future, an alternative currency. You know, people might trade in the euro as well as the dollar. It could become— a lot of transactions might be done in the euro as well as the dollar. But I don't see that as a threatening thing. I think anything that brings free people closer together and increases prosperity in a democratic way, that makes it more likely to be broadly shared, is positive.","So I think as long as that's what's going on— you know, Europe—a unified Europe, it seems to me, is still committed to freedom, still committed to openness, still committed to a certain generosity of spirit, and I think that has to be good for the world. What we're trying to do, slowly but surely, is to integrate political and economic and social systems of the world not in ways that diminish national sovereignty but that alleviate the problems of the world and enable us to tackle together those things we can't solve alone.","Advice for Prime Minister Blair","[INTERVIEWER]. And you have a great working relationship, the two of you, but one difference between you, of course, is that [INTERVIEWED], you are in your second term and the Prime Minister is early in his first term. What is the most important advice to someone in their first time in order to get into their second term?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Oh, I think he's doing it. I think that—the most important thing I think he can do is to keep the commitments he made in the campaign and to stay in touch with the people and to not be deterred from doing the public's business. You know, people, when they hire you to do these jobs, they want you to work on their affairs. And then when you get in them, there's all sorts of static designed to break your concentration. You have to ignore it and stay at the business.","But I think my advice would be to—he had a very detailed theory about why he wanted to be Prime Minister and where he wanted Great Britain to go, and of course, I have a lot of sympathy with the ideas he put forward, and he's doing a good job of doing what he promised to do. And I think that's the most important thing. And then I think as—the more you get into it, then I think the more you begin to think about what's it going to be like when my children are my age; what's it going to be like when my grandchildren are here. And the more he serves, the more he'll have an impact on that as well.","Northern Ireland Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER]. And along the way, one of the things you've both had to also conquer is to bring up your families under the glare of all that publicity when the children go to school and all of that. But that's fascinating.","Well, at the end of our time, let's return for a moment to where we began. Are you both confident, but not complacent as politicians always say, are you confident that the Northern Ireland people on Friday will take a decision which you believe passionately is the right decision, a positive decision, that they will feel the hand of history on their shoulder? Are you confident about that?","Prime Minister Blair. I mean, I am confident, but I do know that they are considering this really with their heart and their head, and they're going into tremendous detail. And I think that over this next few days it's important that people put their concerns to people like myself and, perhaps, particularly to me and that I answer those concerns, so that people go in and vote yes, in a spirit of real optimism and confidence themselves about the future. And they can do that.","[INTERVIEWER]. And do you have to have, or not— you don't have to have a majority of over 50 percent in each community in Northern Ireland, don't have to have that. Do you want that? Do you need it?","Prime Minister Blair. No, we don't have to have it, but I want as big a vote as possible in both communities. And I want this to be an agreement where we, for once and for all, we get rid of the zero-sum game in Northern Ireland politics which says if one side is happy with something, that means I'm unhappy. Both communities, both traditions, if you like, within Northern Ireland can be satisfied with this, because for the Unionists, the principle of consent is there; for the Nationalist community there is fairness and equity of treatment, the recognition of the Nationalist identity.","That's what this is—you know, I said this on Good Friday after that marathon negotiation we went through, that in the end it's not a fudge, this agreement; it is an historic settlement of Nationalist and Unionist aspirations. And what it means is that in a new world, 2 years off the millennium, where everything is changing around the Republic of Ireland, Europe, Britain, our relations with the rest of the world, where people can argue their case free in the knowledge that they can do so democratically rather than by resorting to violence—now, that's the historic settlement. And that's why I want as many people in both communities to come out and support it.","[INTERVIEWER]. What are your thoughts, [INTERVIEWED]? Are you confident? Can this be a winwin situation for both sides?","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Oh, absolutely. There's no question in my view that, if they vote for the accord, it will turn out to be a win-win. I mean, think about where the world is going to be in 12 years. Just think about 12 years from now—2010. You will have a much more globalized economy; you'll have both Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland more involved in the European economy, more involved in the rest of the world, and more involved with each other, meeting at the tip of Northern Ireland, economically and psychologically, no matter what the legal framework is.","Now, the people that are at that vortex are going to have a very interesting, very rich, very good life if they vote to live it together. If they vote to stay apart, they're still going to be frustrated, distrustful, angry, and a little bit left out. And I think all of us, we have hope and fear inside. I say all the time, we all have little scales inside, and some days we wake up with hope weighing down, some days with fear weighing down. I think on election day the clearheadedness of the Irish people will prevail in Northern Ireland. I think that both communities will go in and vote for the future.","I just ask them to think about what the world will be like, what these islands will be like just 12 years from now, and what they want Northern Ireland to be. We know that democracies of diverse people are interesting places to be when your uniqueness is valued, but you understand that what you have in common as human beings is more important than what divides you. That's a fundamental thing we know. And I believe they'll accept that on election day.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you so much. Because the other part of it is that when Mr. Willy Ross says, or is quoted as saying, \"Look, if there's a no vote, then they'll all just get in and renegotiate it.\" That's not on, is it?","Prime Minister Blair. Well, no. I mean, look, I always say to people, of course, \"We're here, and we'll try and pick up the pieces as best we can.\" But I mean it would be fundamentally wrong to say that to people. We would be in a situation, too, where it wouldn't be the status quo, where actually there is quite a lot of hope about, and people do feel they're making progress. We go backwards.","I mean the one thing I've learned in this whole process is if it doesn't go forward, it goes backwards. It never stays in the same place. So of course, we're the government, we pick up the pieces when everything goes wrong. But I think what the [INTERVIEWED] has just said there, and has said as a visionist, what people can aspire to——","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. And the answer to that is, this agreement—I mean, I can see that even as an outsider—this agreement sets up a framework to embody in a thousand ways the principle of consent. If he doesn't like some detail, then the people will be perfectly free to modify it in the future within the framework of the agreement. So why take the risk that this moment won't present itself again for another generation, when anything that he believes is wrong with it, if he thinks he can persuade a majority he's right, can be modified by the people themselves in the future?","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, both, very much, indeed. Mr. Prime Minister, [INTERVIEWED], thank you so much.","[INTERVIEWED] Clinton. Thank you, David.","Prime Minister Blair. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprimeministertonyblairtheunitedkingdomjohnkingthecablenews","text":["Northern Ireland Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER]. Let me start by thanking both of you for sharing some time on what is obviously a very busy day. We're in the closing days of the campaign for the peace initiative in Northern Ireland, and suddenly there seems to be apprehension, a lot of opposition. You see some slippage in the public opinion polls, the critics saying that you see these people, terrorists, criminals, at rallies being hailed as heroes.","Each of you, if you could share your thoughts on what you think of the tone of the campaign, and do you share that apprehension? And how do you counter the message of those who say, vote no?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think before we get a vote as important as this, there is bound to be a lot of apprehension, consideration by people, and it's right that they treat this seriously, because it affects their future. And one of the fascinating things is there has been very little debate in this referendum campaign about the institutional structure, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the relationship with the Republic of Ireland, because the thing has wrecked every attempt to have a peace agreement in Northern Ireland for the past 50, 60 years. Instead, people are worried, as you say, about things like prisoners.","But as I say to people, when you look at the facts, these guys who were out on the platform the other day under day-release schemes, they were done years ago. The vast majority of prisoners will be out within a few years anyway. And in the end, people have got to look at the package as a whole and say, \"What is the best for the future: to have stability and prosperity and the chance to bring up your children with some prospect of staying in Northern Ireland and doing well, or to slip back into the ways that Northern Ireland knew for decade upon decade of division and bitterness and hatred?\"","[INTERVIEWED]. I think some of the reservation has come from people who wonder: Well, is there some sort of trick here; can somebody have it both ways; can they be part of the political life of the country; and can they sort of condone violence? And I can tell you, at least from America's point of view, the answer to that is no. Anybody who resorts to violence will have no friends in the United States. I don't care what side they're on or what their heritage is or what their previous ties are.","And I think I can speak for the overwhelming majority of Irish-Americans in both the Catholic and Protestant communities, that all we have ever wanted was a just peace. This peace embodies the principle of consent. It gives the Irish people of both traditions the right to chart their future in Northern Ireland and to make of it what they will. I think, if it is embraced, you'll see a big increase in involvement of Irish-Americans and other Americans eager to invest in Northern Ireland, eager to lift prosperity and to show people the benefits of peace.","And so I very much hope that they will take that leap of faith and ask themselves a simple question: What is the downside risk of going forward? It is so much lower than the downside risk of blowing this opportunity.","[INTERVIEWER]. You, at one point, considered visiting at the end of this trip, going to Northern Ireland, to the Republic of Ireland, decided not, perhaps that it would be viewed as meddling. Now in the last 24 to 48 hours, you've decided to speak out again forcefully, publicly. Why did you feel that necessary? And in your view, what role can you play in that process?","And sir, what role do you think the people of Ireland will consider as they listen to the American President?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I decided to speak out because I think that the people of Northern Ireland know that I care a lot about the peace process, that the United States has been involved in it, that we've tried to not only—I think it's important to point out not only has Mr. Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, been to the United States a lot, but I have spent far more time with Mr. Trimble and other leaders, Unionist leaders, than any American President ever has.","I've tried to listen to both sides, to learn, to just encourage them to make their own peace and chart their own future. And so I think it's appropriate for me to speak out. I just was afraid if I went there—I can remember when people from outside used to come to my home State and try to influence elections. It never worked, because in the end voters instinctively know they have to live with the consequences of their decision. So that's different.","But if a journalist like you asks me a question about what I think the arguments are, I think that it's important for me to answer. And I hope that people on all sides of the issue will listen to what I have to say, because at least I have some experience here; I know something about this. I know something about what happened in Bosnia; I know something about what happened in the Middle East; I know something about people who are divided and the difference in peace and war, or peace and sort of purgatory with violence. And peace has unfailingly been better, in the toughest of circumstances.","[INTERVIEWER]. As to people who actually get a vote listen to him, your friend, why should they listen to him?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think people do listen because people know the President is sincere, deeply committed, and actually knowledgeable about what has happened in Northern Ireland. And I can say, right from the time I became Prime Minister, but actually before that when the President visited Northern Ireland in 1995 I think it was, that his visit made a huge impact. People felt that he was someone that understood. Perhaps more than any other American President, people really feel that [INTERVIEWED] both understands, knows, and people, they can also feel his willing them to do well. And I think people certainly will listen to that very much.","[INTERVIEWER]. As you look forward to this vote, take us back if you will. You have described this process as agonizingly difficult. In the last few hours, you had a series of transatlantic conversations yourselves. Mr. President, you were on the phone with Mr. Adams I believe twice, Mr. Trimble at least once, John Hume. Can you take us inside those conversations, pacing, raising your voice? You had people on each side that, \"Nevermind, I can't do this. I'm going to back out.\" How did you keep it together, and how did you interrelate personally as you went through this process?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think it was so much a question of raising our voice or—obviously, these are conversations that you have with people at a particularly difficult moment, and you don't go right back over them the whole time. But I think in many ways what I found was tremendously useful in respect to the President's intervention was that people did and do respect his views on it, because, obviously in part, he's the President of the United States, but actually it's more to do with him personally, having shown commitment all the way through, having listened to all sides in the conflict, and therefore having some standing because of this own personal commitment, some credibility, if you like, to say to people, \"Look, the eyes of the world are upon us. Let's see if we can go for this thing and make it happen.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. And as Thursday night turned to Good Friday, at any point did you think: This isn't going to happen; it's going to collapse?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm afraid I thought that pretty regularly, at about hourly intervals. But in the end—I mean, what always comes back home to me is we're 2 years off the year 2000; there is so much happening in the world, so many changes that I've seen in the last 10 or 15 years of my lifetime. I can't believe 2 years off the millennium that a place like Northern Ireland, which has got this extraordinary potential, where the people are tremendous people, as you know if you've been there, I cannot believe we can't find a way to live with each other 2 years off the new millennium with all the changes in the world, with all the possibilities there are. So even though a lot of the time I was sitting there thinking, \"Can we really make this happen,\" I have a sort of inner optimism about it.","[INTERVIEWER]. And what was your message in those phone calls? You were probably half asleep as you started some of them.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, I just— when I talked to Prime Minister Blair or Prime Minister Ahern or George Mitchell, I was mostly listening. But when I talked to the parties, what I heard from them actually was very like what you're hearing from the general public now. It was sort of the darkness before the dawn. It was like, \"Okay, we made this deal, and oh, there's a few things down the road that we'd like to improve,\" but what they really needed was not me to talk about the specifics; what they really needed was for me to remind them of the big picture, that it was time to join hands and jump off the diving board together and get in the pool and swim to shore.","And I say that not in a disrespectful way but in a respectful way. It's very hard, once you've been estranged from people for a long time, to overcome your fears and distrust. And as I have said repeatedly, I'll never forget Prime Minister Rabin telling me before Israel signed the agreement with the PLO, that everybody was reluctant to do it, but you don't make peace with your friends. You have to make peace with those and then make them your friends, because of the estrangement of the past. That's what I want people to think about.","If every voter in Northern Ireland says, \"What are we going to look like in 2000, and what's it going to look like in 2010,\" Britain here— Mr. Blair is the President of the EU in this cycle. Britain leading the united Europe; Ireland a part of the united Europe with one of the best reforming economies, the Republic of Ireland; Northern Ireland, where Britain and Ireland join in some sort of fashion no matter what decision they make.","Now, they're going to be at the vortex of something very, very big, if they can just liberate themselves it could change the past. They don't have to give up their traditions; they can value them. They've agreed to the principle of consent. They have set up a mechanism by which they can chart their own future. What remains is really just to take the leap of faith and realize that the risk of going forward is infinitesimal, tiny, compared to the risk of letting this opportunity slip away.","Nuclear Proliferation in South Asia","[INTERVIEWER]. We're short on time, so if I could ask each of you in closing, tensions in another part of the world have been a major theme of discussion here at your meeting, the Pakistani Prime Minister today saying he was disappointed in the communique relating to condemning India for the nuclear test. If I could ask each of you your reaction to that and how you see that process going forward in the days ahead.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's a very strong statement in the communique, condemning the Indian nuclear tests and, what's more, putting strong pressure on India to sign up unconditionally for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And I urge Pakistan now, as we all do in our communique, not to follow them down that route because the world is a dangerous enough place as it is, and we fear for the future if these nuclear tests carry on.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first, it's the strongest possible statement we could have gotten. Some of our members are philosophically opposed to the imposition of sanctions under virtually any circumstances. And as you know, the United States, Japan, Canada, perhaps others will follow, did impose economic sanctions. But it's a strong statement. What we have now to do is to build on it. We have to tell the Pakistanis, \"If you're willing to not go down this road, which we believe is a loser, let's work together to try to define a way to protect your security without becoming a nuclear power.\"","And we have to go back to the Indians and say, \"Let's find a way to protect your security and honor the greatness of your democracy without becoming a nuclear power. This is a bad thing, but let's minimize this. This is not a good thing for the world. The Russians and the Americans, we're trying to lower our nuclear arsenals. We're trying to make this problem go away for the world. And we do not need to just have a whole lot of other people with smaller nuclear arsenals on the assumption that they'll never be used. You can't do that.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you both.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprintjournalists","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. I've got a couple of opening comments, and we'll go around the table a couple of times and answer your questions.","First, I'm really looking forward to my trip. We're involved with a lot of interesting initiatives that will help the world grow toward peace and freedom, and this trip will be an opportunity to not only to talk about American values but to talk with friends, allies, important parties about how working together we can achieve grand goals, the goals of peace, the goals of freedom, the goals of hope and prosperity.","I start off in Poland. It's my second trip to Poland since I've been [INTERVIEWED]. I'm going to Krakow; I'm going to Auschwitz. I'm going to give a speech, which I'm still working on right now, but it's a speech that reminds us that together we can achieve the big objective. It's a speech, really, to Europe that says that our common values are strong and that we welcome the emergence of countries like free countries like Poland, and as well as we must be reminded of the lessons of the past.","I'm going to Auschwitz to see firsthand one of the greatest lessons of the past, that there's evil in this world and that the only way to deal with the evil is together. And we did so in the past, and now there's you know, terrorism and killing of innocent people is evil, and we've got to work together to achieve the same objectives that were achieved in the past, and that is peace and freedom.","And then I go on to St. Petersburg to not only honor the great city of St. Petersburg, their 300th anniversary, but also to have an important dialog with Vladimir Putin. It'll be a dialog that will really show the world that in spite of our disagreements over what happened in Iraq, that our relationship is strong and that we can move together in positive ways.","Then I go to the G-8. I know the press corps is going to be you know, they'll be observing the G-8 as a great you know, will this turn into a meeting a confrontational meeting? The answer is absolutely not. It's an opportunity to talk with some who agreed with us on Iraq and some who didn't, about how we move forward. And I've laid the groundwork for the trip by talking about some great goals that wealthy nations can achieve.","One, of course, is to fight AIDS in Africa. Another which is to enhance trade, so that people have a chance to rise out of poverty, and others address famine as well as to continue to keep our focus on dealing with those terrorists who would like to hold the world blackmail the world as well as to kill innocents, take innocent life.","I then go from there to the Middle East. It's going to be a significant visit. One, it says that I am committed to the peace process; that I look forward to working with the new Palestinian leadership as well as Ariel Sharon to make it clear to the world that we have as leaders, we have the intention of working together to achieve peace, that there's a commitment, a personal commitment, not just by me but a personal commitment by Prime Minister Abbas as well was Prime Minister Sharon, to work together to achieve peace; and that there are responsibilities that all of us have as leaders, not only responsibility to the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, not only the responsibility of the Israeli Prime Minister, but a responsibility for the leadership in the Arab world to fight terror, prevent killers from stopping the process from going forward.","And so the first stop will be in Sharm el-Sheikh, in Egypt. I'm really looking forward to the visit. President Mubarak has urged me, consistently urged me to come to Sharm el-Sheikh, and this is my chance to see this spectacular part of Egypt. And that's where I'm going to meet with the Arab leaders, some of the Arab leaders, to talk about shared responsibility. I want them to hear from me firsthand the commitment of the United States of America to move toward peace in the Middle East. And I want them also to hear from me firsthand that I expect them to be partners in the process.","And then I'm going to go to Jordan. Of course, I'll see the King of Jordan. I believe the King is going to be in Sharm el-Sheikh as well. And then I'll have a bilateral meeting with the King. It will give me a chance to thank him for his strong support on the liberation of Iraq. I'm sure he'll want to talk about matters of trade with the United States, and I'll be fully prepared to do so.","And then I'll meet with the Prime Minister of both the Palestinian Authority and of Israel, and I'm looking forward to these meetings. I believe in the possibilities of peace. I trust the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority when he condemns terror. I believe that provides an opening for the United States and others to expend the necessary energies to move the process forward.","I will remind them that I was the first President ever to stand up and say I am for two states, living side by side in peace. And I did so at the United Nations. I still have that vision. I believe it's possible. So I will talk to these two leaders about our mutual desire to move the process forward.","And then I go to Qatar, where I'll meet with General Franks and Jerry Bremer to talk about the reconstruction of Iraq. I'll also meet with Amir of Qatar and then speak to our troops, and head home. And this is a trip I'm looking forward to.","Let me answer some questions. Why don't we start here?","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], obviously your vision and your principles are quite commendable. The trouble is that so many people still have suspicions; they are afraid. Why do you think people remain suspicious and afraid of either your staying power, sir, or whether, you know well, please go ahead and then I'll ask my","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I understand your question. Oftentimes, we live in a processed world you know, people focus on the process and not results. What I'm going to say to people who are suspicious of our motives: Let's work together to achieve positive results.","And I fully understand, for example, the Middle East it's a suspicious world. There are suspicions of motives. And until people see the emergence of a Palestinian state, there will be suspicions; until I can prove for the average Palestinian citizen, there will be suspicions. And so I fully understand the skepticism. I mean, after all, we're dealing in a world where there's a lot of heartbreak, a lot of death, a lot of sorrow, a lack of hope. And until there is noticeable change, there is going to be suspicions.","I've got great confidence in what America stands for. I have said to our country and to the world many times that in order for there to be peace, there must be freedom. And I believe that a free Palestinian Authority and a free Palestinian people will yield to peace in that part of the world. Therefore, we're striving toward the development of such a state. And until people begin to see, however, the results of that vision, people will be skeptical.","And the only thing I can do is to continue to speak out as clearly as I can about the values which motivate our foreign policy and motivate me personally and work hard to achieve results, tangible results. And when people see results, when the people see that the Iraqi people are more free and that their economy begins to develop, when people see that the Iraqi people have control of their own oil for the benefit of the Iraqi people, then some of the suspicions will be turned aside.","I'll never win the hearts of the terrorists, nor am I trying to, because the terrorists have got one thing in mind, murder to stop peace. And it stands in stark contrast to what I believe, which is freedom to bring peace.","So, you know, there are some I would never try to win their hearts and minds over that are absolutely bent upon stopping not only what the United States is trying to do but a lot of other nations as well. So my answer to your question is: I understand skepticism; I understand the attitudes of some; but I refuse to be stopped in my desire to rally the world toward achieving positive results for each individual.","I have said many times that freedom and human dignity is not America's gift to the world; it is the Almighty God's gift to each and every individual. And I firmly believe that. And it's that principle which motivates my desire to see to it that the Palestinian mother or father can raise their child in a comfortable environment, knowing that their child can have a good education and the possibility of a peaceful life.","And I feel the same way about the Israeli citizen who grows up, a child who grows up in an environment where they can go to the market with their mother or father and get blown away. We must stop that kind of violence and provide hope for people.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a followup on the skepticism. Of course there is a lot of concern in the area, over and above the hope, because of your strong commitment. So what do you think will happen if the rush for the settlements continue? And how would it affect your vision of having a Palestinian state with borders and with land, a viable Palestinian state?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I believe that's important that there be a viable Palestinian state. I mean, it is the vision. I believe a viable Palestinian state with the institutions necessary for democracy and freedom to prevail, the institutions bigger than the occupants of the offices which they hold, is very important to gain the confidence not only of the neighborhood, the confidence of the Israelis, the confidence of other Arab nations, but the confidence of the free world as well.","So I believe the emergence of a Palestinian state is very important. I have consistently said that the Israelis are going to have to deal with the settlement issue and that there is a part of the process is going to be a focus on the settlements. I fully understand that settlement expansion is not in concert with the development of a state. And we will deal with that.","And I will also remind everybody, however, that the process in order for the process to go forward, in order for there to be confidence of all parties, there must be an absolute determined effort to fight off terror, to not allow the few to destroy the process. I believe we can make progress, otherwise I wouldn't be going.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. Well, since I'm French, I'll ask you a French question.","[INTERVIEWED]. In French or in American?","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, I'll try to do it in American.  A number of American high officials have repeatedly said that France would have to pay the price for its opposition to your policy in Iraq. So far, we didn't see much as far as reprisals are concerned. Have you forgiven France?","[INTERVIEWED]. I look forward to working with France to achieve common objectives. Listen, let me be realistic. There is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the American people toward the French decision. That's realistic. People didn't understand the decisions by the French leadership to thwart the desire for the American the American desire and the desire of others to work on security and freedom, security for our countries and freedom in Iraq.","However, that's not going to influence my policy. My decision is to go and to say the French Government: Let us work together for a Europe which is whole, free, and at peace, a Europe in which countries are allowed to be friends of the United States and at the same time participate in institutions such as the European Union; that rivalry will end up weakening our efforts to jointly deal with issues like security and peace and AIDS and trade.","So, no, I will have a good discussion with Jacques Chirac, and I'm looking forward to going to the G-8, not only talking to Jacques Chirac; I'll talk with others who have not necessarily agreed with our Iraq policy. We've got a lot of work to do. And I've got work to do to convince the skeptics in France that the intentions of the United States are positive. And the French leadership has got work to do to convince the American people that they are concerned about the security of our country. And I will look forward to conducting that work with Jacques Chirac.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], please allow me in genuine Texan style to grab the bull by the horns.","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's quite obvious that your personal relations with Mr. Putin are much more developed, much more warm than the relations between Russia and the United States.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's interesting.","[INTERVIEWER]. At least there is no Jackson-Vanik amendment between George and Vladimir.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's right.","[INTERVIEWER]. And this situation","[INTERVIEWED]. We need to get rid of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, I want you to know. Make sure the Russian people know that.","[INTERVIEWER]. And this difference between your personal relations and the relations between our countries creates negative feelings in the Russian public opinion and among Russian elites. And that's why I think it somehow hinders President Bush for his in his quest for further democratization and westernization of Russia.","My question is, what do you want to undertake to upgrade the Russian-American relations to the same level as your personal relations with Mr. Putin, including, of course, the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which became in Russia, unfortunately, the litmus paper of our relations?","[INTERVIEWED]. Right.","[INTERVIEWER]. And by the way, our Russian Jews are a little bit indignant that they are replaced by the American chicken. And instead of, \"Let my people go,\" now they say, \"Let our chicken come.\" And we don't understand in Russia how the genuine American eagle can defeat an artificial American chicken.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, at least we're arguing about chickens and not about whether or not we've got enough missiles pointed at each other.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. By the way, [INTERVIEWED], before you start answering my question, you can already do something in improving our relations. I brought two books. If you sign them, you will improve the relations. It is for my","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay. I'm certainly not going to try to influence your story.","[INTERVIEWER]. Oh, no, no for my Presidential library, which has all the signed books and pictures of all American Presidents, beginning with Eisenhower and, of course, your highly esteemed father.","[INTERVIEWED]. You don't look that old.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, I'm 75.","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay, well, you're a young 75. Thank you, sir, for your question.","First of all, Vladimir Putin and I do have a good relationship. And that is an important beginning in order to make sure the relationship is positive throughout our respective Governments. If we had a poisonous relationship, it would be awfully difficult to convince others in our Governments to work closely together. And so that's a positive beginning.","Secondly, I did take note that the Moscow Treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both Houses in the Duma. That's a positive sign. As a matter of fact, if you think back, people if you put this in historical context, this treaty is pretty darn good progress early in our respective administrations. I mean, it happened quickly, which is a positive sign. In other words, Vladimir and I made the decision that we'll work together to create better conditions and make the world a more peaceful place.","One way to enhance relations between our Governments is to have a meaningful and real strategic dialog throughout our entire Government on key matters, so that the participants in both our Governments recognize that we are willing to not only share information but to deal with issues before they become problems and to work together in a collaborative way to show the world that we can handle and deal with some of the large issues, such as proliferation, for example.","So therefore, we've got Spence Abraham, our Secretary of Energy, working very closely with his counterpart. Secretary Veneman has got a task force set up to work very Agriculture Secretary to work very closely with her counterpart not only on chickens, but on other issues dealing with our farm communities.","This dialog, this kind of strategic framework was initiated at my request and I think at Vladimir's request as well. But Condi, when she went over to Russia, began the setting in place this capacity for our two Governments to relate on a variety of issues in a consistent way.","Now, I agree with Vladimir, we need to get rid of Jackson-Vanik, and have talked to our some of the folks on the Hill to deal with this issue. And I would like to get rid of Jackson-Vanik. I think it's an important symbol to say to the Russian people, \"The past is over. Now we move forward in a positive relationship.\"","Yes, sir.","Roles of NATO and the United Nations","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a very quick question. What role, if any, you foresee for international organizations like the U.N. or NATO in the future, for instance, in the war against terrorism and any other international conflict?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, good question. NATO I see a robust role for NATO, which says that NATO must reform herself. NATO has got to be a military collaboration that is modern, that can move quickly, that's got the newest weapons. I will speak to NATO when I go to Poland. It's part of my speech in Krakow. And it's I'm a strong advocate of NATO. As you know, I, with Warsaw, talked about the expansion of NATO, which, thankfully, came to fruition and had been ratified the expansion has been ratified in our United States Senate, overwhelmingly so.","NATO is now its vision is beyond the old days of when the Soviet Union posed a threat to Europe. NATO is now willing to take on new assignments, all aimed at creating the same conditions of the past, in other words, a peaceful and free world. And that's why NATO is now in Afghanistan. I welcome that.","NATO will play a supportive role for Poland in Iraq. I want to thank the Polish people for their and the Government for sending, I believe, 8,000 or 9,000 troops to run a sector in Iraq. And NATO has agreed to help in that sector, help the Polish troops. I think that my point to you is NATO is becoming more modern, and a more modern NATO is going to be very useful for dealing with the true threats that we face in the 21st century.","In terms of the United Nations, it's going to be important for all of us to work to keep the United Nations a strong and viable institution. And I think a useful dialog at some point in time will be how to make sure the United Nations has adapted to the threats we face.","Obviously, it was a frustrating experience to have gone to the United Nations and spent a lot of time and a lot of debate on whether or not United Nations resolutions should be upheld. I believe they should. I believe in this world, when you say something, you'd better mean it. And I gave the speech, as you might remember, on September the 12th, 2002, in the United Nations, the day after the anniversary of the attacks on our country. And I said to the United Nations, \"You have passed resolution after resolution after resolution\" I think is said it 12 times and my point was, \"Do you mean it?\"","And my answer in a rhetorical if that's a rhetorical question, my answer to you is, I hope they mean it, because I want the United Nations to be an effective body. However, its effectiveness is undermined when they say something and nothing happens. And therefore, we've got to, all of us who care about the United Nations, must figure out how to make it effective in the future.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if you would permit me a couple of detailed questions.","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure. Do I need to write these down, because my memory is getting somewhat .","Iraq","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm getting that too.","Sir, on the issue of Iraq, it looks like a messy situation. Security is not established. Are you worried about a lengthy American-British occupation of Iraq? And on the Palestinian issue","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me answer that one first.","[INTERVIEWER]. Then will you permit me the Palestinian question?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. And that you admitted you've got a flawed memory like I do.","First of all, you made a broad statement, \"the security situation,\" as if all of Iraq is there's lawlessness in all of Iraq. That's simply not the case. A lot of Iraq is improving from the pre-war conditions, and that's important to know.","Now, there's no question that there's lawlessness inside of Baghdad, for example, and regions north of Baghdad. And we are dealing with that. And we will deal with that for the sake of the Iraqi people, who want most first and foremost, to have a secure life, food on the table, lights in their house, running water, sewage that works. They want the conditions of life that everybody yearns for, which is a comfortable lifestyle so their families can be secure. They want to work. And we're making progress on all fronts.","I fully understand the degree of difficulty, and it's created by the fact that these people have been enslaved by a torturous ruler for many, many years. And therefore, I don't expect the conditions to improve automatically after 70 days. And it's going to take a while.","And therefore, to answer your question I don't view it as an occupation, by the way. I view it as a group of nations. You said \"British and Americans.\" There are many, many nations who are involved in the contribution of help so that the Iraqi people are able to establish their own Government and have comfortable lives and can be a free society. And it's going to take a while.","And I remind you that it's like the writing of the Constitution. America, after our revolution, did not write its Constitution overnight. As a matter of fact, it probably took, what, 11 years or so. From the Articles of Confederation to the United States Constitution took 11 years. We live in a world now where everything has to happen yesterday.","Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. Thirteen.","[INTERVIEWED]. What?","Press Secretary Fleischer. Thirteen.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thirteen years. My man corrected I'm sorry. He won't be correcting me much longer. He'll be a pundit. Don't worry, he will be correcting me, but on TV. Get him on your TV show.","Anyway, 13 years, as my man corrected me.","The process will take a while. I am in touch with Jerry Bremer. I mentioned to you that I will see him when I go over to Qatar. We get a report all the time. And we are making progress, slowly but surely. And that's and it makes sense, given the conditions.","And it's important we succeed. And so, therefore, our coalition of a lot of countries will stay the course, until such time as the Iraqi people the life is improved and the Iraqi people would be in a position to, you know, run themselves. Freedom is going to be a beautiful thing in this part of the world. It's a very powerful sentiment that I believe all people feel.","And therefore, one of our ambitions and one of our values is to create the conditions necessary for the Iraqi people to run their own Government. And you'll see over time here that they'll be getting a group of people will be coming together to write a constitution. And you know, it'll be a constitution written by the Iraqis, for the Iraqis, and of the Iraqis. And we believe that's possible.","Now, look, I recognize there are some in the world who say Iraq can't run themselves. I refuse to condemn people. I mean, \"They need a dictatorship in order for the country to survive.\" Forget it. I don't believe that. It's just not in my makeup. That's just not what I think. I think people I think the Iraqi people are plenty competent about running themselves. It's just going to take a while to go from a society in which one person dominated and killed and murdered people in order to stay in power.","I mean, we've discovered an unbelievable amount of graves. And by the way, we've discovered weapons manufacturing facilities that were condemned by the United Nations; biological laboratories described by our Secretary of State to the whole world, that were not supposed to be there, in direct violation of the U.N. resolution, have been discovered.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks for giving me a chance to say that, so the American press, in particular, could hear it off the record, of course.","Palestinian Authority/Middle East Terrorists","[INTERVIEWER]. Sir, on the Palestinian issue, what if the government of Mr. Abbas really becomes unable no matter how much it puts up an effort to produce eliminating these operations, the suicide bombings what if he fails? Is this a failure of the peace process, of the roadmap? Would you then give it up? And then can you afford, really, sir, to pressure Mr. Ariel Sharon in a pre-reelection stage? Can you really do that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course I can. I don't know about listen, if I were afraid of making the decisions necessary, for political reasons, to move the process forward, I wouldn't be going. I believe peace is possible, and I believe that I have a responsibilities, now that the conditions are such, to move the process forward.","And what are those conditions? Well, there's a new Palestinian leader who is openly, firmly committed to fighting terror. And I believe he can be successful, particularly when the Arab world helps him. I believe the conditions are such that people are so sick and tired of a hopeless situation in that part of the world that together we can defeat the forces of terror and dismantle the forces of terror.","That's not to say that a suicider could slip through, and it's possible, but we will not allow the evil designs of a few to stop the process that can provide such hope for a lot of people. So I believe, with the right effort and the right focus and the leadership, not only of the United States and Israel and the Palestinian Authority but the leadership of Egypt and Saudi Arabia and other nations of concern, Jordan, that we can defeat terror, the forces of terror that would like to stop the process.","Yes, ma'am.","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay. [INTERVIEWED], you mentioned today that you want to have commitment from the parties about the peace process. Do you want to have, like, concrete steps? Are you going to ask them for concrete steps, like what?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well","[INTERVIEWER]. And","[INTERVIEWED]. Pardon me, sorry to interrupt you. Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. And then in Sharm el-Sheikh, what do you want what do you look to get from the Arabs? And you are meeting with President Mubarak also. Would it include something bilateral or","[INTERVIEWED]. Sure.","[INTERVIEWER]. And what kind?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, listen, President Mubarak and I have had a lot of meetings and a lot of conversations. And I'm confident that he will bring up bilateral relations. As you know, we've got a very strong commitment to Egypt, particularly a funding commitment. And we want to look forward to a I will talk to him about economic reforms. And there's no telling what he'll talk to me about. We've got such a good relationship that he doesn't need to pre-clear it with anybody. He can say what's on his mind. I'll be glad to visit with him about it.","Yes, I mean, first of all, we have a road-map which talks about specific things people need to do. The most constructive thing that the Arab nations can do is to stop funding terrorism to the extent that is to stop the funding of terrorism, make sure you get that right is the work to cut off monies to terrorists whose design it is to stop any peace process. And that's important. To me, that's the most fundamental task.","Secondly, as conditions improve, it would be very helpful if those in the neighborhood provide financial resources to help the economy of a new Palestinian state begin to grow. It's going to be very difficult for a Palestinian state to emerge unless there's economic activity.","I recently met with the finance minister of the Palestinian Authority, was very impressed by his grasp of finances, by the fact that he believes that in order for there to be confidence amongst the Palestinians and confidence in the world that they've got to fight corruption. Listen, stories used to emerge out of the in the old days, of the Palestinian Authority that much of the aid went to enhance a few, as opposed to the people. And I don't stand for that, at least from American perspective. We're not going to let corrupt elites take aid that's supposed to go help the people.","And so when the institutions evolve and confidence emerges that the develop aid will go to help the Palestinian people, which I want it to do, that will be a useful role for the Arab world. And I look forward to working with them on it. But the main thing is for them to see me and my commitment to the process. And it's one thing to read about it in stories; it's another thing to look a person in the eye and tell them, \"Let's work together.\" And that's what I'm looking forward to doing.","I've got very good relations with President Mubarak and Crown Prince Abdullah and the King of Jordan, Gulf Coast countries. I've worked very closely with them. And a lot of them ask me, \"Well, are you going to move forward now that there's a new Palestinian Authority, a leader of the Palestinian Authority, somebody that\" you see, the old leader of the Palestinian Authority is somebody who had a chance to lead and didn't. He has been in power a long time, and the life of the Palestinian people have gotten worse, not better. I remember what happened at Camp David during the tenure of my predecessor. It was a good lesson.","So I've always said, we need to be able to work with somebody who is committed to peace. And I believe the new Prime Minister is committed to peace. And therefore, I want to share that with the leaders.","Israeli Security/Conditions for the Peace Process","[INTERVIEWER]. Sir, can you assure that the other party is committed without reservations?","[INTERVIEWED]. The Israelis? Yes, I believe","[INTERVIEWER]. Without reservations. It's a big problem to the Palestinians now.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, there's a reservation, and there should be a reservation of all parties, and that is the reservation of security. In other words, people aren't going to go forward with a process unless there is a full commitment to enhance the security of all people. And remember, terrorist killers not only affect the security of the Israelis; they affect the security of the Palestinian people. You can't have a Palestinian state if people continue to blow up the process.","And therefore, it's in all our interest to work together on security. And I'm convinced that as the area becomes more secure, as the institutions necessary for a democracy to emerge, that we'll have a positive partner in Israel. I believe that. I believe they want peace. Most Israelis understand two states, side by side in peace, is in their national interest.","And so I think the ingredients for peace are very possible. But you say, \"Are there conditions?\" You bet. There's conditions, of course. And the conditions are to work together to stop the killers from stopping the process, and I share that condition too. And I suspect a lot of the Arab leaders share that condition as well, because they fully understand the consequences of terrorist groups of taking innocent life.","Yes, sir.","Press Secretary Fleischer. Make this the last question.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll answer shorter.","[INTERVIEWER]. All right. So, 30 years ago","[INTERVIEWED]. Somebody very important, very important is waiting.","Group of Eight","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay. Thirty years ago, the G-7 or G-8","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, it's only Condi. Well, I take it back.","Dr. Rice. Your TV people.","[INTERVIEWED]. That's later. Later.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thirty years ago, the G-7 or G-8 summit was set up to coordinate the big powers","[INTERVIEWED]. It wasn't 30 years ago, was it? Twenty","[INTERVIEWER]. Twenty-five or","[INTERVIEWED]. Whatever.","[INTERVIEWER]. He'll know.","Press Secretary Fleischer. Twenty-seven point two.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well done. They were set up to coordinate the big powers, the economic strategists.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Given the risk of deflation, will there be such a concerted plan in Evian? Or will it be everyone for himself, with the U.S. capitalizing on the slide of the dollar?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, that's a great question. It is very important that we do spend time talking about our respective economies. It is essential that the G-8 meeting remember why it was first started, because much of it many of the grand goals that we have, together, are very difficult to achieve if the economies, our respective economies, aren't strong.","You just heard me talk about a hopeful Palestinian state will require trade and commerce. And if the wealthier nations aren't generating cashflow and the capacity to be able to trade with other countries, then it's going to be difficult to achieve our goals.","And so, absolutely, I will tell them that here at home we are have got sound monetary and fiscal policies. After all, I just signed a tax bill yesterday that will cut the taxes by $350 billion, which will help energize growth here in America. I will reiterate our strong dollar policy. I will talk to listen to their plans and initiatives to reform their economies.","I had a very good discussion with Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan about economic matters. We want the Japanese economy to be strong. As a matter of fact, we want the European economies to be strong. We want there to be vibrant growth. It is more likely somebody in America will be able to find a job if our closest trading partners have got vibrant economies.","So we need to spend a lot of time on this subject. And I will remind them that we have a great opportunity on the next round of the World Trade Organization to advance a free trade agenda, which I believe will make it more likely people in our respective countries can work. But it will make it more likely that nations will be able to rise out of poverty. And so, yes, it's a very good question. And we will focus on the economy.","France-U.S. Relations","[INTERVIEWER]. Just a followup, if I may.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes","[INTERVIEWER]. You got rid of the policy that","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm a patient man.","[INTERVIEWER]. reprises against the French","[INTERVIEWED]. My whole family laughed when they heard that. Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]. You didn't exactly answer the question.","[INTERVIEWED]. Especially my daughters.","I answered the question. I look forward to","[INTERVIEWER]. The reprisals on the French.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I answered it. You see what do you mean, didn't exactly answer the question? You've got my answer on your tape machine.","[INTERVIEWER]. So were reprisals?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, you've got my answer on the tape machine. It's an old trick they use in the American press corps too, \"You didn't answer my question.\" What are you talking about? I spent 15 minutes answering your question. You might not like the answer but, nevertheless, I did answer it, absolutely answered it. And I loved the question. I look forward to working with the French.","Russia, NATO, and the World Trade Organization","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], do you visualize Russia as a member of the World Trade Organization, and in the future, the member of the NATO?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that the question on NATO is a question that will be answered over time, but first things first. Let's deal with the framework we've now set up, which is a great advance and a tribute to Vladimir Putin's leadership and our NATO leader's desire to have a unique relationship with Russia.","In terms of the WTO, it is in our national interest that Russia join the WTO. And Russia is going to have to make some internal decisions as to whether or not they're willing to conform to the guidelines of the WTO. But we I strongly support Russia's admission in the WTO.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, sir. Thank you. Do you see the issue of restitution of Jewish property as a problem in Polish-American relations? And will you talk about this in","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, it has not made it to it hasn't made it to my desk. And so, therefore, if it is a problem, it is a problem that hasn't been brought to my attention. In other words, a lot of Polish Americans have yet to express themselves to the point where it has become an issue here in the White House.","I think it's very important let me speak to the broader issue of Jewish relations around the world. It is very important for all of us to reject anti-Semitism wherever it is found, just like it's very important for us to reject those who condemn Islam. Our Nation is one that believes in freedom of religion, and we respect and tolerate people's religious faiths, no matter what their faith.","And so my greater concern about Judaism and Europe is that society resist and thwart a culture which would tolerate any kind of antireligious fervor, anti-Semitism, or an anti-Islamic bent. In other words, one of the things I did I thought was most important was right after September 11th, went to a Islamic center here. I wanted to send a signal that the evil people who hijacked a great religion should not condemn that religion. In other words, Americans shouldn't hold Islam accountable for the deaths.","And so one of the things we believe here in America is religious tolerance. And I will continue to speak out on religious tolerances in a clear fashion.","As I said, I'm going to Auschwitz for a reason. I want to go I want to see Auschwitz. I've studied a lot of history. I've been told it's a powerful experience. But I also want to send a clear signal that all of us must work together to make sure that kind of evil never happens again to anybody.","At any rate, I'm looking forward to going. I want to thank you all for your interest. Very good interview. Pass those books over here.","22d Amendment","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED]?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. What do you think about a third presidential term in the United States?","[INTERVIEWED]. Against it. I'm only supportive of a second term these days.","NOTE: The interview was taped at 10:11 a.m. on May 29 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for later broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on May 30.

{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithprogressivebloggers","text":["[INTERVIEWED]: Well, listen, I know we've got limited time, so I'm not going to give a long speech on the front end.","I thank you guys for coming in. Obviously a huge part of my base reads you guys, cares about what you do. The staff does as well. I think that what the blogosphere has done is to create a conversation that encourages activism across our citizenry, and I think that's absolutely crucial.","We benefit from the constructive feedback and criticism that we get, and it helps hold us accountable. But you guys obviously have also done a great job holding the mainstream press accountable, and that's really important to us.","So I'm glad that I've got time to sit down with you guys. This is completely open, so you guys can take it wherever you want. And what I'll do is I'll just go down the line, everybody gets a question, and then we can just mix it up. How does that sound?","[INTERVIEWER]: Sounds great.","[INTERVIEWED]: Sounds good? All right. John, we'll start with you.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thanks for having us here, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] . Just to start off, because the news of the day is obviously what just happened in Kentucky. What's your feelings on the thought of a Rand Paul supporter actually stepping on the neck of a female MoveOn supporter?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, look, I think that one of the things that I've always tried to promote is civility in politics. I think we can disagree vigorously without being disagreeable. And what we saw on the video was an example of people's passions just getting out of hand in ways that are disturbing.","In fairness, I don't expect every candidate to be responsible for every single supporter's actions, but I do think that all of us have an obligation to set a tone where we say the other side is — may be wrong but it's not evil, because when you start going down that path of demonizing folks, then these kinds of incidents are more likely to occur. And my expectation in the remainder of this campaign is that all candidates out there are a little more careful about making sure that they're framing the debate around issues and sending a clear message to their supporters that our democracy works when we disagree, we debate, we argue, it gets contentious, but that there are certain lines we don't cross.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , you've said that you want to work with Republicans after the election, but there's probably a pretty good chance that they're not going to advance with you. Is there sort of a breaking point you have of where you try to work with them and they just refuse to budge, which they've indicated so far? Is there a breaking point for you just like you're going to have to go off on your own and find a way around them?","[INTERVIEWED]: Look, the — I'm a pretty stubborn guy when it comes to, on the one hand, trying to get cooperation. I don't give up just because I didn't get cooperation on this issue; I'll try the next issue. If the Republicans don't agree with me on fiscal policy, maybe they'll agree with me on infrastructure. If they don't agree with me on infrastructure, I'll try to see if they agree with me on education.","So I'm just going to keep on trying to see where they want to move the country forward.","In that sense, there's not a breaking point for me. There are some core principles that I think are important for not just me to stick with but for the country to stick with. So if the Republicans say we need to cut our investments in education, at a time when we know that our success as a nation is largely going to depend on how well trained our workforce is, I'm going to say no. And there are going to be areas where, after working very hard, we just can't find compromise and I'm going to be standing my ground, then essentially we debate it before the American people.","But I don't go into the next two years assuming that there's just going to be gridlock. We're going to keep on working to make sure that we can get as much done as possible because folks are hurting out there. What they're looking for is help on jobs, help on keeping their homes, help on sending their kids to college. And if I can find ways for us to work with Republicans to advance those issues, then that's going to be my priority.","[INTERVIEWER]: Along those lines, Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , on the economy, we do have 9.6 unemployment; economic projections aren't looking very positive from anybody, with the ongoing foreclosure crisis, as you suggested. Can we expect further initiatives coming out of the administration and maybe Congress post-election?","[INTERVIEWED]: Absolutely. We can't stop. A concern I have right now is that the main economic idea that the Republicans seem to have is continuing the tax cuts for the top 2 percent, and then a vague statement about cutting spending without identifying what those spending cuts might actually be. And I don't know any economists who would say that's a recipe for more job creation.","We have to deal with our debt and we have to deal with our deficits in a responsible way. As you know, most of the problem with our debt and deficits is structural and has to do with the medium and long term. So my hope is, is that we can find a sensible way to deal with it that doesn't squelch economic growth, because a single-point increase in economic growth actually has as much impact on the debt and deficits as all of the Bush tax cuts. I mean, it's trillions of dollars over the life of the economy. And so we've got to emphasize economic growth.","Now, we were successful in reversing our descent into a depression. The Recovery Act worked in stopping the freefall. We followed up with that with everything from a package to cut taxes for small businesses to providing additional assistance to states so that they could keep teachers and firefighters and police officers on the job.","I've already put forward proposals for infrastructure, which I think can have a huge long-term ramification — putting people back to work right now, doing the work that America needs done, laying the foundation for long-term competitiveness.","I think that there may be additional ideas that traditionally have garnered some bipartisan support that we can move forward on. But the point that you're making I think is really important. Yes, people are concerned about debt and deficit. But the single thing people are most concerned about are jobs. And those jobs are going to come from the private sector. We're not going to be able to fill the hole of 8 million jobs that were lost as a consequence of the economic crisis just through government spending, but we can strategically help jumpstart industries. We can make a difference on clean energy. We can make a difference on getting businesses to invest in 2011 as opposed to deferring until 2012 or '13 or '14.","And there should be ways that we can come to some agreement with Republicans if their focus is in fact on improving the lives of the American people as opposed to just positioning for the next election.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mine is an easy question. Will you rule out raising the retirement age to 70?","[INTERVIEWED]: We are awaiting a report from the deficit commission, or deficit reduction commission, so I have been adamant about not prejudging their work until we get it.","But I think you can look at the statements that I've made in the past, including when I was campaigning for the presidency, that Social Security is something that can be fixed with some modest modifications that don't impose hardships on beneficiaries who are counting on it.","And so the example that I used during the campaign was an increase in the payroll tax, not an increase — let me scratch that. Not an increase in the payroll tax but an increase in the income level at which it is excluded.","And so what I've been clear about is, is that I've got a set of preferences, but I want the commission to go ahead and do its work. When it issues its report, I'm not automatically going to assume that it's the right way to do things. I'll study it and examine it and see what makes sense.","But I've said in the past, I'll say here now, it doesn't strike me that a steep hike in the retirement age is in fact the best way to fix Social Security.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you. I was glad to hear that you and your staff appreciate constructive feedback.","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes, that's something we enjoy.","[INTERVIEWER]: We've been more than willing to offer that. We've certainly been more than willing to offer than from AMERICAblog, particularly on issues related to the LGBT community, which, you know, there is a certain amount of disillusionment and disappointment in our community right now.","And one of the things I'd like to ask you — and I think it's a simple yes or no question too — is do you think that \"don't ask, don't tell\" is unconstitutional?","[INTERVIEWED]: It's not a simple yes or no question, because I'm not sitting on the Supreme Court. And I've got to be careful, as [INTERVIEWED] of the United States, to make sure that when I'm making pronouncements about laws that Congress passed I don't do so just off the top of my head.","I think that — but here's what I can say. I think \"don't ask, don't tell\" is wrong. I think it doesn't serve our national security, which is why I want it overturned. I think that the best way to overturn it is for Congress to act. In theory, we should be able to get 60 votes out of the Senate. The House has already passed it. And I've gotten the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say that they think this policy needs to be overturned — something that's unprecedented.","And so my hope and expectation is, is that we get this law passed. It is not just harmful to the brave men and women who are serving, and in some cases have been discharged unjustly, but it doesn't serve our interests — and I speak as Commander-in-Chief on that issue.","Let me go to the larger issue, though, Joe, about disillusionment and disappointment. I guess my attitude is that we have been as vocal, as supportive of the LGBT community as any [INTERVIEWED] in history. I've appointed more openly gay people to more positions in this government than any [INTERVIEWED] in history. We have moved forward on a whole range of issues that were directly under my control, including, for example, hospital visitation.","On \"don't ask, don't tell,\" I have been as systematic and methodical in trying to move that agenda forward as I could be given my legal constraints, given that Congress had explicitly passed a law designed to tie my hands on the issue.","And so, I'll be honest with you, I don't think that the disillusionment is justified.","Now, I say that as somebody who appreciates that the LGBT community very legitimately feels these issues in very personal terms. So it's not my place to counsel patience. One of my favorite pieces of literature is \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" and Dr. King had to battle people counseling patience and time. And he rightly said that time is neutral. And things don't automatically get better unless people push to try to get things better.","So I don't begrudge the LGBT community pushing, but the flip side of it is that this notion somehow that this administration has been a source of disappointment to the LGBT community, as opposed to a stalwart ally of the LGBT community, I think is wrong.","All right, now, at this point we can just open it up. I just wanted to make sure everybody got at least one question, and then you guys can —","[INTERVIEWER]: I have one. Crooks and Liars, we're very proactive for the Latino community and rights, for immigration reform. And you've just gone on Spanish radio and said how we need comprehensive immigration reform. I guess I have two points. One is, will you — how far will you go on helping to get the DREAM Act passed? Because it's very important. And also — and it's been mentioned in these questions — with the conservative movement not governing to us appears — as far as helping the American people more on ideology — how do you expect or hope to get conservatives onboard with truly doing immigration reform?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, look, this is a challenge. I mean, right now, I'll be honest, we are closer to getting the votes for \"don't ask, don't tell\" than we are for getting the votes for comprehensive immigration reform. That's a reversal from four years ago when you had John McCain and Ted Kennedy cosponsoring comprehensive immigration reform.","The center of gravity within the Republican Party has shifted. And so out of the 11 Republicans who are still in the Senate who voted for comprehensive immigration reform, I don't know that any of them came out in favor publicly of comprehensive immigration reform during the course of the last couple of years.","And that's a problem, because unfortunately we now have essentially a 60-vote requirement on every single issue, including trying to get judges confirmed who've passed through the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous basis.","Having said that, I think the logic behind comprehensive immigration reform is sufficiently compelling that if we are making the case forcefully — that we've increased border security, we have more Border Patrols down on the border than we've ever had before, we've got more resources being devoted to enforcement than before — and yet the problem continues, that means that we've got to try something different.","And that involves, on the one hand, being serious about border security, but it also involves being serious about employers and making sure that they're not exploiting undocumented workers, and it means getting the 10 to 12 million people who are in the shadows out of the shadows and giving them an opportunity to get right by the law so that we can create an orderly process in which this is still a nation of immigrants and it's a nation of laws.","So I'm going to keep pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. It is going to continue to be a priority of my administration. I'm going to try to make the case to Republicans and to the American people that it's the right thing to do.","The DREAM Act is one component of it that I've been a strong supporter of. I was a sponsor — a cosponsor of the DREAM Act when I was in the Senate, and what I told Piolin when I was on his radio show, and what I've said repeatedly, is that my strong preference is to do a comprehensive piece of legislation. But I'm going to consult with immigrants' rights groups and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. If they see an opportunity for us to get the DREAM Act and they think this is something we should go ahead and do now and that it doesn't endanger the possibilities of getting comprehensive immigration reform, the other components of it, down the road, then that's something I'll consider. But my goal right now is to do a broader approach that allows everybody to get out of the shadows, paying their taxes, and contributing to our society.","[INTERVIEWER]: Mr. [INTERVIEWED] , you're often pressured from both the left and right on one issue or another, and then even within the Democratic Party you get pressured from the more conservative, more progressive side of the party. So I'm curious, you sort of govern as a — sort of as a pragmatist, and I'm wondering if you view yourself as a progressive.","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I mean, the problem with labels is everybody thinks they mean different things. So I would define myself as a strong progressive in the sense that I believe in that essential American Dream that everybody gets a chance to make it if they're willing to work hard, that government has a role to play in ensuring opportunity by making sure kids get a decent education and can afford to go to college; that workers are able to train and retrain for the jobs of the future; that we're building strong infrastructure; that we are using our diplomacy alongside our military to protect our national security; that we believe in the Bill of Rights and we actually act on it, even when it's inconvenient; that we are promoting the equal treatment of citizens under the law.","Those core beliefs that America prospers not just when a few people do well but when everybody has the chance to do well, when we've got a growing middle class, where we — people are able to live out their dreams without the barriers of race or gender or sexual orientation, those are things I deeply believe in.","In that sense, though, I think Abraham Lincoln was a progressive. He was a Republican. He was the first Republican [INTERVIEWED] . And that just gives you a sense of how these categories change so much.","It used to be that the values I just described had a home in the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. I think it's only been in recent years that you can't find that articulation of some of these values in the Republican Party, and that in fact if you champion them that you're considered some wild-eyed radical. That's a shift, and not a good shift, in terms of our public debate.","[INTERVIEWER]: I was wondering if you're happy with the federal response to the foreclosure crisis or if you think there's more that either should have been or could be in the future done either through HAMP or Fannie and Freddie or various mechanisms?","[INTERVIEWED]: I don't think I'm happy with millions of foreclosures or millions of houses being underwater. This is — this was both a powerful symptom as well as a cause of the economic crisis that we're in. So we've got to do as much as we can to stabilize the housing market.","I do think that the steps that we've taken helped stabilize the housing market. The HAMP program has gotten a lot of criticism, but the fact of the matter is, is that you've got half a million people who have gone through permanent loan modifications that are saving 500 bucks a month. And I get letters every day from people whose homes were saved as a consequence of it.","I think that the broader steps we took to stabilize the economy mean that housing prices are not plummeting the way they were.","But this is a multitrillion-dollar market and a multitrillion-dollar problem. And the challenge that we've had is we've got only so much gravel and we've got a really big pothole. We can't magically sort of fix a decline in home values that's so severe in some markets that people are $100,000 to $150,000 underwater.","What we can do is to try to create sort of essentially bridge programs that help people stabilize, refinance where they can, and in some cases not just get pummeled if they decide that they want to move.","I think that we have tinkered with the HAMP program as we get more information to figure out can we do this better, can we do this smarter with the resources that we have.","The biggest challenge is how do you make sure that you are helping those who really deserve help and if they get some temporary help can get back on their feet, make their payments and move forward and stay in their home, versus either people who are speculators, own second homes that they really couldn't afford because they'd gotten a subprime loan, and people who through no fault of their own just can't afford their house anymore because of the change in housing values or their incomes don't support it.","And we're always trying to find that sweet spot to use as much of the money that we have available to us to help those who can be helped, without wasting that money on folks who don't deserve help. And that's a tough balance to strike.","I had a meeting with Warren Buffett in my office and his basic point was there was a lot of over-building for a long period of time. Now there's under-building because all that backlog of inventory is being absorbed. Some of that is just going to take time. And we can do as much as we can to help ease that transition, but we're not going to be able to eliminate all the pain because we just don't have the resources to do it. The market is just too big.","The other aspect of the housing market that is worth bearing in mind is that whereas initially a lot of the problems on the foreclosure front had to do with balloon payments people didn't see coming, adjustable rate mortgages that people didn't clearly understand, predatory lending scams that were taking place — now the biggest driver of foreclosure is unemployment. And so the single most important thing I can do for the housing market is actually improve economic growth as a whole. If we can get the economy moving stronger, if we can drive the unemployment rate down, that will have probably the biggest impact on foreclosures, as well as housing prices, as just about anything.","[INTERVIEWER]: I want to go back to the idea of working with Republicans. And given the comments from McConnell and — well, all of them — I think that what a lot of people find frustrating is that our side compromises and continues to compromise just to get that one Republican on. We're going to get one of the Maine twins — whatever. And it doesn't happen, and then by the time health care or whatever goes through we've compromised; we still don't get any Republicans.","I don't anticipate this changing in the next two years. I think it's going to get worse. How are you going to get Democrats to understand that compromise means the other side has to give something sometimes, one day?","[INTERVIEWED]: Look, obviously I share your frustrations. I've got to deal with this every day.","[INTERVIEWER]: Well, I don't expect you to talk like a blogger. [laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]: But I guess I'd make two points. The first is, I'm [INTERVIEWED] and not king. And so I've got to get a majority in the House and I've got to get 60 votes in the Senate to move any legislative initiative forward.","Now, during the course — the 21 months of my presidency so far, I think we had 60 votes in the Senate for seven months, six? I mean, it was after Franken finally got seated and Arlen had flipped, but before Scott Brown won in Massachusetts. So that's a fairly narrow window. So we're right at the number, and that presumes that there is uniformity within the Democratic caucus in the Senate — which, Barbara, you've been around a while. You know that not every Democrat in the Democratic caucus agrees with me or agrees with each other in terms of complicated issues like health care.","So it is important for me, then, to work every angle I can to get as much done as I can. If we had a parliamentary system, then this critique would make sense to me because you do as much as you can to negotiate with the other side, but at a certain point you've got your platform and you move it forward and your party votes for it.","But that's not the system of government we have. We've got a different system. I will say that the damage that the filibuster I think has done to the workings of our democracy are at this point pretty profound. The rate at which it's used just to delay and obstruct is unprecedented. But that's the reality right now.","So I guess my answer is that there has not been, I think, any issue that we've worked in which I have been willing to sign on to a compromise that I didn't feel was a strong improvement over the status quo and was not the best that we could do, given the political alignments that we've got.","And, yes, it leaves some folks dissatisfied. I understand that. But let's take the health care bill. As frustrated and angry and dispirited as the base might have been — we didn't have a public option, and it just dragged on for such a long time, and you're having conversations with Grassley, even though it turns out Grassley has no interest in actually getting something done — all the complaints which I was obviously very familiar with, the fact of the matter is, is that we got a piece of legislation through that we've been waiting a hundred years to get through; that in the aggregate sets up a system in which 30 million people are going to get health insurance; in which we've got an exchange that forces insurance companies to compete with a pool of millions and will be policed so that they can't jack up prices; that pool has purchasing power that they've never had before; that you've got a patient's bill of rights that was the hallmark, sort of the high-water mark of what progressives thought we could do in the health care field — we got that whole thing basically just as part of the bill.","You've got investments in community health centers and preventive medicine and research that's going to help improve our health care delivery systems as a whole. And we can build on that.","And I know this analogy has been used before, but when Social Security was passed, it was for widows and orphans. And a whole bunch of folks were not included in it. But that building block, the foundation stone, ended up creating one of the most important safety nets that we have. And I think the same thing is going to happen with health care.","I think when you look at financial regulatory reform, there's been a whole bunch of debates about where that could have gone and how it could have gone. And there are folks in the progressive community who complain we should have broken up the banks, or the derivatives law should have been structured this way rather than that way.","But the truth of the matter is, is that this is a incredibly powerful tool. You've got a Consumer Finance Protection Agency that that can save consumers billions of dollars — is already saving folks billions of dollars just by having it passed. Already you're starting to see negotiations in terms of how mortgage folks operate, in terms of how credit card companies operate.","You've got capital requirements that are being imposed on banks and other financial institutions that are much higher than they were before, which creates a cushion against the kind of too-big-to-fail that we've seen in the past.","You've got derivatives markets that are now being forced into open clearinghouses and markets so people know exactly what's going on. You've got Volcker rule that some people didn't think it was strong enough, but basically prohibits some of the proprietary trading that helped to create this market in securitized subprime loans that helped to trigger this disaster.","So in each of these cases, this glass isn't full, but it's got a lot of water in it. And so I guess my point is that on all these debates, my constant calculation has been, are we better off going ahead and getting this done? Or are we — is it better for us to have a fight that may end up being symbolically satisfying but means that we lose because we just don't have enough votes.","And I'll give you one last example because I know this is a famous example in the blogosphere, is the stimulus. I mean, if folks think that we could have gotten Ben Nelson, Arlen Specter and Susan Collins to vote for additional stimulus beyond the $700 billion that we got, then I would just suggest you weren't in the meetings.","This notion that somehow I could have gone and made the case around the country for a far bigger stimulus because of the magnitude of the crisis, well, we understood the magnitude of the crisis. We didn't actually, I think, do what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did, which was basically wait for six months until the thing had gotten so bad that it became an easier sell politically because we thought that was irresponsible. We had to act quickly.","And getting 60 votes for what was an unprecedented stimulus was really hard. And we didn't have the luxury of saying — first of all, we didn't have 60 votes at the time. We had 58. And we didn't have the luxury to say to the Senate, our way or the highway on this one.","So we did what we could in an emergency situation, anticipating that we were going to have to do more and hoping that we could continue to do more as time went on.","[INTERVIEWER]: So I have another gay question. [laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]: It's okay, man.","[INTERVIEWER]: And this one is on the issue of marriage. Since you've become [INTERVIEWED] , a lot has changed. More states have passed marriage equality laws. This summer a federal judge declared DOMA unconstitutional in two different cases. A judge in San Francisco declared Prop 8 was unconstitutional. And I know during the campaign you often said you thought marriage was the union between a man and a woman, and there — like I said, when you look at public opinion polling, it's heading in the right direction. We've actually got Republicans like Ted Olson and even Ken Mehlman on our side now. So I just really want to know what is your position on same-sex marriage?","[INTERVIEWED]: Joe, I do not intend to make big news sitting here with the five of you, as wonderful as you guys are. [laughter] But I'll say this —","[INTERVIEWER]: I just want to say, I would be remiss if I didn't ask you this question.","[INTERVIEWED]: Of course.","[INTERVIEWER]: People in our community are really desperate to know.","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it's a fair question to ask. I think that — I am a strong supporter of civil unions. As you say, I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage.","But I also think you're right that attitudes evolve, including mine. And I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents.","And I care about them deeply. And so while I'm not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in the Roosevelt Room at 3:30 in the afternoon, I think it's fair to say that it's something that I think a lot about. That's probably the best you'll do out of me today.","[INTERVIEWER]: It is an important issue, and I think that —","[INTERVIEWED]: I think it's an entirely fair question to ask.","[INTERVIEWER]: And part of it is that you can't be equal in this country if the very core of who you are as a person and the love — the person you love is not — if that relationship isn't the same as everybody else's, then we're not equal. And I think that a lot of — particularly in the wake of the California election on Prop 8, a lot of gay people realized we're not equal. And I think that that's — that's been part of the change in the —","[INTERVIEWED]: Prop 8, which I opposed.","[INTERVIEWER]: Right. I remember you did. You sent the letter and that was great. I think that the level of intensity in the LGBT community changed after we lost rights in that election. And I think that's a lot of where the community is right now.","[INTERVIEWED]: The one thing I will say today is I think it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going.","[INTERVIEWER]: The arc of history.","[INTERVIEWED]: The arc of history. Anything else?","[INTERVIEWER]: Well, can I ask you just about \"don't ask, don't tell,\" just following up? I just want to follow up. Because you mentioned it -","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes, sure. Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]: Is there a strategy for the lame-duck session to —","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: — and you're going to be involved?","[INTERVIEWED]: Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]: Will Secretary Gates be involved?","[INTERVIEWED]: I'm not going to tip my hand now. But there is a strategy.","[INTERVIEWER]: Okay.","[INTERVIEWED]: And, look, as I said —","[INTERVIEWER]: Can we call it a secret plan?","[INTERVIEWED]: I was very deliberate in working with the Pentagon so that I've got the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs being very clear about the need to end this policy. That is part of a strategy that I have been pursuing since I came into office. And my hope is that will culminate in getting this thing overturned before the end of the year.","Now, as usual, I need 60 votes. So I think that, Joe, the folks that you need to be having a really good conversation with — and I had that conversation with them directly yesterday, but you may have more influence than I do — is making sure that all those Log Cabin Republicans who helped to finance this lawsuit and who feel about this issue so passionately are working the handful of Republicans that we need to get this thing done.","[INTERVIEWER]: Yes, I don't have that relationship with them. [laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]: But, I mean, it's just — I don't understand the logic of it.","[INTERVIEWER]: Nor do I.","[INTERVIEWED]: You're financing a very successful, very effective legal strategy, and yet the only really thing you need to do is make sure that we get two to five Republican votes in the Senate.","And I said directly to the Log Cabin Republican who was here yesterday, I said, that can't be that hard. Get me those votes.","Because what I do anticipate is that John McCain and maybe some others will filibuster this issue, and we're going to have to have a cloture vote. If we can get through that cloture vote, this is done.","[INTERVIEWER]: On that same issue, because a lot of progressives — and you said you're not the king — well, a lot of progressives feel that senators, especially in the minority they think — we call them the House of Lords.","And are you in favor of any form of filibuster reform? Because there are several bills being talked about. And there is a unique time that — by the way, we're also very happy that Vice [INTERVIEWED] Biden went down to do a fundraiser for Alan Grayson. He's the type of Democrat that speaks out and fights. And that's what the progressive community really likes.","But he also might have the opportunity in January to be — to help out. And can we get — or are you for any of the bills that are out there to support — to change this rule that is paralyzing the administration?","[INTERVIEWED]: Well, I've got to be careful about not looking like I'm big-footing Congress. We've got separate branches of government. The House and the Senate have their own rules. And they are very protective of those prerogatives.","I will say that as just an observer of our political process that if we do not fix how the filibuster is used in the Senate, then it is going to be very difficult for us over the long term to compete in a very fast moving global environment.","What keeps me up at night is China, Germany, India, Brazil — they're moving. They make decisions, we're going to pursue clean energy, and the next thing you know they've cornered half the clean energy market; we're going to develop high-speed rail in the span of five years — suddenly they've got high-speed rail lines going; we're going to promote exports, here's what we're going to do — boom, they get going.","And if we can't sort of execute on key issues that will determine our competitiveness over the long term, we're going to fall behind — we are going to fall behind.","And the filibuster is not part of the Constitution. The filibuster, if you look at the history of it, may have arisen purely by accident because somebody didn't properly apply Robert's Rules of Procedure and forgot to get a provision in there about what was required to close debate. And folks figured out very early, this could be a powerful tool. It was used as a limited tool throughout its history. Sadly, the primary way it was used was to prevent African Americans from achieving civil rights.","But setting aside that sordid aspect of its history, it was used in a very limited fashion. The big debates, the big changes that we had historically around everything from establishing public schools to the moon launch to Social Security, they weren't subject to the filibuster. And I'm sympathetic to why the minority wants to keep it. And in fairness, Democrats, when we were in the minority, used it on occasion to blunt actions that we didn't think were appropriate by the Bush administration.","[INTERVIEWER]: On occasion.","[INTERVIEWED]: And in fairness, there were a whole bunch of folks here who were already writing blogs at the time who were saying, filibuster, block them, do anything you can to stop them. And so if we're going to call for reform, it's got to be with open eyes and an understanding that that also means that if Republicans are in power, it's easier for them to move their agendas forward.","But my general view is, what that does at least is it opens it up to serious public debate. Things don't get bogged down in the kinds of procedural nonsense that makes it just hard for us to do business. I mean, during the financial crisis, half my Treasury slots weren't filled — couldn't get them filled. And this is a time when we were worried that the entire financial system was melting down. So that's — I believe it's something that we've got to take seriously.","All right?","Pfeiffer: We need to get you to your next event, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]: Thank you, guys. I enjoyed it.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]: Appreciate it. We'll do it again.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thanks a lot.","[INTERVIEWED]: All right. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER]: How about the game tonight?","[INTERVIEWED]: Which one? Oh, the Series?","[INTERVIEWER]: The Series.","[INTERVIEWED]: You know, let me not wade into this one. [laughter] I think it's fun. But my White Sox aren't in it, so I just want a seven game. But I've got to say, Lee looks like a pretty tough pitcher. [applause]"]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithradioreporters","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, I want to thank all of you for coming today and for offering all of us this opportunity to have a conversation with the radio listeners around the country and beyond.","I thought I would open just by saying that I have sent a letter this afternoon to Senator Mitchell in the Senate about some potential amendments to the defense appropriation bill and one actual amendment dealing with Bosnia, Haiti, and the whole command and control apparatus of our military as it relates to cooperation with other countries in peacekeeping and other endeavors. That amendment has actually been introduced.","The letter essentially says that I oppose the amendment that affects the way our military people do their business, working with NATO and other military allies. I think it unduly gets into the details of the command and control operations of the military, which I think is an error, and that I would oppose any amendments with regard to Haiti and Bosnia that were of questionable constitutionality and unduly restricted the ability of the [INTERVIEWED] to make foreign policy, and outlines some of my concerns.","In Haiti, my concerns are that there should be no restrictions that would undermine the ability of the [INTERVIEWED] to protect the Americans on Haiti, that would aggravate the likelihood of another mass exodus of Haitians, or that would send a green light to the people who think they've got the best of both worlds: they got the sanctions lifted, and then they broke their word on the Governors Island Agreement.","With regard to Bosnia, the amendment simply points out that the United States has very strong NATO allies and that there were strict conditions that I have put on any kind of cooperation in Bosnia with NATO to enforce a peace agreement and that I think most Members of Congress agree with those conditions, but I don't think we should have an amendment which would tie the [INTERVIEWED]'s hands and make us unable to fulfill our NATO commitments, thus raising all kinds of questions about the longterm relationship of the United States to Europe.","So that's what the letter says. There is only one amendment so far that has been offered, and we are discussing with various Members of Congress other proposed amendments. We'll just have to see what happens. But I thought I ought to say clearly today that I would strenuously oppose such attempts to encroach on the [INTERVIEWED]'s foreign policy powers.","Now we can go to the questions. Mark [Mark Knoller, CBS News].","Haiti","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. Your opening statement raises the question of whether the United States would be willing to use military force for the purpose of removing the military leadership from Haiti and reinstalling [INTERVIEWED] Jean-Bertrand Aristide in power.","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me tell you what I have done today on Haiti, first of all. I just signed the Executive order freezing the assets of any people who are supporting the military and police leaders who have continued to fight the resumption of democracy and who are responsible for the bad things that have happened down there in the last few days. I have also, with the authorization of the Haitian government, directed our ships in the area to move closer to the shore so they will be in plain sight. And that has been done today.","I think we should continue to work with [INTERVIEWED] Aristide and with Prime Minister Malval. They want to go back to the sanctions. Remember, once the sanctions were tough, and they included oil, they produced the Governors Island Agreement. And what happened is that people who have an economic stranglehold on Haiti got what they wanted with Aristide's request, that is, lifting the sanctions. They got the amnesty that Aristide promised, they thought he would never give. And then, when time came for them to deliver what they agreed to do, they didn't do it.","So I think the appropriate position for us to take at this time is to go back to those sanctions and make them as tough as possible and enforce them as completely as possible. And that is what the Prime Minister wants us to do and what [INTERVIEWED] Aristide has asked us to do. I think it would be an error for me to discuss what further steps might or might not be taken. After all, we do have—I'll say again, we have 1,000 Americans there, and we have another 9,000 people with dual citizenship, and we'd have no way of knowing what will or won't happen.","But what the Haitians want is for the conditions of legitimacy to be maintained and restored. That is, the Haitian people have expressed their desires; two-thirds of them voted for [INTERVIEWED] Aristide. And in terms of the questions that have been raised again in recent days about whether he could or could not govern the country, that's why he worked so hard with our support to get Mr. Malval, who plainly can run the government, as one of the ablest people in the nation to be the Prime Minister so they'd have the kind of partnership that would work. So I feel comfortable that they are capable of working with their friends and allies in the area to bring about a more democratic and a more prosperous Haiti if given the chance.","Health Care Reform","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], economists are expressing some concern of late about your health care reform plan and about whether it might grow considerably larger than you envision. What assurances can you give the American public that it either will not grow out of control or that the need for universal health care is worth it ballooning to the size of, say, Medicare and Medicaid, which are 10 times larger than originally predicted?","[INTERVIEWED]. First of all, let me say that it's not a Government program. The Government will only insure the unemployed uninsured. Two-thirds of the funding for this program will come from employers and the employees who don't presently contribute anything to the American health care system.","Secondly, where have these economists been for the last 15 years? I mean, the American health care system is already 40 percent more expensive than any other one in the world and the only advanced health care system in the world that can't seem to figure out how to provide coverage to everybody while spending 40 percent more than anybody else spends.","The budget we just passed in this Government has Medicare and Medicaid going up at 3 times the rate of inflation. We proposed to reduce that in our bill. We have also ceilings on how much health care expenditures can increase in any given year if the competition doesn't cut the costs.","Now, if you look around the country at the places which have tried serious efforts at managed competition, including bringing the Medicaid program into a competitive arena, there's every indication that the rate of increase will slow down and that it will work. But the economists, they seem to want it all ways. They criticize me on the one hand for having a ceiling on how much costs could increase in any given year and then saying we don't have any guarantees, if you take it off they won't increase more. And it is difficult to imagine how we could design a system that would have costs more out of control than the one we have. I mean, the reason we have so much support here from employers in heavy industry, for example, who already cover their employees is that they're being killed by the cost increases.","The system we have is irresponsible and out of control financially, and doesn't provide health care security to Americans. So we think there are plenty of protections built in to slow the rate of increase in costs. In fact, if anything, I think we've been certainly realistic and then some, in estimating how fast we can slow costs down. That is, even under our plan, it is estimated that the percent of our income going to health care will go from about 14.5 to about 18 by the end of the decade, and that if we just stay with the system we've got, which is the alternative—in all these things, you've got to ask what's the alternative—we'll go from 14.5 to 19 to 20 by the end of the decade. We have allowed and budgeted for significant increased expenses in health care.","Republican Criticism","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in the past week or so you and your foreign policy team have come in for some pretty blistering criticism, especially from a group of prominent Republicans. Richard Lugar, Dick Cheney, Dan Quayle, James Baker, and Robert Dole have all been very, very critical of your foreign policy. And some members of your administration have suggested that's politically motivated, these people might be running for [INTERVIEWED]. What do you make of it, and how do you react to those criticisms?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think you can monitor their travel schedules and statements as well as I can. I don't have anything to say about that. I'm going to do my job as best I can. I'm going to try to support a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. I'm going to try to involve Republicans and Democrats in the process of consultation and getting as good advice as I can all the way along. And I think that you have to expect that when things go very well, as they did with Russia and the Middle East, people will say you're doing fine, and if difficulties arise, then some will say that you didn't do fine. So I just don't want to get into the politics of it.","If you want to talk about any specific policy in any specific country, I'll do my best to answer that. But I think it serves no useful purpose for me to engage any of them in this sort of debate. Whatever the political motivations are, I have a contract that runs for a specific amount of time. I'm going to do the very best I can during that time, and then when the time is up the American people can make their own judgments. I haven't even been [INTERVIEWED] a year. I don't have any interest in starting a political debate now.","Administration Goals","[INTERVIEWER]. Even though it's been less than a year, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it's been a very ambitious Presidency with a lot of projects you've taken on yourself, health care reform, reinventing Government, national service, things you inherited like Somalia, Haiti in a way, NAFTA. Is there ever coming a point, is there now a point that you just have to say, enough is enough for now, the plate is too full, we have to resolve some of these things before we get on with other things?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. And we have taken that position. I mean, first of all, if you go back to the budget, we kept the budget front and center until that was resolved. And it plainly has worked rather well. Long-term interest rates are still below 6 percent. The budget did some remarkable things. It dramatically broadened the availability of college loans to students, and it has the most significant piece of tax reform for working families in 20 years by increasing the earned-income tax credit, so that all working families on modest incomes with children will know they'll be lifted above the Federal poverty lines. That's a lot to accomplish in a year right there.","The national service bill passed, and very well, and of course, a number of other pieces of legislation have. And now, what we're going to focus on between now and the end of the year is making as much headway as we can on the first round of reinventing Government cuts, on the crime bill, on the political reform initiatives that some of which have passed the Senate already, the campaign finance reform and lobby reform bill, and on getting the health care bill heard and setting schedules there so we'll know that it will be reviewed along with all other ideas in a prompt and timely fashion, and we'll be able to see as we wind up here a process which unfolds next year and brings us to a datecertain vote.","But we do have a lot going. We probably had more done this year than in any given first year in a long time, and there's still a lot more to do. For example, we started our welfare reform task force hearings around the country, but I don't intend to offer any legislation on that until next year. And there will be a lot of other things that will come up as we go along next year. We want, for example, to change the whole unemployment system, as you know, to a reemployment system. We don't think that will be offered until next year, to give the American people a system of lifetime education and training.","I do hope that we can pass as many bills as possible this year. I was heartened by the fact that the House passed our education reform bill, the Goals 2000 bill, with such a big bipartisan majority last week, which made me think we could probably pass that bill completely before the Congress goes home the end of the year.","Russia","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it's coming up on 2 years since the end of the Soviet Union and the declaration by the remaining states to call themselves democracies or create democracies. Secretary Christopher is headed over there. Can you tell us what the objective of his trip is? Will he be looking to set up a summit meeting?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, there is a possibility, of course, that [INTERVIEWED] Yeltsin and I will meet again early next year; I have to go to Europe to the NATO summit. But primarily, what he wants to do is to convey the continuing support of the United States for democracy and reform in Russia, to urge the Yeltsin administration on in their efforts to complete the timetable to get a new constitution and to have legislative elections and to restore completely the conditions of democracy in Russia, and to review the progress on the Russian aid package, both the ones, the two passed by the United States Congress here with strong bipartisan support and the international package that came out of the G-7 summit. And so he'll be doing all those things. And I'm sure they'll review some of the difficulties in that part of the world, too. [INTERVIEWED] Yeltsin also has his share of foreign policy problems that he can't fully solve. But we'll talk about that. We're interested very much in some of those things. Especially we'd like to see the last Russian troops withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia, as they have been from Lithuania.","Haiti","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], if we could return to the Haiti issue for just a moment. Senator Dole said he didn't think it was worth any American lives to restore [INTERVIEWED] Aristide. You indicated you didn't want to go too far into options. But are there conditions beyond, say, a direct physical threat to the U.S. Embassy compound in Port-au-Prince under which you would consider committing U.S. troops to Haiti? For example, attacks or killings of foreigners, a flow of refugees, or maybe just threats against foreigners? Are there any conditions for sending U.S. troops?","[INTERVIEWED]. I just think at this time it's better for me not to rule in or out options. Keep in mind, the Haitian Government, as we speak, has not asked for that and does not want that. And keep in mind that the sanctions did work once before to get this agreement, which was not honored perhaps because we raised the sanctions, we lifted the sanctions.","But let me remind you that the circumstances of this need to be focused on. Haiti is very much in our backyard. The people wanted democracy. There is the continuing issue of whether there would be another exodus of Haitians trying to come to the United States, something which I think is not in their interest or ours but is something that the present conditions could make more likely. And we do have those Americans there.","So what I want to do today is to encourage Prime Minister Malval and the brave people who are in his government and the good people of Haiti who plainly want democracy and are being pushed around by the only guys in town with guns, which I regret very much. But we are trying to preserve the legitimacy of democracy there.","Now, the truth is, as you know, there are people in this country, in the press, and in the Congress and elsewhere, who, notwithstanding the vote of the Haitian people, basically have never felt very strongly about returning Aristide anyway and have questioned his fitness to be [INTERVIEWED]. You can do that with the winner of any election. But all I can tell you is that I would just like to observe just a couple of things. Number one is, unlike his adversaries, [INTERVIEWED] Aristide has done everything he said he would do under the Governors Island Agreement, including giving them amnesty. And secondly, recognizing his lack of experience in politics and business, he reached out to a man like Malval, who's plainly one of the ablest people in the country and clearly a very stable and reassuring figure, asking him to run the government. So I feel that we should support the democratic movement in Haiti. And I think that the steps we're taking now are the appropriate ones.","Assistant Attorney General Nominee","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], have you decided on a nominee for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't want to give you an evasive answer, but let me tell you what happened. We had, weeks ago, a nominee who declined the position for personal reasons. And the Justice Department was asked, the Attorney General specifically was asked, to make another recommendation. I believe that she has a recommendation for me which I have not yet formally received. But I am not positive of that, but I believe so.","Gun Control Legislation","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I'd like to ask you about a subject that you've brought up in a number of your remarks lately. You've been discussing the issue of gun control, firearms violence, the extremely high cost of health care related to firearm injuries. Senator Chafee of Rhode Island has once again introduced legislation which is pending in the Judiciary Committee now which would ban the sale, manufacture, possession, importation, or exportation of all handguns with exceptions for law enforcement, military, and licensed target clubs. You've talked about your support for the Brady bill and for a ban on assault weapons. How would you feel about Senator Chafee's bill, which I understand Dr. Sullivan, former HHS Secretary, is testifying on tomorrow?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I have to read it, but I think it might go a little far if it bans all handguns, just because I think that there is a lot of evidence that Americans have used handguns responsibly for sporting purposes, that they're not all used as weapons for committing crimes or killing people. I do believe, however— and let me say first—secondly, as a practical matter, I have not yet been able to get Congress to vote on the crime bill, including the Brady bill and the vote to ban a comprehensive list of assault weapons.","I also know that I heard that Senator Kohl has an amendment, which I would encourage, which would make national the ban on ownership or possession of handguns by minors unless with their parents or another supervising adult in an appropriate setting, which might be the way to go on the issue that Senator Chafee is concerned about. Nonetheless, I hold him in the highest regard. He's, I think, an extremely responsible person, and I welcome the hearings on his legislation. But I would have a little problem with a total ban on handguns. I would have a problem with that based on what my understanding of the situation is.","Again, we ought to focus on the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, and banning possession by minors right now. Since I have been working on this in the last several months, one of the multitude of statistics that's made the biggest impression on me is the one that we were told a couple of weeks ago, that now someone shot in a criminal encounter is 3 times more likely to die from a gunshot wound because they're likely to have nearly three bullets in them, as opposed to only 15 years ago. That is a huge statistical change. And of course, as I pointed out, these wounds and the homicides put an enormous financial burden on this country, on the medical system, on the criminal justice system.","But mostly, it's an incredible human problem. We've got 90,000 people in the last 4 years murdered in America, most of them by gunshots. That's more in any single year than were ever lost in a single year in the war in Vietnam. I think the time has come to do something about this. And I'm hopeful that both Houses of Congress will act on the crime bill and on the assault weapons bill before the end of the year. I hate to keep coming back to this, but right now I don't know that we have the votes to pass the assault weapons ban in the Congress. And I hope we can get the votes to do that and to pass the limitation on minors and possession or ownership of handguns. I think if we push those now in the Brady bill, then the Congress could really make a dent on the exposure of Americans to lethal violence.","War Powers Resolution","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], could I go back to your comments about the use of American military force and your discussions with Congress? Would you oppose, would you veto legislation which contained an amendment requiring you to ask and get the consent of Congress before you use troops in Haiti or Bosnia? And how far do you think the congressional role in the war powers area goes?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me say, my letter says that I want to resist and that I urge the Senate not to vote for things which unduly infringe on the [INTERVIEWED]'s power, and certainly not things that are of questionable constitutionality. Before I express an opinion about a veto, I need to see a specific piece of legislation. And there are still discussions going on about the questions of Haiti and Bosnia. The whole issue of the War Powers Resolution and the role of Congress and the role of the [INTERVIEWED] obviously has been the subject of virtually nonstop debate in America for the last several years, for all kinds of obvious reasons. Sometimes Congress has acted or attempted to act to restrict the [INTERVIEWED]'s authority under [INTERVIEWED]s Reagan and Bush, and sometimes they have.","All I can tell you is that I think I have a big responsibility to try to appropriately consult with Members of Congress in both parties— whenever we are in the process of making a decision which might lead to the use of force. I believe that. But I think that, clearly, the Constitution leaves the [INTERVIEWED], for good and sufficient reasons, the ultimate decisionmaking authority. And I think to cut off that authority in advance of it being made without all the circumstances and facts there before us is an error and could really lead to weakening our relationships with a lot of our allies and encouraging the very kind of conduct we want to discourage in the world.","I understand what's going on here, and it's all perfectly predictable, given any reading of American history and perfectly understandable, given the aversion that Americans have always had to seeing any of our young people die when the existence of our country was not immediately at stake. And the [INTERVIEWED] should be very circumspect and very careful in committing the welfare and the lives of even our All-Volunteer Army. We need to have a clear American interest there, and there needs to be clearlydefined conditions of involvement, and the burden is on the [INTERVIEWED] to provide those. But still the [INTERVIEWED] must make the ultimate decision, and I think it's a mistake to cut those decisions off in advance.","Advice From Previous Administrations","[INTERVIEWER]. Final question. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. In the past week or so, [INTERVIEWED] Bush himself and, as we've already discussed here today, some members of his foreign policy team have criticized your foreign policy team. I'm curious about the promise that has been reported that [INTERVIEWED] Bush made to you. And it's also been reported in at least one commentary, that there was an implied promise from your side to go easy on any revelations about the so-called Iraqgate scandal. What can you tell us about your discussions with Mr. Bush on this?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, with regard to the Iraqgate issue, there was no promise expressed or implied. There was no discussion about that between me and [INTERVIEWED] Bush. I believe he said publicly that he would not have anything negative to say about the administration for a year at least, that he thought we were entitled to that.","And again, I just don't want to get into this. This is a free country, people have free speech, they can say whatever they want to say. I think you will agree. And maybe I've been wrong to do it, but I have been pretty careful about focusing on the problems we have in the future and not trying to spend a lot of time establishing partisan blame for the past. I said that in my State of the Union speech. I said it in the health care speech. I said it repeatedly. What's past is past. I'm doing the best I can with the issues that I faced when I came here. If the time comes in the future when I have to engage in a debate with any of those folks about whodid-what-when, I'll do my best to have that kind of a debate. But I just don't think—it doesn't get us very far. And I would hope that if they have a constructive suggestion to make about what America should do, I would be more than happy to take it. I'm not ashamed to ask for advice from anybody, Republicans or Democrats. I've called every living former [INTERVIEWED], I've called former Secretaries of State, I've called those that agreed and disagreed. As you know, Secretary Shultz thought that the previous administration should have done more in Bosnia, thought that we should. I mean, there are people who have—Secretary Kissinger thought just the reverse. I mean, this is a new and difficult and uncertain time. But if they have anything to say about what they think we ought to do, I'll be glad to listen, and I'd just ask that it be constructive when they do it.","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm told by your aides that we're out of time. On behalf of the radio networks, we thank you, and we hope we can make this a regular thing.","[INTERVIEWED]. I would like to do it on a regular basis. I'm a big radio listener, you know. Except if we did it enough, we could even have Top 10 countdowns in the middle and stuff. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. We accept the challenge.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithradiotalkshowhosts","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you very much, and welcome to the Executive Office Building and to the White House, and thank you for coming today. Iwhat did you say, nice tie? That's a Save the Children tie.","Audience member. All right!","[INTERVIEWED]. I wore it for the national service signing today.","It's interesting, we just had a lunch with a number of columnists","Audience members. Lunch? Lunch?","[INTERVIEWED]. Lunch? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Would it make you feel better if I said I didn't enjoy it? I mean anyway, and they knew you were all here, and we had 700 or 800 people out on the lawn for the national service signing. And four or five of these folks that have been covering Washington for 20 years said they had never seen the White House so busy. I didn't know if they were happy or sad about it, but anyway, it's busy.","I thank you for coming today. I hope this will be the first of a number of opportunities we have to provide people who have radio talk shows and who communicate with millions of Americans on an intimate basis, daily, to come to the White House to have these kinds of briefings. You've already heard all the basic approaches that the administration is going to take on health care and that will be hopefully crystallized in a compelling way in my address to the Congress and to the country tomorrow evening.","So, I thought what I would do is make a general statement about how this fits into the overall approach the administration is taking and then answer your questions. I'd rather spend time just answering your questions.","But let me just make a general comment, that I think you canthat runs through the thread of debate that we had on the economic program, on the health care issue, on NAFTA, on the crime bill that's coming up, on the welfare reform issue, on all the major things we're trying to come to grips with.","It is now commonplace to say that we are living through a time of profound change, not only in our country but around the world. People are trying to come to grips with a rate and nature of change that comes along less frequently than once a generation.","You may know that just since you've been sitting here, Boris Yeltsin has dissolved the Russian Parliament and called elections for that Parliament in December, and his major opponent has apparently declared himself [INTERVIEWED]. I mean, they are going through these things, trying to come to grips with what it means to be a democracy and what it means to try to change the economy.","In our country, if we're going to continue to be the leading power of the world, not just militarily but economically, socially, the shining light of the world, this has to be a good place for most Americans to live. Most people have to know that if they work hard and play by the rules that they can make the changes that are sweeping through this country and the world their friends and not their enemies. They have to believe that as citizens they can work together and trust the major institutions of our society to function well, to meet these changes, to respond to them.","We confront this bewildering array of challenges: the size of the deficit, the fact that we have an investment deficit, too, in many critical areas, the health care crisis, at a time when most people are quite insecure in their own lives and most Americans have worked harder for stagnant or lower wages for the last 10 to 20 years, when they're paying more for the basics in life, when they have lost faith in the fundamental capacity of political institutions to represent them and to solve problems.","I think you can see that in the 700,000 letters we got on health care. The number of people who would say, you know, \"What's wrong with me? I worked hard all my life, and I lost my health insurance,\" or \"My child got sick, and now I can never change my job,\" or \"My wife and I spend 60 hours a week running our business. And our health insurance was $200 a month 4 years ago, and it's over $900 a month today,\" you know that things are out of control. I say that because I believe providing security in the health care area and in meeting the other objectives we talked about, quality and choice and cost controls and all, is a necessary precondition, not only to improve the health care of the American people but to help root the American people again in this moment, to make them freer to face the other challenges that we face. I see in this debate over NAFTA which I have wrestled with in my own mind, that is, the whole nature of our trade relations with Mexico and other countries and where we are going for far longer than I've been [INTERVIEWED], I had to deal with it when I was a Governor. I see people, some of them looking ahead with confidence in the future that we can triumph in the world of the 21st century, that we can compete and win, that we can create tomorrow's jobs, and others so uncertain about it, just trying to hold on to today and to yesterday's jobs.","So, what I am trying to do is to give the American people a greater sense of security over those things that are basic to their lives that they can control and at the same time challenge our people to assume responsibility for dealing with our problems and for marching confidently into the future. That's what this national service issue is all about that we celebrated today on the White House lawn.","And therefore, the health care issue is about more than health care. It is about restoring selfconfidence to America's families and businesses. It's about restoring some discipline to our budget and investment decisions, not only in the Government but in the private sector. It's about giving us the sense that we actually can move forward and win in the face of all these changes. I cannot underor I guess I cannot overstate how important I think it is, not only on its own terms but also for what it might mean for America over the long run.","Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Does anybody really know whether this will work, from the administration? Have you parsed the numbers that fine, that you can say if this is passed in toto, it will indeed do what you say, cut costs, maintain quality of care, cover everybody?","[INTERVIEWED]. We know it will do that, but that's not exactly what you asked. That is, we know that if this plan is adopted, it will provide universal coverage, that it will achieve substantial savings in many areas where there is massive waste.","Dr. Koop, who was, you know, [INTERVIEWED] Reagan's Surgeon General, who was with us yesterday, and the doctors that we had, said that in his judgment, there was at least $200 billion of waste, unnecessary procedures, administrative waste, fraudulent churning of the system, at least, in our system. So, we know that those things will achieve those objectives? We do. Do we know that every last dollar is accurate, or that there will be no unintended consequences, or that the timetable is precisely right? No we don't know that because nobody can know that exactly.","But I would like to make two points. Number one, our administration has gone further to get good health care numbers than anyone ever has before. Until I became [INTERVIEWED] I didn't know this, but the various Agencies in the Federal Government responsible for various parts of health care financing and regulation had never had their experts sit down in the same room together and agree on the same set of numbers and the same methodologies for achieving them. So that's the first thing we did. No wonder we had so much fight over what something was going to cost and the deficit was going crazy. The Government had never gotten its own act together.","Then the second thing we did was to go out and solicit outside actuaries from private sector firms who made a living evaluating the cost of health care and asked them to review our numbers. Now, that is very important that you understand that, because there is going to be there should be a debate over whether the course I have recommended is the best course to achieve the goals we all want to achieve, whether there is a better course, whether we can achieve the Medicare and Medicaid cuts that we say we can achieve without hurting the quality of care. That's fine. But I want you to understand that we really have killed ourselves at least to get the arithmetic right, to give people an honest starting point, a common ground to start from, so that we can have the arguments over policy.","Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you feel that your plan places undue hardship on business with the employer mandate versus an individual plan that has been proposed with other proposals?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, and I'll say why. First of all, let's just look at the employer mandate. Most employers cover their employees. I like your question in the sense that the question assumes that we should have universal coverage, and that's a good assumption. If you don't have universal coverage, you can never really slow the rate of waste in cost, because you'll always have a lot of cost shifting in the system. That is, people who aren't covered will still get health care, but they'll get it when it's too late, too expensive, somebody else will pay the bill, and it will have real inefficiencies and distortions, as it does today.","If you want to cover everybody, there are essentially three ways to do it. You can do it the way Canada does. You can abolish all private health insurance premiums, raise taxes to replace the health insurance premiums, and have a single-payer system, just have the Government do it. That's the most administratively efficient. That is, the Canadian system has very low administrative costs, even lower than Germany and Japan. The problem is, it's not very good for controlling costs in other ways, because the Government makes all the cost decisions. The citizens know they've already paid for this through government. So they make real demands on the system. Whereas if you have a mixed system where employers and employees are actually in there knowing what they're spending on health care and lobbying for better management and to control costs, like in Germany, you don't have costs go up as fast. So the Canadian system, even though it's administratively the cheapest, is the second most expensive in the world. We're spending 14 percent of our income; they're spending 10 percent of theirs. Everybody else is under 9.","Now, the second system is the individual mandate. It's never been tried anywhere. The problem with the individual mandate is that it couldand again, I want a debate on this. I think the Republicans are entitled to their day in court on this, and I want them to have it. Really, I do. I mean, I want an honest, open discussion on this. I am so impressed with the spirit that is pervading this health insurance we had 400 Members of Congress show up for 2 days at our health care university just trying to get everybody to have enough information to be singing out of the same hymnal when we talk to one another.","The dangers of the individual mandates are that it could cause the present system we have for most Americans, which is working well for most Americans, to disintegrate. That is, you have to have some subsidies with an individual mandate. So will companies that now cover their employees basically start covering their upper income employees or not their lower income employees? Will they dump all their employees and make them go under the individual mandate system? How are you going to keep up with all these individuals when you realize who you've got to subsidize or not? In other words, we believe it has significantly more administrative burdens, and it has the potential to cause the present system to come undone. But they deserve their day in court on it, and we'll debate it.","Let me just say this. Our system for small businesses, I'd like to make the following points: We propose to keep lower the premiums of small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, including all those that are just starting up. And they get more if their wages of their employees are low, and low-wage workers also get a subsidy to try to make sure nobody goes out of business. But the point I want to make is, most small businesses who do cover their employees, and that's the majority of them, are paying too much for their health insurance. They are being burdened by it. That's one reason 100,000 Americans a month permanently lose their health insurance, as well as at any given time in a year, as many as one in four may be without it.","So what we propose to do will actually help more small businesses than it will hurt. And over the long run, they'll all be better off, because if you put everybody under this system, then the rate of increase in health care costs will be much lower. And it's just not fair, at some point, for anybody who can pay something to get a free ride, because keep in mind, we all get health care in this country. But if we're not insured, we get it when it's too late, too expensive. Usually we show up at the emergency room, the most expensive of all, and then somebody else pays the bill. That's one of the things that's driving these costs out of sight.","Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWER]. We've heard a lot about every group today, except for the doctors. And from the doctors that I'm hearing from, they're saying that this is going to hit them in their pockets. In my experience before in being in operating rooms and seeing doctors after the diagnostic related groups started setting some prices of procedures back in the eighties, a lot of doctors that went into business for themselves were either multiusing single-use items or resterilizing items that were made for single-use so that they wouldn't lose any of the money that was going to be coming to them, so they wouldn't take a personal hit out of it. How does your plan guarantee us an uncompromised medical plan?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, for one thing, the quality standards that govern medical care today will still be in effect. That is, most of them are professional standards, and they're not enforced by the Government today.","[INTERVIEWER]. They're talking about doing more procedures to make up the money. They're saying, \"Well, I'm going to have to see more patients and spend less time with them.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but that's what's happening today. I mean, the truth is that as we've tried to control the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, particularly Medicare, by holding down costs, you see dramatically increased numbers of procedures. What we want to do is to remove the incentive for having large numbers of procedures by having big blocks of consumers pay for their annual health care needs in a block, so that you won't have so much fee-for-service.","I would also point out to you that one of the big problems we've had with doctor costs going up is that doctors are having to negotiate their way through the mine field of 1,500 separate health insurance companies writing thousands of different policies, having to keep up with it in ways that no doctors anywhere in the world but our doctors have to deal with.","We've already had the American Academy of Family Practice and a lot of other doctors groups have endorsed our plan. The AMA has been quite interestingly supportive in general terms. They say they want to see all the details. They believe there ought to be universal coverage. Dr. Koop has agreed to come in and sort of moderate this discussion. But we had a couple hundred doctors here yesterday, most of whom were extremely supportive. And let me just give you one big reason why. This is the flip side of the argument you made.","In 1980, the average doctor was taking home 75 percent of the money generated by a clinic. In 1990, the average doctor was taking home 52 cents on the dollar, 52 percent of the money generated by a clinic. Twenty-three cents on the dollar increase in the amount of money the doctor was having to spend on people, basically to do clerical work in the clinics.","The Children's Hospital at Washington told us last week that the 200 doctors on staff there spent enough time in non-health-care-related paperwork every year because of the administrative cost of this systema dime on the dollar more than any other system in the worldto see another 500 patients each a year, 10,000 more kids a year. So, a lot of doctors are going to feel very liberated by this because they are going to be freer to practice medicine, and the incentives to churn the system just to pay for all their paperwork will be less.","Yes, sir.","Mr. Strauss. Time for one more question.","[INTERVIEWER]. I guess I have the opportunity, I'll make it a two-part question because it's a rare opportunity, and I appreciate it. First of all, if you receive everything that you want, that you're hoping for, and we hear about the 37 million uninsured and the many underinsured people, I'm wondering if there's anybody that will be disappointed with the new system","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh yeah.","[INTERVIEWER]. if you get everything you want, and who those people might be? And secondly, I hear very little about medical fraud and medical malpractice problems, as if it isn't a major problem, and we are led to believe that it is.","[INTERVIEWED]. It is a big problem. Maybe I should answer that question first, because it's a quicker one. Then let me try to tell you how to sort through the winners and losers. Okay?","First of all, in this system if you put consumers of health care, employers and employees, particularly the small businesses, in large buying groups where they will have more market power and more oversight authority, you will inevitablywe are going to change the economic incentives as well as the private sector oversight to reduce fraud and abusewe are definitely going to see big savings there.","Secondly, what was the other thing you asked me?","[INTERVIEWER]. The medical malpractice.","[INTERVIEWED]. Medical malpractice. Doctors","[INTERVIEWER]. Doctors spending[inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, doctors","[INTERVIEWER]. [Inaudible]","[INTERVIEWED]. One of the things that we don't know is how much extra excess procedures and tests are done as defensive medicine or to churn the system, to go back to your other question. The economic incentives to churn the system will be dramatically reduced under these kind of payment plans.","It will be more like the way the Rochester, New York, system works, the way the Mayo Clinic system works. More and more people will be in a system where they pay up front, and then they take what they need. And the doctors are going to get paid out of that.","But the malpractice issue is a problem. We will propose some significant reforms, including limiting the percentage of income lawyers can get in contingency fees in lawsuits. But I have to tell you, what I think the most significant and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms but I think the most important one will be permitting the professional associations to draw up medical practice guidelines which, when approved, will protect the doctors to some extent, because if they follow the guidelines in any given case, it will raise a presumption that they weren't negligent. And that will be a real protection against just doing an extra procedure because you're trying to hedge against a lawsuit.","The State of Maine pioneered this because they wanted more general practitioners in rural Maine to do more things for people like help deliver babies because they didn't have anybody else to do it. So, the idea of giving people practice guidelines I think is very good.","Now, you asked who's going to win and who's going to lose. Can we talk through that?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll tell you who will have to pay more. You know, there will be some people who will have to pay more. The news magazines this week did a pretty good job of analyzing this.","If we go to community rating, so that we can allow people, for example, who have had a sick child not to be bankrupt by their insurance costs and to move from job to job, and you put everybody in a broad community, it means young, single, super healthy people will pay more in the first year of this than they would have otherwise. Now, here's why I think that's a good deal for young, single, super healthy people. Number one, all young, single, super healthy people will get insured, and they aren't now. Number two, they'll all be middleaged someday, too, and they'll win big. Number three, their cost will go up less every year. So even though they might pay more this year, within 5 to 8 years, if this plan goes through, everybody will be paying less than they would have. So, they would pay more.","Secondly, there are some businesses who don't insure at all. They'll have to pay something. There are others who insure but only for catastrophic. They will have to pay more, but they'll get much better benefits, and their rates will go up less. So, there will be some people who will pay more now than they were paying. But I believe that if we cankeep in mind, if we can stop the cost of health care from going up at 2 and 3 times the rate of inflation, if we can get it down where the rate of increase is much lower, by the end of the decade everybody will be way better off than they were.","Russia","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] do you approve ofBoris Yeltsin's announcement that he's going to dissolve the Parliament, and does the United States support him in his power struggle with his opponents?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, let me say I have had only a sketchy briefing about this, and I have not talked to [INTERVIEWED] Yeltsin yet. I would like to reserve the right to issue a statement after I attempt to talk to [INTERVIEWED] Yeltsin. In any case, I will issue a statement before the end of the day, but I think at least I should have a direct briefing.","Yes sir, one more. Go ahead.","Health Care Reform","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED] Clinton, tomorrow you'll be speaking before a joint session of Congress and there are 535 people, individuals, in Congress that will have their own specific plans of what they want","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. If you could say that you could put your name on one or two or three specific parts of this that you want to say, \"This is my health care plan,\" that you want to see no matter what 535 other people want to see, that you feel you want to be part of your Clinton health care program, what two or three items, specifically?","[INTERVIEWED]. Number one, every American would have security in their health care system. You would be able to get health insurance, there would be adequate benefits, and you wouldn't lose them. Number two, the system would impose a far higher level of responsibility for managing costs than it does now on all the players, including the consumers. Number three, people would keep their choice of physicians and medical providers. And number four, we would guarantee adequate access to preventive and primary care so we could stop some of the big things that are happening to us before they get going. And five, we would have market incentives to bring costs down. Those are the things that I want to be the hallmark of our program.","I wish I could stay all day. I'm sorry, but thank you very much."," "]}

Italy and Europe are grateful to the United States for the liberation from fascism and the nazism. But today, Europe and America are still divided about Ira[INTERVIEWER]. When you go in Europe, there will certainly be some demonstration against you. What is the responsibility of this situation?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes, look, first of all, we share the same values we being America and Europe. And one of the values we share is the freedom for people to express themselves. So I have no problem with people saying, \"I disagree.\" Matter of fact, I think it's a healthy sign, and I think it's positive.","Secondly, there are there is common agreement that Iraq must be free and peaceful. We had disagreements about the decision to enforce the U.N. Security Council resolution, but there's common agreement in Europe with America that it's in the world's interest that Iraq be free and peaceful. Today I just talked to the new Prime Minister and had a very good conversation with him. And he said, \"Thank you for giving us a chance, and thank you for standing with us.\" And when he said thank you, he wasn't talking just to me. He was talking to the Italian people and the American people and the Brits and all the people in our coalition that are now helping in Ira[INTERVIEWER].","So I'm very upbeat and very as I head over to honor what happened 60 years ago, I think we're now seeing unity to work toward common good today. And I'm looking forward to it.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, but some Europeans blame you for having kept them out of the decision to go to the war in Ira[INTERVIEWER].","[INTERVIEWED] Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think this is the real reason for present difficulties?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, first of all, I don't see many difficulties. You mean in Iraq?","[INTERVIEWER]. In Ira[INTERVIEWER].","[INTERVIEWED] Oh, in Ira[INTERVIEWER].","[INTERVIEWER]. And at the U.N. as well.","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I think you'll see","[INTERVIEWER]. The ground and the","[INTERVIEWED] Yes. No, I think you'll see in the U.N. there's going to be common agreement. I think we'll get a new Security Council resolution. Remember, 1441 at the Security Council, we voted unanimously to say to Saddam Hussein, \"Disarm, or face serious consequences.\" Then it became clear he didn't disarm and didn't disclose, and so we had a debate about the definition of serious consequences.","My attitude is, when you say something, you better do it. In other words, the world said, \"Serious consequences, Mr. Hussein.\" And had there not been serious consequences, I think he would have been extremely dangerous, and the United Nations would have been viewed as very weak.","And so, the United States, along with a lot of other nations, agreed that we must enforce serious consequences. But everybody had a chance to participate. Everybody had a chance, particularly on the Security Council, to say yes or no. But that is now behind us, and that's what is important for the people of your great country to understand. There is a better day ahead.","Now, in terms of Iraq, it's tough. And the reason it's tough is because there are killers in that country who want to stop the march to freedom. The worst thing they fear is free elections, but they're not going to stop us. That's what you've got to understand. We are not going to be intimidated by killers in Iraq or anywhere else, for that matter.","[INTERVIEWER]. Some have said that you never admit to any shortcomings, much less failures. Looking back at the past year, do you have anything to reproach yourself regarding what has gone wrong? Did you make any mistakes?","[INTERVIEWED] Listen, any time you go to war, circumstances change. And the fundamental question is, were we flexible enough to change with the circumstances? And we have been. Could we this is all hypothetical, when you think about it. We are changing a country from tyranny to freedom, a country where people were brutalized, tortured, raped, killed, maimed, to a country which is going to govern itself. And it has been hard work.","A lot of things didn't happen that we thought might happen, the oil production, for example. We thought that would be blown up, and it would cost the Iraqi citizens a lot of money. It wasn't. We thought that people would go hungry or there would be mass refugees, neither of which happened.","What did happen is, is that we moved too quickly. Our troops stormed through to Baghdad, and then it caused it enabled some of the Saddam loyalists, some of them, to disperse. In other words, they didn't stay and fight. They ran off. They regrouped and came back to fight. And I  and our troops were given the flexibility on the ground to deal with that. Now, I wish the Iraqi people had overwhelmingly said, \"Thank you for coming.\" I think they will. But some didn't. Some said, \"Let's fight them.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. But don't you think that now this new government could been seen as a puppet government because there are a lot of elements close to America America gives them money?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, we look, you're talking about the current Prime Minister.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED] And you bet we supported a group that he headed. We didn't support him. We supported his group. You know why? Because he wanted to get rid of Sad-dam Hussein, and the reason why he did is not because of America. He wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein killed and tortured his fellow citizens. You remember what Saddam Hussein is like. He was a tyrant. He was brutal. He had torture rooms. There was mass graves we discovered. I had the other day in the Oval Office seven men whose hands had been cut off by Saddam Hussein.","[INTERVIEWER]. We have shown this picture.","[INTERVIEWED] Have you? Good.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, we have.","[INTERVIEWED] A very touching moment.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you happy with this new government in Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED] I am happy that Mr. Brahimi did what he said he would do. The government was picked by the United Nations. Mr. Brahimi went under very difficult circumstances and consulted with a lot of people and came up with what appears to be a very diverse government.","Now, I have just spoken to the Prime Minister and the new [INTERVIEWED] And I told them two things: One, thank you for taking on a very difficult assignment, thank you for leading; and two, America and our coalition will help you succeed, but it's up to you to succeed. You're in charge, and we will work with you to succeed.","[INTERVIEWER]. How much has the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib damaged the American moral authority and credibility?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes. Well, that's a very good question. Obviously, it was a shameful moment when we saw on our TV screens that soldiers took it upon themselves to humiliate Iraqi prisoners, because it doesn't reflect the nature of the American people or the nature of the men and women in our uniform. And what the world will see is that we will handle this matter in a very transparent way, that there will be rule of law, which is an important part of any democracy. And there will be transparency, which is a second important part of a democracy, and people who have done wrong will be held to account for the world to see.","That will stand this process will stand in stark contrast to what would happen under a tyrant. You would never know about the abuses in the first place. And if you did know about the abuses, you certainly wouldn't see any process to correct them.","President's Upcoming Visit With Pope John Paul II","[INTERVIEWER]. You will visit the Pope as well on June 4th.","[INTERVIEWED] Yes, sir.","[INTERVIEWER]. The Vatican opposed the war and now recommends, look forward and pay more attention to the religious and moral sensitivity of the Iraqi people. What's your opinion about this recommendation?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I can understand. Look, a lot of people didn't like the war. I understand that completely, and I don't like war. But I'm the guy who has to decide, for our case, whether or not a Saddam Hussein would be a threat to peace, and made a very difficult decision. After having tried all diplomacy, war was the last option.","Secondly, I will tell the His Holy Father I appreciate his positions he is a great man and that I look forward to working with the Iraqis to put in place the conditions so that human rights prevail, something that didn't happen under Sad-dam Hussein, looking forward to the development of a society in which boys and girls can go to schools and not be filled with hateful propaganda but with knowledge. I look forward to working with the health care workers in Iraq so that people can get decent health care. I will assure His Holy Father that we will do everything we can to elevate the human condition so that people can live in peace and freedom and remind him that a free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will serve as a great moment of change, will serve as an example for others to follow. You see, when the people in the Middle East see that a free society can exist in the Muslim world, they'll demand the same thing. And free societies are peaceful societies. Free societies are hopeful societies. And in the long run, the best way to defeat terror is to promote freedom, and that's what we're going to do.","[INTERVIEWER]. Last question.","[INTERVIEWED] Sure.","[INTERVIEWER]. If you cannot succeed with the United Nations, do you have a plan B as an exit strategy in Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED] We will succeed we will succeed with the United Nations.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's sure?","[INTERVIEWED] I'm confident. I'm an optimist. I've talked to most of the leaders on the Security Council. I've talked to the Russians, the Chinese, the Germans, the French, of course the Brits, and I know there is a consensus that we must work together for the good of the Iraqi people. This isn't about America. This is about Iraq and the citizens of Iraq who suffered under tyranny for so long. And now we have a chance to work together to promote a free society in a part of the world, by the way, that is desperate for free societies. And I know we'll succeed. I've got great faith in the future. And having talked to the new leadership some of the new leadership in Iraq I can tell you they share that same sense of destiny, the same great hope for their people.","[INTERVIEWER].

Okay.  [INTERVIEWED], a pleasure to be with you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, sir.","[INTERVIEWER]. You're about to travel to Lima, Peru, again. You're going to the APEC. And this is your last trip as [INTERVIEWED]","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. How would you like to remember both trip and APEC?","[INTERVIEWED]. I will first of all, I remember Peru fondly from my last visit in 2002, and I'm looking forward to going back. I think it will be said, when people analyze the relationship between the United States and Peru, that during my time in office and the time of [INTERVIEWED] Toledo and Garcia, we worked hard to put a good relationship in place.","And so, on the one hand, I'll be able to go and confirm the importance of the bilateral relationship, and then I'll go to a very important meeting. And APEC is an important meeting this time, particularly given the financial situation in the world. APEC comes right after the economic summit we had here in America. So it means that it has the chance to embrace the principles, but it also has a chance for countries that did not participate in the summit here in Washington to express their views.","So I'm looking forward to it. It's a very important meeting.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you built a relationship with Peru because you have a close friendship with [INTERVIEWED] Toledo","[INTERVIEWED]. Si.","[INTERVIEWER]. with former [INTERVIEWED] Toledo, which held the negotiations in favor of FTA","[INTERVIEWED]. Si.","[INTERVIEWER]. which was finally approved. Now we have [INTERVIEWED] Garcia in Peru, and elected [INTERVIEWED] Obama in your country. Do you think this new situation is going to change the relationships between the two countries?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I don't think so. I really don't. First of all, [INTERVIEWED] Garcia is muy amable. And [INTERVIEWED]-elect Obama will find him to be a straightforward man.","Secondly, the foundation is very strong. And so I anticipate and believe that bilateral relations with Peru and the United States will continue to be vibrant and strong and respectful. It's important for the American [INTERVIEWED] and I know [INTERVIEWED] Obama will be this way is to respect the leaders, the culture, and the people of the different countries.","[INTERVIEWER]. Let's talk about Latin America, [INTERVIEWED]. Sometimes it's said that at the beginning of your administration you were very interested in building up a strong relationship with Latin America, but 9/11 changed the priorities for the United States.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Is it true?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, it really isn't. I understand that. I mean, a lot of my well, you know, when I was on TV, for example, after 9/11, I was talking about securing the United States and the war on terror. And so I'm certain a lot of people in the neighborhood, Central and South America, said, \"Well, he's only focused on the Middle East; he doesn't really seem to care about us.\" But I've traveled. And in order to defeat that attitude, I came to Central and South America a lot as [INTERVIEWED]. I've been to your country twice. And secondly, more important than trips, though, is policy. Free trade agreements with nations in the region are important for development. Social justice programs focusing on health and education for citizens in the region are indicate our desire to help improve the human condition; the Millennium Challenge Account for countries in the region. So in other words, the record speaks about our deep desire to be good neighbors and to have friends.","[INTERVIEWER]. But some pundits said that the lack of policies in foreign affairs gears through Latin America empowered some political tyrants, like [INTERVIEWED] Chavez.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. No, I strongly disagree with that. I can understand pundits. There's a lot of pundits everywhere, but I believe that our policies have obviously set a different example of what's available for people. I mean, ours is a country that believes strongly in social justice. We believe good societies must have educated people. It's hard to be hopeful if there's not good health. And finally, ours is a country that promoted free and fair trade, which is the best way to help nations develop their economies. I mean, in other words, you're a Peruvian farmer, you'd like to be selling into U.S. markets, and because it's a big market. Nothing wrong with selling in the Peruvian market or in countries bor dering Peru or throughout South America. But also, it gives you an option to sell into U.S. markets. And that's the best way to help people make a living.","And we have obviously, there's a philosophical difference of opinion. And the only thing the United States tries to do is to show the human side of the philosophy that most leaders embrace, which is freedom, free markets, free trade, and social justice.","[INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], elected [INTERVIEWED] Obama said that at the very first day of his administration, he will withdraw troops from Iraq in a period of 18 months.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. It also is obvious that we are all in a middle of a huge global financial crisis. Do you think that this marks the end of an era which started with [INTERVIEWED] Reagan and highlighted the United States hegemony with both military and economically?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I don't think so. I think the United States is still going to be a leader. It's going to be important for whoever the [INTERVIEWED] is, whether it be obviously, [INTERVIEWED]-elect Obama, but [INTERVIEWED]s following that the United States builds close alliances and friendships. That's exactly what this administration does. I mean, the classic case is with Peru. We've worked hard to have a good, strong, bilateral relations. And the [INTERVIEWED]-elect is going to be facing difficult decisions. My job, as the sitting [INTERVIEWED], is to help him as he transitions into the job. I want him to succeed. And I want him to be able to have a economic platform that is good for the country. Now, obviously, we're in difficult times economically. We've taken some very strong measures here during my Presidency. And I'm very hopeful that these measures will make it easier for [INTERVIEWED]-elect Obama, not harder.","I've worked hard on a lot of fronts. I think America is more secure now than it was. Democracy is more vibrant in parts of the world that didn't see democracy. Trade is agreements are more abundant now. I have given it my all. And now I am very hopeful that the man who succeeds me as [INTERVIEWED] of the United States succeeds in his job.","[INTERVIEWED]ial Transition","[INTERVIEWER]. One last question, [INTERVIEWED] [INTERVIEWED]. Elected [INTERVIEWED] Obama said in his slogan, his campaign slogan, that change is the main thing for America.","[INTERVIEWED]. El cambio.","[INTERVIEWER]. El cambio, yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, when I campaigned for office, I said I was for change. Everybody who campaigns is for change. And that's a very effective slogan, and he ran a very effective campaign. And the American people spoke loud and clear.","And now it's it will be his turn in 2 months to assume the great honor of being [INTERVIEWED]. And I want to help him and help his team transition into office. And I really do wish him all the best. It's going to be very important that he be given a good start.

When did you first hear about the program, and why did it draw you?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm trying to remember whether I first heard about it from my wife or whether I read something about it. But I actually wrote a letter to John Sykes because I was so excited about what they were doing. I had been in school music when I was a young person, starting at the age of 9. And I had been really, really upset about all these schools dropping their music programs when I was Governor. And Hillary and I redid the school standards in Arkansas. We tried very hard to protect the music programs and the arts programs and the physical education programs for the people who weren't in team sports. And so I realized that all over the country these schools were under more and more financial pressure, and they thought that maybe the path of least resistance was just to get rid of the music programs. And so here was someone trying to do something about it. I was just thrilled, and I wanted to help.","Music in the [INTERVIEWED]'s Life","[INTERVIEWER]. Very cool. Growing up I know, I've watched a lot of tapes on you. We did \"Rock and Roll [INTERVIEWED]\" a while back with you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, in 1992. I loved it.","[INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. They gave me a copy of that. Music education was really important to you, obviously, growing up","[INTERVIEWED]. Really important.","[INTERVIEWER]. and music was really important. Looking at where you are now, arguably one of the most important people on the planet, what did music education do for you, and how has it come to play in your life now?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, it gave me an outlet for all this energy I had. It gave me a constructive way to be creative. It also taught me discipline, and it taught me that to create something beautiful required hard work and discipline. It taught me how to be to create alone and also how to work with a group, in a band, a jazz band or a combo. And it made me happy. I mean, it just made me happy. It's such a wonderful when I was a kid and I'd have a tough time, as long as I could play, I could always be okay. I could just be in a private place. And it fueled my imagination. And it gave me an appreciation of things in life that has stayed with me to the present day.","I can still go in my music room that Hillary built me upstairs in the White House and play for 15 or 20 minutes, and all the cares of the world go away.","Congressional Resolution on Music Education","[INTERVIEWER]. Very nice. So you guys have got to remember that when you're playing. Mr. Clinton said it.","Let's talk about, there was a resolution passed in Congress a few days ago, unanimous resolution, saying that music education was extremely important. Why is it so important that this was passed, and what's it going to do in the future?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it was important that it was passed because it shows that the Representatives of the people of both parties have now are acknowledging that it's important and it's a problem because there are so many schools that don't offer it anymore. And I think it will tend to increase public awareness of this, public support for maintaining the music programs.","The [INTERVIEWED]'s Advisory Commission on Music and the Arts did a study a couple of years ago, and Hillary was the honorary chair of the committee. They found that local pressure, parental involvement, community involvement was the single most important factor in either keeping or restoring music programs to the schools. And so I think that's why it matters.","I think also, though, the Congress and the [INTERVIEWED] have a responsibility to keep putting as much money out there to the schools to pay for their other expenses as possible the buildings, the teachers, to have smaller classes so the schools will have the money they need for the music programs.","But you know, there's lots and lots of research on this now which shows that if a good school music program increases academic performance, that a lot of young people learn in different ways and are dramatically stimulated by music. So that's another reason we ought to be for this. It actually will help the overall learning enterprise.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. That's an important point because I think everybody thinks of it as just an art, and it stops there","[INTERVIEWED]. Not true.","[INTERVIEWER]. and it's culture, and it carries through.","We've had a lot of artists helping us this week with \"VH1 Save The Music\" week and the \"Today Show.\" Mariah Carey was out yesterday; A.J. McLean from the Backstreet Boys; the Goo Goo Dolls. Today we have Bon Jovi playing at the \"Today Show\" in Rockefeller Center. Are you a Bon Jovi fan?","[INTERVIEWED]. He's great. I love Bon Jovi. I really I think he's great. I'm a music fan of his. I like his acting. He's doing very well in the movies now. And he's a marvelous young man. He's been to the White House to visit Hillary and me on several occasions. He's really he's a very nice man. And I'm pleased for his success, and I'm grateful that he's helping today.","[INTERVIEWER]. What does it say to the public to have such important sort of star power behind a program like \"VH1 Save The Music?\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I hope that it increases the public's awareness. I hope it says, hey, this is really important. I mean, these people could all be doing something else. And I hope it says to them, if all these people who do music for a living think it's important for all our kids to have access to music, maybe it is.","[INTERVIEWER]. All right. These guys do you go to this school, P.S. 96?","Audience members. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. All right, so the program and what's happening with the New York City school boards and public education and music and what's going on here today can you talk a little bit about what's being presented today and what's going to","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. If you look at these students here, VH1 has given them these instruments, so they're going to start a music program. Now, just a couple of years ago, this school had one of the worst performances in New York. And they've gone from having 80 percent of their kids not read at grade level to having three-quarters of their kids read at or above grade level in only 2 years. So they want this school to be one of the best schools in New York.","They have a school uniform policy, as you see, which is a very positive thing, I think. And now they want a music program. And what they know is not only will these children learn music and they'll enjoy it; it will further increase the academic performance of this school.","So I think they're all excited about it, and they're all proud of their school. Aren't you?","Audience members. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's just kind of exciting to have [INTERVIEWED] Clinton here, too, right?","Audience members. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. Oh, yes, just a little.","Audience member. An honor.","Music in the [INTERVIEWED]'s Life","[INTERVIEWER]. An honor. A big honor.","One last thing. TV moments, music moments on television what stands out in your mind as a huge one growing up, present day?","[INTERVIEWED]. When the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan. When Elvis Presley was on Ed Sullivan. I think those two things, when I was very young, made a big impression on me.","[INTERVIEWER]. Cool. All right. Thank you very much. I think you have to go back downstairs, so [laughter]. These are things I can't see what's going on, but I think my 5 minutes are up.","Thank you so much. It was such an honor.","[INTERVIEWED].  Thank you."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithregionalreporters","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. So I usually don't start these off with a long statement. Obviously, our overarching focus right now is the economy. I am very mindful of the hardships that are taking place all throughout the country: families who are losing their homes, losing their jobs, losing their health care. I get a sampling of the letters that are sent to me every day, and some of the stories are just heartbreaking.","And everything that we're doing is focused on not only pulling this economy out of what is the worst recession since the Great Depression, but also looking at ways that we can set a foundation for long-term economic growth. You know, the days of growing the economy through an overheated housing market or through people running up exorbitant credit card bills is over.","We've got to put our growth model on a different footing, and that means that we've got to deal with our health care system and reduce costs for families, businesses, and governments. It means that we have to think through our energy policy so that we're not so badly dependent on foreign oil. It means we've got to improve our education system so that our young people are equipped with the skills and knowledge that they're going to need to get jobs in the future.","And so the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that we passed reflected those priorities. You know, we had tax cuts to the middle class, but also investments on health information technologies and doubling renewable energy, a enormous effort to jump-start school reform at the same time as we are providing some much needed relief to States, so that they wouldn't be laying off teachers and firefighters and cops, and that we could rebuild our infrastructure.","The budget that I've now prepared and will be going before Congress and debated over the next month reflects many of those common priorities, and we're going to be building off of the progress that we made in the first 50 days. Now is the time, I think, for us to deal with health care in a serious way and start reducing costs as well as expand coverage. We're going to have to keep pushing on the energy front not just with things like the smart grid, but also figuring out how do we move to more renewable energies.","And on education, how do we build on the reforms that we talked about during the campaign and that are funded, at least temporarily, through the stimulus package. And I gave a major speech on education priorities yesterday.","I think that there's going to be some battles surrounding this budget, there always are. Obviously, at the same time, as we're moving this budget forward, I'm spending probably the majority of my time stabilizing the financial system. There are some who've argued that we can't do all of these things at once and that we should instead just focus on Wall Street and banking and not deal with the enormous pressures that families are feeling on a day-to-day basis. I think that would be a mistake. I think that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. And so even as we're working on financial stabilization, reregulating Wall Street, we're going to keep on pressing to get the investments that will ultimately lead to long-term economic growth.","So I also have Iraq and Afghanistan to deal with but I figured that would at least get us started. So why don't we just go around the room. I'll try to make sure that everybody gets a question. Since we've got somewhat limited time, I'll try to keep my answers short, if you guys can keep your questions short.","All right. Michael [Michael Coleman, Albuquerque Journal].","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], for having us today. Since we're only going to get maybe one shot, I want to ask you a question that's of great concern to the people of my State of New Mexico. And as you're fully aware, Mexico is besieged by drug-related violence. In my State there's a very real concern that this violence will spill over to the border; in a few cases, it already has. What specifically does the administration plan to do to help contain this violence? And on a related note, if there's anything you could say about immigration reform and when we might see some sort of action on that front?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, as you know, the first meeting with a foreign leader that I had after my election was with [INTERVIEWED] Calderon in Mexico, who I believe is really working hard and taking some extraordinary risks under extraordinary pressure to deal with the drug cartels and the corresponding violence that's erupted along the borders.","So this past week Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited with his counterparts in Mexico. Janet Napolitano, our director of Homeland Security, a border State Governor, has been convening meetings with all the relevant agencies and consulted with the Governors down there.","We expect to have a full a fully or a comprehensive approach to dealing with these issues of border security that will involve supporting Calderon and his efforts in a partnership, also making sure that we are dealing with the flow of drug money and the guns south, because it's really a two-way situation there. The drugs are coming north, we're sending funds and guns south, and as a consequence, these cartels have gained extraordinary power. And so, our expectation is to have a comprehensive policy in place in the next few months.","With respect to immigration reform, to some degree the collapse of housing construction in the country has slowed the flow of illegal immigrants coming into the country, but it remains a serious concern. And our approach is to do some things administratively to strengthen border security, to fix the legal immigration system, because a lot of the pressure or a lot of the impetus towards illegal immigration involves a broken legal system. People want to reunify families, and they don't want to wait 10 years.","I think we can make some progress on that front, and we've started to talk to all the parties involved and both parties here in Washington about the prospects of taking legislative steps. But, obviously, we've got a lot on our plate right now. And so what we can do administratively, that's where we're going to start.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], the numbers that came out today show that Indiana lost 59,400 manufacturing jobs last year. You've been in Elkhart; you've seen the ravage there. Aside from a bailout to the auto industry and the RV industry, are there policies that the State of Indiana ought to be embracing to strengthen its economy, or is the manufacturing sector in Indiana and elsewhere doomed?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, obviously, I come from a neighboring State, and if you think about northwest Indiana, it's as much a part of the Chicago regional economy as Indiana's. And so I'm very mindful of what's been happening. But I think that also points to where the opportunities are. Both Chicago and Indianapolis have done relatively well, those regions, because of a diversified economy. So what started off as hardcore traditional manufacturing towns made the transition to other areas: building on the universities, setting up research parks, thinking about innovative sectors in bio-medicine or in energy technologies.","And so part of what I think every State should be doing right now is figuring out, A, how do we invest in our people so that we're attracting world-class businesses who are looking for world-class employees? I think getting K-12 education right, not short-changing higher education, I think those things are absolutely critical; thinking about where can where do strategic infrastructure investments make sense. You know, if you think about the Midwest, one of the problems is, is that this is my stenographer. She just wants to make sure that I'm not tripping over myself.","One of the exciting things that we put in our stimulus package, for example, was high-speed rail, and is there an opportunity to connect Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, so that we're linking up some of these major metropolitan hubs in ways that provide us a competitive advantage in the world economy.","I think making sure that we are setting up research facilities or encouraging and attracting researchers, venture capital that spins off new technologies into commercial applications, some States do that better than others. Obviously, Silicon Valley is the best example of it, but Massachusetts, along Route 128, did it very well. There's no reason why working with some of the world-class universities that exist in the heartland in the Midwest that we don't adopt some of those same practices.","So we're going to do everything we can to preserve our manufacturing base. We have to recognize that some of those workers who used to manufacture steel now are going to be manufacturing solar panels. And we've got to make sure that they're equipped to do that. Okay?","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWER]. You named a special envoy today to oversee the closure of Guantanamo. I'd like to ask you about that. Among the places being possibly being considered as an alternative to those prisons is Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. There's a wall of opposition","[INTERVIEWED]. Where my mother was born, by the way.","[INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. There's a wall of opposition to that: local officials, people in the area, and plus from the congressional delegations of those States. How would you explain the rationale between the possibility if a place like Leavenworth would be chosen, the rationale behind that, and reassuring people of their safety and security?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, keep in mind, we haven't made any decisions on this. But also recognize that these individuals who have been imprisoned, many of whom are very violent or who have been detained, many of whom are violent and are pledging violence against the United States, once captured are similar to criminals who have engaged in violence of other types. They are a serious risk, but so are many of the people who are currently in prison. And we would not we would never put people into a situation that elevated the risks for surrounding communities. And that will, obviously, be something that we take very seriously as we're making these decisions moving forward.","But we already have experience with terrorists who are in Federal prisons. And there's been no indication that the safety and security of prison guards or the surrounding communities have been compromised as a consequence. That doesn't mean that it's not a serious issue. I recognize why people are concerned. We haven't made any firm decisions on this yet. But I have every confidence that we can determine the ultimate fates of those in Guantanamo in a way that's consistent with our values, consistent with our ideals, and that keeps us safe and secure.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], yesterday you called for eliminating restrictions on the number of charter schools, while enforcing some vigorous standards. In Ohio, the Governor has called charter schools a destructive influence on public education, a few years ago tried to have a moratorium on new charters, now wants to cut State spending by about 20 percent for charter schools and restrict some other funding. I'm wondering whether you've ever talked with him about this, and is this just a fundamental disagreement between the two of you?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, I haven't had a conversation with Governor Strickland. I know that part of his concern was prompted by some bad experiences with charters in Ohio that weren't up to snuff. And if you looked at my statement yesterday, what I said was, not only should we lift the cap on charters, we should also shut down charters that aren't meeting standards. I don't think that's inconsistent with Governor Strickland's position.","My goal here is to create laboratories of innovation so that in the public school system, we are on a race to the top as opposed to stuck in the old ways of doing things. And we've got to; we've got to do that. In your home town of Cleveland, I don't know off the top of my head what the dropout rate is, but I've got to assume that it's hovering around 50 percent. If you look at the number of children going through the Cleveland public schools who are actually prepared to go to college, it's probably 1 out of 7 or 8 or 10. And that's just not acceptable. It's not acceptable for them; it's not acceptable in terms of America's economic future. And so we've got to experiment with ways to provide a better educational experience for our kids, and some charters are doing outstanding jobs. So the bottom line is to try to create innovation within the public school system that can potentially be scaled up, but also to make sure that we are maintaining very high standards for any charter school that's created.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, I have to ask you an ethanol question.","[INTERVIEWED]. Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]. The biofuels as you probably know, your Agriculture Secretary is joining the ethanol industry and calling on the EPA to do an immediate increase in the ethanol limit to 12 or 13 percent, in advance of doing a higher 15 or 20 percent. Engine manufacturers, the automakers have been opposed to this. What is your position? Are you going to get involved in this decision by EPA?","[INTERVIEWED]. At some point I usually get involved. If it somebody explained to me that nothing comes to my desk if it's easy. It means that somebody else has solved it. And I suspect that this one will be reconciling a lot of different issues.","As you know, I've been a supporter of biofuels. I think it is an important ingredient in our overall energy independence. I've also said and I said during the campaign trail in Iowa, in front of farmers, that it was important for us to transition to the next generation of biofuels, that we've got to do a much better job of developing cellulosic ethanol, that corn-based ethanol, over time, is not going to provide us with the energy efficient solutions that are needed.","And I want to make sure, though, as somebody who comes from a corn-growing State, that the progress that we've made in building up a biofuels infrastructure and the important income generation that has come from ethanol plants, that that is sustained, that that's maintained. So our challenge, I think, is to see our current ethanol technology as a bridge to the biofuels technologies of the future. And that's what we want to invest in, and that's what I'll be directing my Department of Agriculture to focus on.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], you already mentioned the budget fight. I'd like to talk to you a little bit more about that, the one that's coming up. The budget outline is an extraordinary document in many ways and encapsulates a large part of the governing agenda that your administration has laid out. It's no surprise the Republicans don't really like it. But the interesting thing is, it may be the centrist Democrats who are the this evolving coalition of centrist Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and, to some degree, the Blue Dogs in the House, that are the real problem as they begin to look at the budget and find objections. Could you talk a little bit about that, the coming budget fight, but specifically what you can do to make sure that the vision in that document simply isn't dismantled as it goes through the messy budget process?","[INTERVIEWED]. Let me sort of provide you an overarching frame, because I think that, you know, there's the way that it has been discussed, I think, in some cases overstates the degree to which there's some massive transformational shift. On the other hand, in some ways it understates, I think, the significant reforms that are embedded in the budget.","So point number one, this is a pretty honest budget. You've got billions of dollars that we've put into the budget that for the last 8 years at least have never been acknowledged as costs. Fixing AMT, which is about $70 billion a year, that was just off the books; the war in Iraq, off the books. The way budgeting was done, it presumed that there was never, ever a national emergency arising out of a hurricane, a flood, or tornado; that none of them existed.","Now, if we had continued on had we applied the same gimmicks and tricks to our budget as folks have been putting up with for the last 8 years, including Members of Congress, we could make our numbers look really pretty. We thought that that was the wrong approach. So number one, we have provided, I think, a honest document of what the costs of Government are right now.","Second point is that on the revenue side, I campaigned during the election, and was not shy about it, that we needed to restore some balance to our Tax Code; that over the last decade, the average worker has seen no increase in their wages or incomes when you factor in inflation, just been flat, whereas the top 5 percent, but more particularly the top 1 percent, and even more particularly the top one-tenth of 1 percent, had seen extraordinary gains in their incomes. And what I said was, is that we needed to return to the tax structure that existed during the nineties under Bill Clinton and let the Bush tax cuts lapse. That's what this budget does.","Now, if you think about it, just to go back to the budget gimmick issue before, since 2001, part of the trick that had been perpetrated on the American people was to say that the Bush tax cuts would lapse in 2010, and that's why this wasn't a huge budget buster. So in effect, all we're doing is actually moving forward with the premise of the budget that the Republicans presented about 5, 6 years in a row, which was that this was supposed to lapse in 2010. For them to suggest now that this is some radical assault on the rich, I think, just makes no sense whatsoever.","Here's what we do, though, we say that on health care, energy, and education, it's time for us to make investments that had been put off for decades and had made us less competitive. And every dime of increased spending that we include in those areas we offset either with additional revenues or with cuts, and we cut a lot of stuff.","I mean, we're looking at billions of dollars of cuts out of Medicare's Advantage program, where we're subsidizing insurers but not making seniors any healthier. We are making significant cuts in procurement, $40 billion that we've identified by making sure that we're not engaging in the same no-bid contracting that has been such a problem.","In fact, if you look at the trajectory of our nondefense discretionary spending, which is what usually people think about when they think about whether a budget is loaded up with a bunch of nonessential spending, following our budget, we would drive nondefense discretionary spending down to the lowest levels since they started keeping records back in '62, much lower as a percentage of GDP than it was under Reagan or under Bush.","So really what the big arguments are going to be about are, number one, do you believe that now is the time for us to deal with health care in a serious way? And if you're serious about long-term fiscal responsibility and dealing with Medicare and Medicaid, then you can't say we're not going to deal with health care now. That's our biggest problem. If health care continues to go up at 6, 7, 8, 10 percent a year, then we can't solve our budget deficits, and we can't solve our national debt.","So I'm happy to have that argument with anybody. I also think that on the energy front, if we aren't willing to start putting a price on carbons that are contributing to climate change but also encourage us to use fossil fuels that we end up importing from other countries, then we can talk all we want about energy independence; we're not going to get there.","And on education, if we're pricing people out of the college market, if nobody wants to teach because teachers don't get paid much, if we're not investing in early childhood education, if we're not investing in science and technology, then we're going to fall behind.","So whether we're talking about Republicans or my fellow Democrats, my argument is going to be that these are the right priorities for America, these are the right priorities for long-term economic growth. Yes, they require some uncomfortable votes. If it was easy, I'm assuming it would have been done 20 years ago or 30 years ago. It's not easy, but it's the right thing to do.","The [INTERVIEWED]'s Staff/Food Safety","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I wanted to ask you about your Cabinet and your senior staff. By my count, you have about seven folks from the Midwest, six from the West, a crowd from the Northeast, and with maybe the exception of your able-bodied Press Secretary","[INTERVIEWED]. Gibbs?","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. Gibbs.","[INTERVIEWED]. He's the only Southerner?","[INTERVIEWER]. I think so.","[INTERVIEWED]. You guys are feeling neglected?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. So I'm wondering why is that, and what you don't like about the South?","[INTERVIEWED]. I love the South.","[INTERVIEWER]. And I'd also ask like to ask you about I think this is an unrelated question the Salmonella outbreak and food safety originated in Georgia, and what you think needs to be done about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, look, the I love the South. I've got to admit that we have thought a lot about finding the very best people for the jobs and haven't been thinking with great intensity about regionalism, because partly, except for food and sports teams and weather, I mean, we're one country. And I think that people are so mobile these days that I tend to think of ourselves as all just Americans. But if you've got some great Southerners who want to work for us, please let me know, because we're always open. I love the South.","Food safety is a serious concern, and I've directed both FDA I've directed both the Department of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to work to come up with a plan so that a lot of these different agencies that have some jurisdiction over food safety are integrated in a much more effective way and things aren't falling through the cracks.","There's a lot of work that needs to be done in working on the front-end with food producers so that there are better warning signals of potential problems than we have right now. And we also need to be able to trace sources of food contamination much more quickly than we're doing right now. And technology can be helpful, but the key is actually reorganizing the agencies that are responsible so that they're working more in concert than they are right now.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, and thanks for doing these. I actually have a follow up on FDA, and that is, do you still support that agency regulating tobacco, and if so","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. what's the timeline you'd like to see Congress working on that? And is the agency up to the task if we're still having just like we saw last month with the peanut butter food problems?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, we're probably going to have an announcement on this fairly soon, so I don't want to step on my own story, but I do think that the FDA has an important role to play on an issue that, obviously, has enormous impact on the health of the American people. That's all you're going to get out me there.","Go ahead.","[INTERVIEWER]. I have a question sort of similar to the Atlanta question. The Voting Rights Act, as you know, does not Birmingham","[INTERVIEWED]. I was just about to say, the don't I have some Birmingham people in my Cabinet?","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, Gibbs is from Auburn.","[INTERVIEWED]. There you go, it's close.","[INTERVIEWER]. The Voting Rights Act, as you know, does not apply especially section 5 does not apply to the entire country. The South is still required to get preclearance for election-related changes. There's an argument in Alabama, and I think some other Southern States, that they've sort of outgrown that; they no longer need that close scrutiny from the Justice Department to make those kinds of sometimes very simply changes. I know in 2006 you supported reauthorization, but do you still think the South needs this close supervision of Justice on under section 5?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I got to be careful here because I'm a law professor, so I may get too deep on the weeds on this stuff, get","[INTERVIEWER]. No, try it. Go for it.","[INTERVIEWED]. But the idea behind section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is that if there are discriminatory barriers to voting, that the Justice Department has some mechanism to actually deal with it; that you don't just leave it up to the States to self-correct, but that you've got some basis for intervention.","The most obvious kinds of violations don't happen very often these days, the classic being sort of the poll tax or the county clerk who just turns away African American voters. That's not really the key issue in the Voting Rights Act these days.","Typically, the issues that come up now have to do with whether there is a meaningful opportunity to select a candidate of your choice. If you've got a situation in which there is very racially polarized voting, and you've got, you know, 30 percent of the population is Hispanic or African American and the rest is majority white and it's a polarized part of the country and you've got at-large voting systems, well, it's conceivable that on a city council or a county board, you'd never have any African Americans or Hispanics on that board. So that's what section 5 of the Voting Rights Act does, is to try to preclear, see if there are any changes in the voting systems that would prevent people from exercising a meaningful vote.","The key concept, I think, in judging whether or not a jurisdiction still should be jumping through that hoop is probably the degree to which there are still highly racially polarized voting, under the parlance, racial black vote. And, you know, there are probably some parts of the South that were under section 5 that if you looked at the data are no longer that polarized. There are other parts that are probably still very polarized.","So I think it's the task of the courts to look and Congress, in future reauthorizations to look at the evidence and to see is that kind of polarization still taking place. And is that you know, it's not enough just to look and see is that 1 factor out of 10 or 15 factors, is it such a significant factor that, in fact, it's really preventing certain groups from having any representation whatsoever. So I guess that's all a long way of saying that you really have to look at the data and examine whether or not it still has some applicability.","The only other thing I'd the only other point I'd make about this is keep in mind that the preclearance is just that, it requires before you make a change to go before the DC Circuit or the Federal courts and just show that these changes aren't a problem. That's not such a huge hurdle to jump through. So I think it's legitimate to err on the side of caution before you started eliminating that requirement.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I wanted to follow up on the border question and the violence in Mexico. [INTERVIEWED] Calderon recently decided to send an additional 5,000 of his troops to the border. The Texas Governor has asked for a thousand U.S. troops or Border agents to reinforce the border on our side. What is the tipping point, in your mind, where the violence gets so bad that you need to act?","And related to that, you named a new drug czar today. You've taken that position out of the Cabinet. You, in the past, have talked about decriminalization of marijuana. Are we still engaged in a war on drugs?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me first start on the troop issue. We've got a very big border with Mexico. And so I'm not interested in militarizing the border. I am interested in providing the kind of in creating the kind of partnership with the Mexican Government that ensures the safety of U.S. citizens, the safety of Mexican citizens, and allows for the continued cross-border trade that's so important to the region.","If we're going to examine whether and if National Guard deployments would make sense and in what circumstances they would make sense as part of this overall review of our border situation, I haven't drawn any conclusions yet. I don't have a particular tipping point in mind. I think it's unacceptable if you've got drug gangs crossing our borders and killing U.S. citizens. I think if one U.S. citizen is killed because of foreign nationals who are engaging in violent crime, that's enough of a concern to do something about it.","With respect to what was the second question?","[INTERVIEWER]. If decriminalization of the marijuana laws","[INTERVIEWED]. I think what gave me pause on that question was I think you I'm not sure it's accurate to say that I well, the implication was somehow that I think we should weaken our drug laws. That's never been my position. I think that what we do have to I think the approach that we do need to take is to make sure that we have a both/and approach as opposed to an either/or approach. I think traditionally the debate is either interdiction, criminalization, longer drugs longer prison sentences for not only dealers, but users; that's one approach. And then the other approach would be sort of a public health, decriminalization approach.","My attitude is we do have to treat this as a public health problem, and we have to have significant law enforcement. And, you know, if we can reduce demand, obviously, that allows us to focus more effectively where interdiction is needed, where we've got to go after serious drug dealers and narcotrafficking.","Right now I think that we're fighting with one hand tied behind our back because our effort to lower demand is grossly underfunded, not as effective as it needs to be. The average person who is seeking serious substance abuse treatment in a big city like Dallas or Chicago typically has a 3-, 4-, 6-month waiting list to get enrolled in a program. I think that's a problem, and most law enforcement officials, I think, would agree that it is a problem.","Communication of Economic Stabilization Policy","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I have a general question about your overall communication strategy as [INTERVIEWED]. I mean, here we are on day 51, I think this is and I appreciate you talking to us regional reporters. You've done outreach with bloggers; I think you've done outreach to columnists across the political spectrum. There's still a lot of fear out there about the economy, the stock market. People aren't buying cars; they're not buying homes. Do you feel that you've done a good enough job so far in really laying out what the game plan is for your administration in tackling this financial mess that's pulled the rug out from under the economy?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, I think that we can always do a better job. Keep in mind, it's only been 2 weeks since I gave a joint session speech to Congress, the day after which everybody said, \"Boy, that was really clear,\" and, \"We have a clear sense of what's going on.\" You know, the reviews were pretty good. I recognize, I think, the degree of concern that people have.","We've been in office all of 7 weeks so far. This is a crisis that was 8 years in the making, maybe longer in some, you know, certain aspects of it. The buck stops with me, and we're responsible, but it's going to take some time. And the truth of the matter is that the American people, I think, understand that it's going to take some time. If you look at the public polling, they recognize it's going to take a while to dig ourselves out of the hole.","We passed the stimulus package, and I've been talking almost every day about elements of the stimulus package, the recovery package that are going to be having an immediate impact in the various hometowns that you represent. I think Mayor Rybak, the day we signed it, talked about the 57 police officers that wouldn't be laid off as a consequence of the stimulus.","So I think people are getting the message that slowly, surely we are making progress on these fronts. We released a housing plan that is providing significant relief, and you're already starting to see an uptick in refinancings that are providing families with relief. And in certain pockets of the country you're starting to see housing prices stabilize after a long drop.","You know, I think the one area where there's still significant uncertainty has to do with the bank issue. And that's obviously a particular concern to Wall Street. The challenge for us there is that we are in the process of undergoing or conducting these stress tests of the banks to get a better sense of what their capital positions are and how strong they are. And what we don't want to do is to prejudge those tests or make a lot of statements that cause a lot of nervousness around banks that are already having difficulty right now.","So on that particular issue, you know, we've got to, I think, explain to the American people and as I said, we can always to do better why it is so important to get lending going again, get credit flowing to businesses and consumers. I'll be making statements about this tomorrow, the next day, in my radio addresses, next week. And the main message that I'm going to be delivering is that it's going to take some time to get out of this deep hole we're in, but we're going to get out of it.","The other message, though, is that there are no shortcuts to long-term economic growth, and we can't just keep on doing the same things that we were doing before and somehow expect that all our problems are going to be solved. We've got to tackle some of these things like health care, energy, and education that have been put off for too long.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I have a question about NASA, in honor of the Discovery launch tonight. Right now, the retirement of the space shuttle in 2010 is going to devastate the space coast economy down in Florida. You're looking at about 3,500 job losses, at the least, at the center, which will multiply to as many as 28,000 jobs throughout that entire area.","Right now, you reaffirmed [INTERVIEWED] Bush's decision to retire the shuttle in 2010. I guess what I want to know is why you decided to keep that 2010 retirement date for the shuttle and what type of plans you may have to try to save the space coast from an economic crater?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, first of all, we've authorized, and we're budgeted for, additional shuttle launches that had not been scheduled. And so we're extending the life of the shuttle, because, A, I think it is doing some important work, and B, we're very mindful of the economic impact of the space program in the region.","I will soon be appointing a new NASA director. I think it's important for the long-term vibrancy of our space program to think through what NASA's core mission is and what the next great adventures and discoveries are under the NASA banner.","NASA has yielded or the space shuttle program has yielded some extraordinary scientific discoveries. But I think it's fair to say that there's been a sense of drift to our space program over the last several years. We need to restore that sense of excitement and interest that existed around the space program. And shaping a mission for NASA that is appropriate for the 21st century is going to be one of the biggest tasks of my new NASA director.","Once we have that vision, then I think it's going to be much easier to build support for expanding our space efforts. But what I don't want NASA to do is just sort of limp along here. And I don't think that's good for the economy of the region either.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in appointing a FEMA Administrator last week, were you signaling your intention to keep the agency as part of the Department of Homeland Security? And now that you've sent some Cabinet members to New Orleans, might we expect your presence in the city, perhaps even for the new hurricane season?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm just still trying to figure out my schedule for tomorrow so I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Sending Secretary Donovan and Napolitano signaled that we're going to be focused on New Orleans's reconstruction, and we're going to be paying a lot of attention to the systems that are in place to protect from hurricanes in the future.","And I what was the first question?","[INTERVIEWER]. On FEMA, and whether FEMA stays within DHS.","[INTERVIEWED]. FEMA I have not made a final decision on that. But whether FEMA stays inside DHS or is once again a standalone agency, the one thing you can be certain of is that it's going to do an outstanding job performing its tasks. And I think that the new director has gotten uniformly high grades. Whenever you got Haley Barbour, Jeb Bush, and Democrats in Congress agreeing on somebody, they know what they're doing.","Republican Opposition/High-Speed Rail","[INTERVIEWER]. Thanks, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]. I wondered if, first, you could elaborate as a [INTERVIEWED] from Chicago, a little bit on your own vision for high-speed rail in the Midwest, particularly the idea of a Chicago-to-Milwaukee-to-Twin Cities link.","And then a completely unrelated political question, whether you're at all surprised by the degree of, sort of, discipline and unity we're seeing in a Republican opposition to your agenda right now?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, let me answer the political question first. I'm not surprised, because opposition is always easy; saying no to something is easy. Saying yes to something and figuring out how to solve problems and governing, that's hard. And on this budget debate, for example, if you've got people who on the one hand say, \"We want to bring down the long-term deficit, but we don't want to cut certain programs that are important. Oh, and by the way, we don't want to raise taxes\" well, sounds good. And I'd like to make sure that the Chicago Bulls win the championship every year and the White Sox win the Series, but you know, show me how you're going to do it.","So I'm not impressed by just being able to say no. I think what will be interesting is the degree to which my Republican colleagues start putting forward in the form of an affirmative agenda that's not based on ideology, but on the very real struggles and pain that people are feeling right now around the country, and how do we get this economy back on its feet.","In terms of high-speed rail, I think there's enormous opportunities here. Now, I would have loved to have seen more done on high-speed rail in the recovery package, because I think it's the right direction for us to go in. I could not credibly claim that all of the investments that are necessary are short term enough to be in a recovery package, as opposed to be part of our broader transportation bills and budget.","But think about it. I mean, we've laid a transcontinental railway system during the Civil War. Railroads were always the pride of America and stitched us together. Now Japan, China, all of Europe have high-speed rail systems that put ours to shame. And the potential economic benefits of a high-speed rail link between Chicago and Milwaukee, so that people are avoiding I-94, or the length between Chicago and St. Louis, Detroit, all those Midwestern cities, I think is enormous, and is a very real option with although gas prices are low right now, it becomes a very meaningful option for people who don't want to take off their shoes, drive to an airport, pay for parking, suffer delays. So I think there's a very real opportunity.","I should point out that the opportunities around the rail are not just in high-speed rail. I mean, there's some basic freight rail issues in Chicago, Milwaukee, the Midwest that can also be solved and would help with the whole distribution of goods in the region that would save business a lot of money. And I hope that we end up spending some time focused on that during the transportation reauthorization.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], thanks again for doing this. Given the worldwide context of the economic crisis you're dealing with, are the stimulus measures that you've championed, in your mind, sufficient to right the economy, absent similar actions by other large economies in the world?","And if I could just turn the question around in a way, there are estimates of, like, a hundred million have been plunged into poverty worldwide. Does the U.S. do you have any interest in their situation, whether from the standpoint of self-interest, national security, or morality?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's a great question. I anticipated this question, even though I didn't know you were going to ask it, Jim [James O'Toole, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette], because Secretary Geithner is now headed off to the G-20 finance minister's meeting as a precursor to our G-20 meeting. And what we specifically talked about was, number one, our economic recovery is linked up to the economic recovery of the rest of the world and vice versa. Up until a few months ago, exports were one of the few bright spots in our economy.","The collapse of worldwide demand costs American jobs and American businesses. And so we want to work with other countries to make sure that they're promoting the kinds of fiscal stimulus packages that can boost demand in their countries. It's important that we don't fall into a protectionist mentality so that each country, even as it's stimulating, is also still promoting the kinds of trade that can help us all grow.","And part of the G-20 agenda is also thinking about the adverse impact that this global economic slowdown is having on the poorest of the poor. I think we have all of the above, a moral, national security, and economic interest in making sure that people in those countries are not suffering even more than they were already suffering, because that can be profoundly destabilizing in all sorts of ways.","You know, there were a couple of questions about the border situation with Mexico. You know, if Mexico's economy cannot provide a living wage of any sort to a growing Mexican population that, obviously, is going to put more pressure on us in terms of immigration, more people being pushed into the drug trade, and so on.","And that's just one example. There are more severe examples of instability in places like North Africa in the face of drought or shortage of food supplies that can end up causing us real problems.","So figuring out how the developed countries, wealthier countries, even in the midst of hardship, can provide some relief and assistance to those countries as well, I think, is going to be very important.","All right? Okay, guys. You put me through the paces.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you much.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]. I broke a sweat.","[INTERVIEWER]. You didn't break a sweat.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Take care."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreligiousaffairsjournalists","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm glad to see you all and welcome you here, for many of you, for the first time. As you know, in the State of the Union Address I issued a challenge, and as part of my explanation of the New Covenant in challenging citizens to be more responsible, to people of faith and to religious leaders specifically to help us to deal with those problems that we have to deal with person by person and from the inside out, to help us to deal with the problems of teen pregnancy and outof-wedlock birth, to help us to deal with the challenges of excessive violence, to help us to deal with the things that have to be organized and dealt with literally one by one at the grassroots level. And while I think we have to be more tolerant of all people, no matter what their differences are, we need to be less tolerant of conditions that are within our power to change.","And as you know now, for 2 years, ever since I took this job, I've been trying to find ways to galvanize the energies of people of faith to work together on a common agenda that nearly all Americans would agree on and, at the same time, to try to respect the differences of opinion and views. Our administration strongly supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and we've worked very hard to implement it in a good faith way. And I think an awful lot of people from right across the spectrum of religious affiliations in our country would agree that we have done that.","Anyway, if you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer. But the other thing I was going to say today what I said today was that the problems our country faces today are quite profound, you know, the fact that a rising tide is not lifting all boats; that a lot of people, in spite of this remarkable recovery, have not gotten a raise and they're more vulnerable with their health care, their pensions; and the fact that a lot of people find their values violated and their security violated by crime and violence and the breakdown of the social order. It would be very hard to assert that there are more profound difficulties than the problems of previous days, than the problems that George Washington or Abraham Lincoln or Franklin Roosevelt confronted.","The difference is that in the information age, which gives us these vast new opportunities because the creation of wealth is based on knowledge and that these people have access to more knowledge than ever before, it's also a great burden because words have greater power today than ever before, not only to build up but also to tear down, to divide, to destroy, to distract. And therefore, in a very profound sense in the modern world, it is more important that people be striving for the kind of spiritual presence of mind and peace of mind that will lead you to use words to build up and to unify, instead of to divide and tear down. And I really do believe that. I think that it's clearly different from any previous time. Words have always been able to wound in letters or speeches or whatever. But the omnipresence of information today and the fact that we're buried in it, it seems to me, imposes an even greater responsibility on people in positions of respect and trust and power to use those words more carefully.","[INTERVIEWER]. An awkward question, sir. The moral crusade elements of the State of the Union Address, teenage pregnancy, as an example, sits well, except that there are investigations into your own conduct which some people say leaves an impression. Is this interfering with your ability to lead that type of crusade?","[INTERVIEWED]. Not in my own mind. That's up for other people to determine. But the one thing that I would say today we live in an age where anybody can say anything and, unlike in previous times, it gets into print. And even if they admit they took money to say it which is what happened in my case a couple of times it still gets wide currency. So there's not much I can do about that.","I can tell you this: The work I've tried to do to reduce teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births generally is something I've been involved in for many years. And I think it's a very serious matter. The life of these young people was very, very different than my life was when I was their age. Their temptations, their travails, it's very, very different and much more difficult for them. And I think we've got to try to find a way to help them walk back from what is now happening.","Interestingly enough this is a statistical comment I'm making now there is some evidence that the efforts may be beginning to have some impact. The actual numbers of out-of-wedlock births have stabilized in the last 2 or 3 years. The rate of illegitimacy is going up because the rate of childbearing by couples who are young and successful is going down, which is another problem for another discussion. But anyway, I don't see that we have any choice as a people to deal with it, and it's and you know, if folks want to use that as another excuse to attack me, that's their problem, not mine.","[INTERVIEWER]. Related to that, some people suggest that both your welfare reform proposals and the Contract With America's welfare reform proposal takes such Draconian measures against these unwed teen mothers in terms of limits that what it's likely to do is to drive up the abortion rate, not stop the unwanted pregnancy rate but drive up the abortion rate. Do you see that happening?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't agree with that in my proposal, and obviously I don't know what would happen in the others, but let's look at that.","The abortion rate has been going down in America. And I think it's been going down for maybe because of all the protest against abortion. But I also think that most Americans have deeply ambivalent feelings. That is, I believe that a majority of Americans are pro-choice and anti-abortion. That is, they don't believe that the decision should be criminalized because there are too many different circumstances where most of us feel that decisions should be left to the people who are involved rather than having a totally legal prohibition. On the other hand, most people think in most circumstances that abortion is wrong and that it shouldn't be done.","So the abortion rate is going down in America. It's still very much too high, and we've tried to do some things to make adoption more attractive. And there was a law signed last year, that's gotten almost no notice because it was part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to try to remove the prohibitions or the discriminations in courts across the country in cross-racial adoptions to try to do whatever we could to just encourage more adoptions.","But let me back up to your question and to explain, if I might, why I don't agree that our position would cause more abortions. There are basically three different approaches, with a zillion different limitations, but three different approaches in this welfare debate. There is the Contract approach which is deny benefits to the second welfare child born out of wedlock. And then this extreme version is deny benefits to any teenager who has a child out of wedlock and to that child for up to 18 years. That's what then there's the people who say, turn it over to the States and let them do whatever they want, which could include that.","Our position is give the States a lot more flexibility, but don't punish the children; take care of their basic needs. And we say don't cut the parents off of public assistance unless, number one, they're bad parents or, number two, they do things which will undermine their ability to either be successful workers or successful parents.","So for example, the way our plan works is if you're a teenager and you have a baby, in order to draw the public assistance in a normal way you'd have to stay in school, you'd have to live at home with your parents, and if you lived in a bad home you'd have to live in some other supervised setting. You'd have to cooperate and help identify the father so we could attempt to get the father to pay child support and support the child. If at the end of your education period and training, if 2 years have elapsed and you haven't gone to work, then you would have to go to work if there were a job available. And if you turned down a job, you could lose your benefits. Under their proposal, the second problem is, you'd be cut off after 2 years whether there's a job there or not.","So the two differences are, I say cut people off after a limited amount of time if there's a job there. They say cut them off altogether. I say only take benefits away from people if they misbehave as parents or in their own responsibilities. They say if you have a child out of wedlock and you're a teenager, you should never get benefits and neither should your child.","I'll leave it to you to conclude what impact that might have on the abortion rate; I don't know. But I don't believe ours would. I think ours is responsible. You have to have more requirements on people; you can't just continue to perpetuate the present system. But I don't think you should punish the children or punish people for their past mistakes. You should deal with their present conduct.","[INTERVIEWER]. What about the suggestion that, particularly of Speaker Gingrich, that the churches and the charities should be able to take over much of the responsibility, including the financial responsibility that the Government now has for foster children and various other tough social situations? Is that an appropriate way for these problems to be taken care of, for these people to be cared for? And if so, how should the money get there?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think the churches could well be involved in more activities. For example, I think that you might and one of the things that I want to do is to give more flexibility in how to implement welfare reform to State and local government. If they want to involve the church, particularly, for example, in developing supervised settings for young girls and their children who can't, and shouldn't, be living in their homes because of the problems in their homes, that's the sort of partnership that I would certainly not oppose.","But I don't think you can say from that that there's no national interest which should command some taxpayer support to make sure that these children have minimal levels of nutrition and medical care and just the basic things that it seems to me we've got an interest in doing, because we don't want to lose any more of these kids than we have to.","The welfare benefits themselves, by the way, are not a problem. The real welfare benefits are about 40 percent lower than they were 20 years ago. So nobody goes on welfare for the check. It's the child care; it's the food stamps; it's the medical care for your children. Therefore, nearly anybody who can will get off and go to work if they can take care of their children and their children won't lose their health care.","But do I think the churches should do more? I do. And one of the things that we want to do is to give more operational control of this program to the States and let them use churches or community organizations or others to do whatever they can to repair the families.","[INTERVIEWER]. Much of what the churches already do for instance, Catholic Charities, their money comes from contracts through Federal agencies. In essence, what some of the Republican proposals are asking them to do is to continue doing the sort of work but without those contracts, without the money.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it will just be harder for them, won't it? I mean, I think I mean, Fred is a good example. The Government does not we are not a particularly generous country in terms of social welfare. The thing I don't think the American people object to spending tax money on poor people. I think what they object to is spending tax money on a system that perpetuates destructive conduct and irresponsible conduct. I think that the issue is for example, I don't think most Americans really think that it would be a great idea to cut out all spending on poor children in order to afford a capital gains tax cut. I don't think that's where they would come down. On the other hand, would they rather have a tax cut or just waste money on any program, including a program that perpetuated dependency? I think they would or reduce the deficit or whatever.","So I think the what my goal is, is to say there's a national interest in the health and welfare of our children. I think it requires some investment of taxpayer money in the areas of particularly basic health care and nutrition and immunization of children against serious diseases. But the systems are dysfunctional. So I think we ought to try to fix them.","[INTERVIEWER]. In a meeting of Baptist leaders back in October you were asked a question about some of your critics who were attacking you with unsubstantiated charges. I'm thinking specifically of Reverend Falwell pushing a video on his TV program. And your response to the question was that you were busy running the country and didn't want to respond to your critics, but you were surprised that the Christian community wasn't taking these men on.","Since that time, I know American Baptist Tony Campollo was asked for equal time on his show to try to defend you. But do you know of any other attempts like that, or anything since that time to try to answer some","[INTERVIEWED]. There have been an awful lot of attempts I think there have been a lot of press stories refuting some of the specific allegations. But I would just say again, in the world we're living in I'll say what I said at the prayer breakfast today there is an inordinate premium put on the use of words to destroy or to distract people. And it takes away from my ability to be [INTERVIEWED], to do the job with a clear head and a clear heart and to focus on the American people, if I have to spend all my time trying to answer charges about what people say that I did years ago. And I just can't do it; I just can't do it.","I do the very best I can. Sometimes you can actually disprove something someone says about you. A lot of times, some people could lie about you in ways that you can't disprove. You can't always disprove every assertion. So insofar as whatever happened, I can't change yesterday, I can only change today and tomorrow. So I've just got to keep going. I think it is I think I have if I'd done anything, even though I've tried not to deal with it at all, I think whatever time I've spent kind of trying to absorb those blows since I've been [INTERVIEWED] has been time and effort and energy, emotional as well as intellectual energy, has taken away from the American people. And I'm not going to cheat them anymore; I'm just not going to do it. I'm tired of letting other people say things that require me to deprive the American people of the best effort I can make. They'll have to make whatever evaluation of this they want to.","There is a difference between reputation and character, and I have increasingly less control over my reputation but still full control over my character. That's between me and God, and I've just got to try to be purified by this.","I also noticed, Winston Churchill said I ran across this the other day that just because someone strays from the truth in criticizing you doesn't mean you can't learn something from their criticism. So I've decided that I'll try need to learn a little something from my critics, even if what they say is not so. None of us are perfect, and I'm certainly not. But I just can't I really think I made the right decision to try to just tune it out and go forward.","[INTERVIEWER]. Is there a place in the Scriptures where you find a source for the kind of faith you talked about earlier and stillness in facing these things, a story or a parable or a reading that you've turned to?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, it's interesting, I just finished reading the entire Psalms. I also read this is ironic Lloyd Ogilvie's book on the Psalms that I didn't I read it before he was selected to be Chaplain of the Senate. And there are a lot of the Psalms where David is sort of praying for the strength to be sort of purified in the face of adversity and in the face of his own failures.","There are a lot of the Proverbs which talk about the importance of keeping a quiet tongue and at least not getting in your own way, which I've done a lot in my life and which I've tried, even still, to grow out of. And I've spent a lot of time dealing with that over the last 2 years, as you would imagine I would have to.","I think the important thing, and I find this in the Scriptures over and over again, the important thing that I have to keep focusing on is what am I going to do today, what am I going to do tomorrow, how can I be free to call on the power of God to make the most of this job that I have for a little bit of time in the grand sweep of things. And that's just what I keep focusing on every day.","But I think you'd be amazed how many people write me little fax notes, from friends of mine on a daily basis, saying look at this Scripture, look at that Scripture, look at the other Scripture. During this difficult period, a lot of people were giving me different Psalms to read it was amazing and so I did.","[INTERVIEWER]. Sir, when you talk about destructive language, if you you refer to personal attacks on yourself. But what about some of the uncivil language which has been so much in the news over the past months that has been in Congress? Are you including that in","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, sure. I said today at the prayer breakfast, I don't think anybody in public life, including me, is blameless. I think it's that there are general excuse me, genuine differences that people have on issues, and they ought to express them. But our public life needs more of the spirit of reconciliation, it needs more civility, it needs more humility. Sometimes we think we know things we don't.","And I think on debates over public issues, that is true as well. The American people very much want us to they respond to these negative things, but they don't like it. The reason it keeps happening is because they respond to it. The politicians read polls, you know, and they know very often that the negative campaigns work and elect people. And they know that if you just constantly demean and run down people, like, after a while it sticks. They know that, so they keep on doing it. And the people respond to it, but they hate it. It's almost saying, \"I wish you'd lock this liquor store up so I couldn't drink anymore.\"","And so somehow we have to crawl back off of this wedge because it has, as I said, it's  today people get more information that is sort of argumentative and editorial and often less accurate, and then get in a more negative context than ever before. And it is a function of the information explosion. And so I do believe that I and others have a heavier responsibility even than we might have had in a former time, when in order to just get people's attention, you might take a little license with your language, you know.","[INTERVIEWER]. proven through the words and your actions that you are a genuinely religious person, since you were very young, and your wife as well. And a lot of religious people I talk to don't seem to accept that, who don't seem to feel it's genuine, feel that you're using it in the course of making politics. And I'm wondering why, if you believe that, too, and if you any analysis as to why that is and what it might say about the role of religion in politics, whether they really ought to be bound together","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think they should be bound together. I mean, I think the First Amendment is a good thing for our country, that we protect the right of everybody to be faithful to whatever they believe by not uniting church and state. But I don't think you can change people or who they are. They have the convictions they have. They have the beliefs they have.","And what I've tried to do is to draw the proper balance by encouraging people of all faiths, including people who disagree with me, to be activist citizens. I think the the book that Stephen Carter wrote on that, he makes a better statement about that than I can make, in terms of why they don't accept that about me. I think it's hard to make a case that I have tried to use this. I've never tried to say that for example, I never tried to say that there was a Christian coalition behind anything I did, you know, that God had ordained us to do these following things and I knew it, and anybody that didn't was seized by the Devil. I never said that.","I've said that like every other person, I consider myself a sinner because I believe I consider myself forgiven. I consider you know, I need the power of God. This is a humble thing for me. But it's an important part of my life and has been for a long time, but especially again in recent years and before I became [INTERVIEWED]. And the same thing is true for Hillary.","I think the truth is that there are people who don't believe it's genuine because they disagree with me politically. They don't believe that you could be a committed Christian and not want to criminalize all abortions. \"I just don't believe you can be\" that's what they think. They don't believe that you could be a committed Christian and believe that take the position that I took on gays in the military. They thought think the Bible dictated the previous policy on gays in the military, even though we fought two World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam with a different policy. But they don't believe that. That's their conviction.","So then I think there are people, once they disagree with you so much, who will believe who will believe in perpetuating anything anybody says about you, and so they think that's evidence of that. But you know, the Bible is full of refutations of the latter point. All they had to do was read the Scripture to know better than to make that argument. But I can't worry about them; that's their problem. Let them think what they want.","I literally you know, the one thing I realize is, is I wasted too much time when I got here, and it caused me to be a less effective [INTERVIEWED], either being hurt by or paying a great deal of attention to what people said about me in the past. And I've just got to try to keep going and fight against it, because the people that wanted to really blow that up either wanted to do it for their own purposes or wanted to do it literally without regard to whether the Government of the United States functions or the public interest is furthered. It's just a crazy way to behave; you can't do it. It never happened before in our history to this extent, and it shouldn't be happening now. And if it is happening, I can't control it. So what I should do is just do my job and shut it out; that's what I have to do.","[INTERVIEWER]. Sir, do you think that religious groups such as the Christian Coalition risk their credibility by wholesale endorsement of the Contract With America?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think that's for others to judge, I think, but I would say this: You know, I think that they will come to be seen more and more like a political party with an agenda, rather than people who are driven into politics based on one or two issues that they believe the Bible dictates a position different from the present policy of the United States.","And there are a lot of European political parties with the name \"Christian\" in them, the Christian Democratic Party in Germany, Helmut Kohl's party. Nobody considers him to be, how should I say, sacrilegious because he's part of a party called the Christian Democratic Party that has religious roots, but no one anymore seriously believes that every position they take is rooted in their reading of the Scripture. And I think that the Christian Coalition is long since at that point.","Now, the thing I do think they have to be careful about with their credibility is the very, very hard hits they put on office holders who don't do as they believe. I remember one of the Members of Congress who lost in the last election told me of an encounter with a Christian Coalition minister who said to this Member, \"Well, you want to see what we're going to put out in our churches on Sunday, tomorrow?\" And she said, \"Yes, I'd like to see it.\" And she went to these ten items; she said, \"But these two things aren't true.\" He said, \"So, it's generally true. So what?\"","So I think that that could hurt their credibility more than anything else, the idea that they're using the emotions of people of faith who are deeply disturbed for good reasons with what's going on in our country today and channeling those emotions into convictions about people in public life that aren't true. Now, that could hurt their credibility.","But I think just taking positions on these other things, I think everybody knows that they basically are an arm of the Republican Party and that they're going to take all these positions. I don't see that there's anything wrong with them doing it. And I agree with some of them, too. You know, I don't disagree with everything in that Contract; I agree with some of it.","Did everybody get a question? I'm glad to see you.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's good to see you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thanks. Do you ever wish you were back in Conway?","[INTERVIEWER]. Almost every day when I'm driving out to Fairfax County for that hour and a half. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. It's pretty out there. I had a woman today from Lonoke come sing at the prayer breakfast. It made me so homesick I could hardly stand it."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone0","text":["[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you all for coming. A couple of points I want to make to you. First, I'm excited about the energy initiative. American people are beginning to see that we've made good progress on research and development. We've got more to do. We're close to some breakthroughs that will achieve an economic and national security objective.","And I've enjoyed traveling around and talking to these scientists and engineers that are really excited about how close we are to some technological breakthroughs. Today, talking to the two scientists involved with the cellulosic ethanol projects was exciting. These guys are pretty fired up about it all, and they realize we've got a chance to change our driving habits.","I do want to talk about this port issue. A foreign company manages some of our ports. They've entered into a transaction with another foreign company to manage our ports. This is a process that has been extensively reviewed, particularly from the point of view as to whether or not I can say to the American people, \"This project will not jeopardize our security.\" It's been looked at by those who have been charged with the security of our country. And I believe the deal should go forward. This company operates all around the world. I have the list somewhere. We can get you the list. They're in Germany and elsewhere—Australia.","They—in working with our folks, they've agreed to make sure that their coordination with our security folks is good and solid. I really don't understand why it's okay for a British company to operate our ports but not a company from the Middle East, when our experts are convinced that port security is not an issue; that having worked with this company, they're convinced that these—they'll work with those who are in charge of the U.S. Government's responsibility for securing the ports—they'll work hand in glove. I want to remind people that when we first put out the Container Security Initiative, the CSI, which was a new way to secure our ports, UAE was one of the first countries to sign up.","In other words, we're receiving goods from ports out of the UAE as well as where this company operates. And so I, after careful review of our Government, I believe the Government ought to go forward. And I want those who are questioning it to step up and explain why all of a sudden a Middle Eastern company is held to a different standard than a Great—British company. I'm trying to conduct foreign policy now by saying to people of the world, \"We'll treat you fairly.\" And after careful scrutiny, we believe this deal is a legitimate deal that will not jeopardize the security of the country and, at the same time, send that signal that we're willing to treat people fairly.","Thirdly, I'm looking forward to my speech tomorrow about my trip to India and Pakistan. It's going to be an important trip, one where we'll work on a variety of issues with both countries—security, prosperity, and trade—working with India, of course, on energy security. It will be an important trip.","I'll answer some questions, and then we're getting ready to land.","Dubai Ports World/Homeland Security","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], leaders in Congress, including Senator Frist, have said that they'll take action to stop the port control shift if you don't reverse course on it. You've expressed your thoughts here, but what do you say to those in Congress who plan to take legislative action?","[INTERVIEWED]. They ought to listen to what I have to say about this. They ought to look at the facts and understand the consequences of what they're going to do. But if they pass a law, I'll deal with it, with a veto.","Crude Oil Supply/Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], on energy and foreign policy, some Saudi officials have said they're unhappy with being targeted about Middle Eastern oil, saying that you wanted to reduce dependence on Middle East oil. You've got a close relationship with King Abdullah.","[INTERVIEWED]. I do.","[INTERVIEWER]. He's been to see you. Have you heard something directly, yourself, from the Saudis?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I haven't talked to His Majesty, but if I did, I would say, I hope you can understand that the relationship between supply and demand is so tight that any disruption on the supply side of energy causes our prices to go up, and spiking prices hurts our economy. And secondly, there are parts of the world where people would—that don't agree with our policy, namely Iran, for example. And that it's not in our interest to be dependent, when it comes to our economic security, and for that matter, national security, in a market that is volatile. And so hopefully, he'll understand.","[INTERVIEWER]. So you don't think they should take offense at the comments about Middle Eastern oil?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would think that he would be understanding that new technologies will enable us to diversify away from our reliance upon crude oil. As a matter of fact, it's not only a message for the United States; that's also a message for India and China. In order for these growing economies to be able to be competitive, they're going to have to learn how to use technologies that will enable them to meet the needs of their people, but also the international demands of the world for good environment, for example. The Nuclear Energy Initiative I'll be talking to the Indians about is an important initiative.","Dubai Ports World/Homeland Security","[INTERVIEWER]. The understatement today, and one of the concerns of lawmakers, seems to be that they want more of a briefing, and they want more details about the things that you know that have given you confidence that there aren't any national security implications with the port deal. Are you willing to either have your staff or to give any kind of briefing to leaders of Congress——","[INTERVIEWED]. Look at the company's record, Jim [Jim VandeHei, Washington Post], and it's clear for everybody to see. We've looked at the ports in which they've operated. There is a standard process mandated by Congress that we go through called the CFIUS process. I'm not exactly sure if there's any national security concerns in briefing Congress. I just don't know. I can't answer your question.","[INTERVIEWER]. It seems like—you've already heard from different administration officials, saying, not in as strong terms as you have today, that there aren't problems with this deal, that the deal should go forward. But they seem to want more of a briefing. Would you be willing to give any additional briefings, either——","[INTERVIEWED]. We'll be glad to send——","[INTERVIEWER]. ——either in a classified basis or——","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't see why not. Again, you're asking—I need to make sure I understand exactly what they're asking for.","Yes. Oh, you're not the press.","Counselor to the [INTERVIEWED] Dan Bartlett. I could ask a question. You showed some strong leadership today—[laughter].","[INTERVIEWER]. Why is it so important to you, sir, that you take on this issue as a political fight? Clearly, there's bipartisan——","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't view it as a political fight. So do you want to start your question over? I view it as a good policy.","[INTERVIEWER]. Why is it—clearly——","[INTERVIEWED]. Are you talking about the energy issue?","[INTERVIEWER]. No, I'm sorry, the ports issue.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's not a political issue.","[INTERVIEWER]. But there clearly are members of your own party who will go to the mat against you on this.","[INTERVIEWED]. It's not a political issue.","[INTERVIEWER]. Why are you—to make this, to have this fight?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't view it as a fight. I view it as me saying to people what I think is right, the right policy.","[INTERVIEWER]. What's the larger message that you're conveying by sticking to this UAE contract, by saying that you're not going to budge on this or you don't want to change policy?","[INTERVIEWED]. There is a process in place where we analyze—where the Government analyzes many, many business transactions to make sure they meet national security concerns. And I'm sure if you—careful review, this process yielded a result that said, yes, a deal should go forward.","One of my concerns, however, is mixed messages. And the message is, \"It's okay for a British company, but a Middle Eastern company—maybe we ought not to deal the same way.\" It's a mixed message. You put interesting words in your question, but I just view—my job is to do what I think is right for the country. I don't intend to have a fight. If there's a fight, there is one but—nor do I view this as a political issue.","[INTERVIEWER]. I say it because you said you'd be willing to use the veto on it.","[INTERVIEWED]. I would. That's one of the tools the [INTERVIEWED] has to indicate to the legislative branch his intentions. A veto doesn't mean fight or politics; it's just one of the tools I've got. I say veto, by the way, quite frequently in messages to Congress.","Palestinian Government/Hamas","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], Israel is halting payments to the Palestinians—the tax monies. What do you think about that, and what is the next step?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'll just give you our Government's position, and that is, we have said that—well, first of all, the U.S. Government doesn't give direct grants to Palestine. We go through the Palestinian Authority. We go through—we give grants through NGOs from our USAID to help people. But my statement still stands, that so long as Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist, my view is, we don't have a partner in peace and, therefore, shouldn't fund a government that is not a partner in peace. I thought the elections were important. I was one voice that said the elections should go forward on time.","But I recognized that, one, elections are the first step in many cases in evolution of a true democracy; and secondly, that elections show—give everybody a true look at how—what people are thinking on the street; and thirdly, though, that because the Palestinians spoke, doesn't necessarily mean we have to agree with the nature of—the party elected. And the party elected has said, \"We're for the destruction of Israel.\" And our policy is, two states living side by side in peace. And therefore, it's hard to have a state living side by side in peace when your stated objective is the destruction of one of the states. So my policy still stands, what I said day one after the Hamas elections.","Medicare Reform","[INTERVIEWER]. Can I ask you about a domestic issue, the prescription drug benefit plan? A lot of Democrats are on recess, and they want to make a big campaign issue out of this this year. What makes you think that the problems that this program being rolled out has had are something other than just the glitches that you've described?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm glad that they're making this an issue. This is—the reforms that we passed in the Medicare law were necessary and are going to change people's lives in a positive way. And I look forward to talking about this issue next fall, if that's one of the issues they want to talk about, because I understand the impact that this law is going to have on seniors. And millions have signed up, and millions are realizing the benefit of this program. And so it's—we have done the right thing in passing this law. Seniors are given different options. Seniors are going to get an extraordinarily good drug benefit. We have helped modernize Medicare. And looking forward to talking about it.","Good."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone1","text":["Pope John Paul II's Funeral","[INTERVIEWED]. Listen, were you there in person?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED]. One, I'm really glad I came. There was never any question I would come. Last night we hosted a reception at the Embassy for many of the leaders of the Catholic Church at home, and they were very grateful that I came and Laura came and Dad came and [INTERVIEWED] Clinton came and Condi came as well as others. And I told them, to a person, that it's such an honor to represent our country at a ceremony honoring a truly great man who is and will always be a great historical figure.","I knew the ceremony today would be majestic, but I didn't realize how moved I would be by the service, itself, by the beautiful music. I was struck—as an aside—struck by the fact that the sound was so clear in this huge facility. It was as if we were inside the cathedral listening, and the voices were so pure. I thought the homily was really good. We were given an English version, fortunately—if you haven't read it, maybe you've seen it? Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautifully done.","I was struck by the response of the crowd. And I think it's interesting to note the moments where the crowd responded. One in particular is when His Eminence spoke to His Holiness's relationship to the young of the world, and there was a great outpouring of enthusiasm for that line. And then I think the thing that struck all our delegation most intensely was the final scene of the plain-looking casket—one of three, by the way, lead, wood, and wood— being carried and held up for the seal to be seen, and then the sun pouring out. This will be one of the highlights of my Presidency, to have been at this great ceremony.","So off we go to home now.","Pope John Paul II's Legacy","[INTERVIEWER]. Your predecessor suggested that the Pope would leave a mixed legacy, even though he was a great man. Since you differed with him on the war to such a great degree, do you also think it will be a mixed legacy?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think Pope John Paul II will have a clear legacy of peace, compassion, and a strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone.","Upcoming Meeting With Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon","[INTERVIEWER]. You're going to see Prime Minister Sharon soon. There's been some talk in Israel that maybe you're not going to raise this issue of this latest settlement expansion. Are you going to do that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I've raised the issue of settlement expansions publicly. I mean, it was upon the prompting of your question. You bet. What I say publicly, I say privately. And that is, the roadmap has clear obligations on settlements and that we expect the Prime Minister to adhere to those roadmap obligations. And the roadmap has got obligations for the Palestinians. We have a great opportunity—\"we,\" the world, has a great opportunity to help a democracy grow—begin and grow, starting in the Gaza.","The Prime Minister of Israel has decided to pull out of Gaza. As you know, I applauded that decision at the White House, with him standing by my side. And I think now is the time to focus the world's attention on what is possible. And we've already started that process of realizing the possible by having General Ward work with the Palestinians to streamline and coordinate Palestinian security forces so that, upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, there is a security presence that will protect people.","We've got to do more. We've got to make sure that an economy can flourish there.","[INTERVIEWER]. So you're going to try to talk him out of this latest settlement expansion he's talking about?","[INTERVIEWED]. My position is clear, and I will—I stated, obviously, now the second time in a brief period of time, and I will say so privately as well.","I think you need to know what the successful strategy will be. And that is there is more than just security in Gaza. We need to have institution-building, and there needs to be an international effort that encourages and fosters economic vitality so that a government which does emerge in Gaza will be able to better speak to the hopes of those who live in the Gaza. And success in the Gaza will make success on the West Bank easier. And so one of our— I will be talking to the Prime Minister about the need to work with the Palestinian Government, [INTERVIEWED] Abbas, to facilitate success, to enhance success.","Let me make sure I go back to the first answer on His Holiness. I said—I think my answer was, is that—what did I say?","Pope John Paul II's Legacy","[INTERVIEWER]. I asked if you thought it was a mixed message, and you said, \"I think John Paul II will have a clear legacy of peace.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. A clear and excellent legacy, if you don't mind adding the word \"excellent.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. Clear and excellent.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. In other words, a strong legacy. I wanted to make sure there was a proper adjective to the legacy I thought he left behind. It was more than just \"clear.\"","Press Secretary Scott McClellan. You said \"strong,\" too, in that answer.","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes, you said \"strong legacy of setting a clear moral tone.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Fine. Okay, good.","Democracy in the Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. Getting back to the Middle East for a moment, there have been hopeful signs in the region lately. But some in the region think that some of our allies there, particularly Saudi Arabia and Egypt, still are not doing enough to help foster democracy in their own countries. Do you think they're doing enough, or are you encouraging them to——","[INTERVIEWED]. We will continue to encourage democracy. But I also have said many times that it is important for those of us who live in a democratic society to remember two things: One, our own road to democracy was a little bumpy; we have a Constitution and a Declaration of Independence but, nevertheless, had slavery for a long period of time, for example. And secondly, that we shouldn't expect others to adapt that which we think—we shouldn't try to impose our democracy on other nations. What we should say is, \"We'll work with you to develop a democracy which adapts to your own cultures and your own religions and your own habits.\"","I'm fully aware that there is work to be done. But I think it's also our job to encourage those nations and, at the same time, recognize that all nations are not starting at the same spot in order to achieve democracy. I mean, Iraq, it's very important for us in Iraq to recognize that we—we transferred sovereignty 10 months ago. Remember we all traveled to NATO— to the NATO summit? And it may seem like an eternity to you all—[laughter]—but 10 months in the greater scheme of things is a short period of time. And nevertheless, during that short period of time, the Iraqis have voted, and today they've announced their Prime Minister. The Government will be up and running, the Government Assembly there, to write a constitution. In other words, things are happening quite rapidly, which is positive.","But nevertheless, there is a certain— there's got to be a certain realism about how fast things can possibly happen, given where different nations have started from.","Now, I will continue to press forward on encouraging democracy and reform in every nation, because I believe that is the ultimate strategy to defeat the terrorists. In the short run, we'll continue to find them and work with nations to find them and share intelligence to find them, bring them to justice. In the long term, the spread of freedom and democracy—democracies reflecting the nature of the people and the history of those countries will mean that generations will more likely grow up in peace.","Pope John Paul II's Funeral","[INTERVIEWER]. When you sat there surrounded by that incredibly—array of world leaders and looked forward to the kind of spread of democracy you're talking about, is there something about just that assemblage there? Who did you talk to? Who did you see? And did it strike you that this was a remarkable ability to pull together such disparate people?","[INTERVIEWED]. I was most attentive to the ceremony, itself, and was amazed by the size of the crowd. We came walking out of the grand stairway, and it was a very inspiring sight.","[INTERVIEWER]. And the flags.","[INTERVIEWED]. And the flags and the statues and just—yes, the bishops and the archbishops and different leaders of the churches right across the way from me. Of course, the cardinals—you know, a handful of whom I know, have gotten to know quite well and admire greatly, by the way. So that was pretty well my focus there.","When I first got there—when Laura and I first got there, we shook hands with the folks around us. Obviously, Jacques and Madam Chirac were right next door; I spent some time visiting with them. But everybody there was—there wasn't much chitchat. There was intense focus on the ceremony.","[INTERVIEWER]. But what it represented, to have that many people——","[INTERVIEWED]. No, I understand. I believe that is part of the power of Pope John Paul II. And he was such a believer in freedom. I saw Lech Walesa, for example. I was struck by the number of Polish flags that were in the crowd.","You know what was really interesting? There were some signs urging that His Holiness be made a saint.","[INTERVIEWER]. Now!","[INTERVIEWED]. \"Now,\" yes—\"subito.\" You know, I really didn't reflect that much on the politics of the moment during the ceremony. I was more—I thought a lot about Pope John Paul II. I mean, here's a person who has shown that a single individual can make a big difference in history and that, in my judgment, he received his great power and strength from the Almighty.","[INTERVIEWER]. Just to follow up on that, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], a couple questions about the Pope. One, I noticed at one point you had your glasses on, and you were following along— I'm not sure if you were looking at the homily at that point or maybe, did you have one of those guides that——","[INTERVIEWED]. I did. It's hard to follow— my Spanish is not very good—[laughter]— nevertheless, it is decent enough to pick up sounds that then can help me follow the Italian.","[INTERVIEWER]. Had you ever been to a Latin mass before? I imagine you've been to an English mass.","[INTERVIEWED]. No, never been to a Latin mass.","[INTERVIEWER]. The other question was, we never had a chance to—you talked about a lot about what struck you from this ceremony. We never got a chance to talk to you about, by contrast, how you were struck by the wake, if you will, when you went through the other night. How do the two ceremonies—you know, different kinds of emotions in the two?","[INTERVIEWED]. I felt—I mean, obviously, we were surrounded by a crowd at the wake, but I felt—when I was kneeling there, I felt—I'm trying to think of the right word—\"alone\" isn't the right word, because I was aware of people, but felt much more in touch with a spirit. I really did. I was very much—felt at peace there and was prayerful. And at the other ceremony, it was probably just because of all the sights and sounds and majesty and colors that, you know, I felt more like a spectator than a participant, but more of a spectator.","[INTERVIEWER]. You knew him personally, I mean, to kneel there and see his body after you've met with him so many times and had— I mean, that must have been quite powerful and——","[INTERVIEWED]. My relationship with Pope John Paul II was a very good relationship. He was such a gentle man, and at the end of his life he made his points to me with his eyes. The last visit, as you know, he was pretty physically—he was struggling, and yet his eyes twinkled, just real clear. Much of the communications was done by paperwork, which——","[INTERVIEWER]. Did he speak English?","[INTERVIEWED]. Some, but it was hard to really understand him because he was struggling. That's why it's really interesting for people to note that there was a lot of testimony—and in my remarks, I tried to witness that as well—that his struggle at the end of his life and the dignity with which he struggled was a clear example of Christ's influence in his life.","I was honored to see that firsthand. He's one of the great vigorous leaders—mountain climber, educator, instructor—who then had to struggle using the very tools that enabled him to be a vigorous teacher, outdoorsman, freedom fighter, and yet, nevertheless, he still could communicate clearly through eyes which were, you know, crystal clear. And I remember the Castel Gandolfo, when Laura and I went to visit him. And he took us out on the balcony. The Castel overlooks this fantastic lake; it's a spectacular lake. And he was much more conversant then. I think it might have been my first trip?","[INTERVIEWER]. It was 2001.","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes. Right before or after Genoa, the G-8 in Genoa. And he had a sparkle; he really wanted to show us this beautiful setting. I would define Pope John Paul II as a clear thinker who was like a rock. And tides of moral relativism kind of washed around him, but he stood strong as a rock. And that's why millions—one of the reasons why millions came to admire and love him.","I was asked by some of the leadership of the Church, was I surprised at the turnout? I said, \"Not at all, because millions from all religions, millions of Catholics and millions of others admired his strength and his purpose and his moral clarity.\"","[INTERVIEWER]. How did the Pope struggle with his health at the end of his life and his example throughout his life strengthen your own faith?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you know, it is as— clear example of Christ's influence in a person's life that he maintained such a kind of hopeful, optimistic, clear point of view amidst struggles—in his case, physical struggles. And that's—a lot of Christians gain great strength and confidence from seeing His Holiness in the last stages of life.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think that will help you in the months and years ahead, in your own life?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think all of us get touched in different ways if you're on a faith journey—we're all affected differently. But yes, I think my relationship with—and Pope John Paul II's example will serve—will be a moment in my life that will strengthen my faith and my belief— not just me, more significantly, millions of people whose life he touched. I think we might have witnessed—I don't know—perhaps the largest funeral in the history of mankind. I'm not sure if that's true or not; somebody said that might be true.","But there's a reason why the largest crowd ever to come and pay homage to a human happened, and it's because of the man's character, his views, his positions, his leadership capacity, his ability to relate to all people, his deep compassion, his love of peace. There's a reason why. Again, I repeat, I was honored to be one of many there, and I know you all were as well.","Besides the pomp and the majesty and the colors, there was a spirit that was an integral part of the ceremony. For me, the spirit was also at the wake, but more personal at the wake. That was a personal moment.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Faith","[INTERVIEWER]. If there was ever a moment where you ever had any doubts in your own faith, what out of the past public things would strengthen your resolve and firm up your relationship with your God?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think a walk in faith constantly confronts doubt, as faith becomes more mature. And you constantly confront, you know, questions. My faith is strong. The Bible talks about, you've got to constantly stay in touch with the Word of God in order to help you on the walk. But the Lord works in mysterious ways, and during all our life's journeys, we're enabled to see the Lord at work if our eyes are open and our hearts are open. And today—you can analyze, and you can look at the coffin being held, with the sun shining on it, anyway you want. I happen to feel it was a special moment that was part of a special ceremony for a special person. And it helped strengthen my faith. And you can have your faith strengthened on— you can have your faith strengthened when you stand up at a faith-based initiative and see someone standing up and testify to what their love has done to help a child or how a child's life has been helped.","My faith gets strengthened when I went to the school the other day and saw the mentoring relationship between a young professional woman and a young kid who's going to go to the SEED School where there's a 95-percent chance that kid is going to go to college. And that helps strengthen my faith. So there's, you know, ways—whether the moment be majestical or whether the moment be a part of just an average—your average moment in life, you can find ways to strengthen your faith. And it's necessary to do so, in my judgment. There is a—it's called a \"walk.\" It's not called a \"moment\" or a \"respite\"; it's a \"walk.\" It's a constant maturing of an understanding of a—and today's ceremony, I bet you, for millions of people was a reaffirmation for many and a way to make sure doubts don't seep into your soul.","Pope John Paul II's Successor","[INTERVIEWER]. Given that, how difficult do you think that it will be finding a successor to fill his shoes?","[INTERVIEWED]. Look, I'm interested in working with whoever the successor is. And I think that, as Cardinal McCarrick said at the ceremony on Saturday, the day His Holiness died, asked for prayers as he began his journey as one of the electors, as a Cardinal. You know, I'm not going to prejudge the selection process.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are there any qualities that you're specifically looking for?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm not a part of the selection process. I will be a [INTERVIEWED] representing a great nation in dealing with a great institution with which we have diplomatic relations.","[INTERVIEWER]. It's got to be a tough act to follow, though.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Meeting With Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi","[INTERVIEWER]. Can you tell us a little bit about your dinner with Prime Minister Berlusconi? Did you talk, particularly, on Iraq? Did the subject come up, in terms of the intelligence officer who was killed by Americans?","[INTERVIEWED]. Yes, it did come up, and I expressed my regret once again and assured him that the investigation would be conducted in an aboveboard, transparent way.","[INTERVIEWER]. Did he say it had been a problem for him in keeping the support that there is in Italy for having troops in Iraq?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, he reaffirmed his commitment to—which he has given in the past—that we've got to make sure we complete the mission, that we help Iraqis to fight off the few. He knows what I know, that the sooner that gets done, the sooner our troops will be able to come home.","But he's also aware that what we don't want to do is leave prematurely, so that we don't complete our job. And the new Government is just about to be stood up; we look forward to working with the new Government on a lot of things and a lot of fronts. But on the security front, it's to make sure we're in sync with our training schedules, make sure that the chain of command within the military and between the civilian government and the military are strong and capable and will endure.","We've been waiting for this new Government so that we can then strategize. And as soon as the Government is sworn in, the appropriate folks, we can get Zal confirmed quickly, get him out there—of course, we have a good, strong Deputy Chief of Mission there now, upon swearing in—of course, I will be in contact with the Prime Minister. I've already spoke to [INTERVIEWED]. And General Casey, as well as the Charge—I mean, the Deputy Chief of Mission will be in touch with; Condi will be touch with her counterpart; Secretary Rumsfeld will be in touch with his counterpart as we strategize as to how to move forward.","As we strategize on tactics, on how to implement the strategy—which is clear— which is, we want to train you and make you as efficient as possible as quickly as possible, so that all of us can begin to, you know, as I say, bring our troops home with the honor they've earned.","[INTERVIEWER]. Italy is going to pull out 3,000 troops, I think, by the fall. Will you be able to absorb that?","[INTERVIEWED]. I don't know why you say that. I'm not sure why you said what you just said.","[INTERVIEWER]. I thought that was the number of troops Italy had in Iraq, and I——","[INTERVIEWED]. They've got 3,300 now, and you said they're going to pull 3,000 out by the fall?","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, I guess—I don't——","[INTERVIEWED]. Okay. What I did hear was, is that the Prime Minister wants to work to make sure we complete the mission. But I'm not sure where that came from.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think he'll leave troops in if, in fact, enough haven't been trained?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we'll work to complete the training mission of the Iraqis. And it's important we do it and get it right. The amazing thing is, is that if you really think about what's happened in the 10-month period, in spite of some very difficult days and in spite of some tragedy, loss of life, this country is—there is a democracy emerging in this country. And it was really kicked off by the huge vote of over 8 million people.","But no, we'll work with all our coalition, continue to make sure we stay in touch with all our—I had breakfast with Tony Blair this morning, speaking about coalition. You know, I stay in regular contact with the Prime Minister.","Representative Tom DeLay","[INTERVIEWER]. Can I ask you about Tom DeLay, the statement he made in the wake of the Schiavo case, that judges were out of control and should be held accountable. What did you think about those?","[INTERVIEWED]. I believe in an independent judiciary. I believe in proper checks and balances. And we'll continue to put judges on the bench who strictly and faithfully interpret the Constitution.","Foreign and Domestic Priorities/Social Security Reform","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], I know you're not— you've said—you've often said you're not consumed by polls, but a fair amount has been written lately about your approval ratings, which in some polls are at sort of a low point. Some polls——","[INTERVIEWED]. Some of them were going up the other day.","[INTERVIEWER]. Okay. Well, some say that——","[INTERVIEWED]. You can find them going up, and you can find them going down. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. In general, what——","[INTERVIEWED]. You can pretty much find out what you want in polls, is my point. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWER]. What about the theory that your Presidency is moving from one dominated by foreign policy to one of domestic policy? Ironically, now that some of things are settling down in Iraq and Afghanistan and you're facing tough issues like Social Security, it's a little tougher road to hoe. What are your thoughts?","[INTERVIEWED]. My thoughts are the [INTERVIEWED] has always got to balance foreign policy and domestic policy, and I will— I did so in the first term. As you might remember, we were confronted with a recession, and I felt we needed to reform schools, and at the same time, I had to fight the war on terror. We're continuing to fight the war on terror. The war on terror goes on, and that's the important thing for me to continue to remind our fellow citizens. By the way, we will work to defeat the enemy by, you know, making sure our troops are well framed up, prepared, ready to move quickly. It's part of the transformation process that the Secretary is leading. And to make sure our intelligence services mesh and work closely together, I'm looking forward to getting John Negroponte confirmed as quickly as possible, so we can deal with this crucial aspect.","But there's also, obviously, a domestic component. There was a domestic component in the first term. There is a domestic component in the second term. I might remind you that at points during the tax debate, I can remember people had declared that tax relief was dead on arrival. Occasionally, somebody would say something that was not very positive about the process, and people would all of a sudden assume that nothing was going to get done. So I'm accustomed to, you know, the process of getting a piece of legislation out. And I'm very optimistic that when it's all said and done, the legislators will understand that the American people recognize there's a problem in Social Security and expect something to be done. And I look forward to being a part of that.","I had laid out a timetable to make it clear to the American people my views about the problems inherent in Social Security. And I think we're making progress. I think slowly but surely, the American people are coming to realize there is a serious problem with Social Security—not if you've retired. And that's the other aspect of making sure we succeed in the Social Security debate, is to make sure seniors know they're going to get their checks. And we've got work to do on that.","[INTERVIEWER]. Still think it will pass this year?","[INTERVIEWED]. I certainly hope so, because now is the time to fix the problem. Every year we wait costs billions of dollars more. And I fully realize some people would rather me not be discussing this issue. The job of the [INTERVIEWED] is to set an agenda that deals with problems. And sometimes—sometimes the legislature doesn't want to deal with the problem.","But I'm going to continue to remind all of us in Government that when we see a problem, we have an obligation to do something about it, no matter what some may think are the short-term political consequences. I happen to believe that not dealing with the problem will create political consequences when the public realizes how serious the problem is. If you don't deal with the problem or you go home and say, \"I'm not dealing with the problem,\" there will be a political consequence.","I've learned that lesson, as a Governor and [INTERVIEWED], that the people expect and respect people for setting agenda items and staying focused on achieving a solution to the problem. And I've set an agenda. I set an agenda on energy. We need an energy bill. You know, we've been talking about energy for 4 years. Now, I fully realize an energy bill reflects a longer-term strategy. But we need to—we need to do a lot of things.","Eventually what we're going to have to do is change our habits, change the types of automobiles we drive. I believe we will have a zero-emission coal-fired electricity plant. I saw the—when we went to Cleveland—or Columbus, we saw the technology involved with that. But Congress needs to get me an energy bill. And it seems like to me, with the price of gasoline where it is, that ought to be enough this time to cause people to get moving on the bill. But I'll continue to push it.","We need to get a budget. We passed— I put a pretty good budget, a real good budget. It helps cut the budget in half— the deficit in half over a 5-year period of time. Now they need to get their differences worked out and get it to my desk. I'll be a part of that process as well.","And then, eventually, we're going to have this tax relief commission come forward. In other words, I have an obligation to set agenda items. And when I set one, I will continue to work it and remind people that we have a duty to deal with these problems.","I like the debate, by the way, as an aside. I'm enjoying this. I'm enjoying——","[INTERVIEWER]. Even if a lot of——","[INTERVIEWED]. ——because I feel I got elected for a reason. My nature is such that, if I came to Washington and saw a problem and didn't deal with it, I wouldn't feel very good about myself. I want it to be said that George W. Bush got elected and did what he said he was going to do, for starters.","You covered my campaigns. Every speech, I talked about Social Security. And I started talking about Social Security in the year 2000, because I recognized a problem coming down the road. And it is a serious problem, particularly if you're a younger American. You have no problem if you're receiving a Social Security check. I do not care—and I'm going to say it like you've heard me say it—it doesn't matter what the propagandists say, people are going to get their checks. You might remember the ads that they ran against me when I was running for office that said, \"If George W. gets elected, you're not going to get your check.\" I'm sure you guys analyzed those and realized that upon election, people got their checks, which might say something about those who ran the ads, right? Well, they're saying it again. They're trying to frighten seniors in order to stop people from coming together.","Now, in 2001, something that has lost a little bit of the focus of those covering this issue, I called together the Moynihan Commission, and I think it might be wise for people who analyze this issue to refresh their memory about the Moynihan Commission, because the Moynihan Commission, made up of equally Democrats and Republicans, came up with some interesting ideas to solve this problem.","[INTERVIEWER]. How deeply have you had to draw down on that political credit that you felt you had?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think you get—I think you earn capital, you know? I think——","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you spending any?","[INTERVIEWED]. I'm spending a lot—every time I go out. [Laughter] But you earn capital by spending capital; that's what the people expect. We've got trips—I'll be keeping—going out, reminding people that there is a problem.","And one of these days, we'll be able to look back and say, \"You know, we were successful convincing the American people there was a problem, and we were successful reminding seniors that you're not going to have your check taken away from you.\" And then all of a sudden, it becomes a true generational issue, because the grandparents receiving the checks, they're going to start asking, \"Now that I'm secure, what are you going to do for my grandkid,\" because the grandchildren are going to pay an enormous price. You heard those experts sit up there and say that if nothing happens it is likely younger workers are going to have to pay an 18-percent payroll tax.","Now, I was born prior to 1950. But if I were my daughter hearing somebody predict that at some point in time she's paying an 18-percent payroll tax, I'd be suggesting to the old man—me—that I get something done. And that's what we're doing. We're working hard to get it done.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you surprised that it's taken this much work, this long——","[INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. ——to make progress on this, because, you know——","[INTERVIEWED]. No. And this is a difficult issue. I've heard Members say—I'm not going to tell you who they are nor what party they're from; I wish you hadn't have brought this up. We hear the talk out of Capitol Hill saying, \"Oh, darn, I wish the [INTERVIEWED] had just focused only on the budget or maybe the energy bill.\" There are a lot of people who would rather not talk about this issue. I understand that. Again, I don't think that's part of my job description, avoid issues because it may be politically difficult. I think my job description is, if you see a problem, talk about it and work with members of both political parties to come up with a solution.","And there's beginning to be some talk on Capitol Hill. But I'm not the least bit surprised, because it is a tough issue for Members, for people who've got, you know, a relatively short-term horizon, 2-year horizon. They're worried about—some of them are worried about elections. Some of them in both the House and the Senate—from both parties, by the way—are thinking longer term. And they're beginning to talk some ideas, and that's constructive.","You know, I remember I was telling [INTERVIEWED] Clinton, I remember watching one of his townhall meetings in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on this very subject. And I thought it was a very impressive presentation. By the way, a lot of the language happens to be pretty close to some of the townhall meetings we've had.","But, no, I'm not surprised people want to avoid this issue.","Travel With Former [INTERVIEWED]s Bush and Clinton","[INTERVIEWER]. What has it been like spending time with the former [INTERVIEWED]s for 3 days? That's the longest time——","[INTERVIEWED]. It's fun. Oh, it's great. You know, we share war stories, you know, a lot of talking, a lot of interesting experiences about different world leaders that we may all have met—or all three of us met, just different experiences that, you know, my dad might have had or [INTERVIEWED] Clinton might have had.","There is a lot of interest, obviously, with former [INTERVIEWED]s about, you know, policy, so I had them sit in on our policy briefings this morning with Condi and Steve and the CIA fellow traveling with us—not this morning, yesterday and the day before, on Air Force One. And then yesterday at the Embassy, I wanted to include them in. And you know, we had a—these CIA briefings a lot of time prompt policy discussions, you know, how is this process going. Steve and Condi, now that she's here—both of them were able to bring Dad and [INTERVIEWED] Clinton up to date on our strategy in dealing with a particular issue. It's interesting to get their points of view about their experiences in particular countries. It was fun. It was really a lot of fun. I was honored they came.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you worried about them spending so much time together, those two? [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, you heard my gridiron speech. [Laughter]","Listen, thank you all. Hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. Absolutely fascinating.","By the way, I think when you discuss religion—on doubt, there is no doubt in my mind there is a living God and no doubt in my mind that the Lord, Christ, was sent by the Almighty. No doubt in my mind about that. When I'm talking about doubts, I'm talking about the doubts that an individual struggles with in his or her life. That's important for you to make sure you get that part of the dialog correct, if you don't mind.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWED]. Got it? Everybody got it correct? All right.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you.","Weekend Plans","[INTERVIEWER]. What are your plans this weekend?","[INTERVIEWED]. Like Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News], I'm on the injured reserve list from running, so I'll be mountain biking. I think Cat McKinnon is going come up from Austin. Oh, yes. And I'll be fishing. I'll be finishing my book, \"Peter the Great,\" by Robert K. Massie. Some of you old-timers have probably already read it. I'm just now—have you read it?","[INTERVIEWER]. Getting ready for the next Russia trip.","[INTERVIEWED]. Have you read it?","[INTERVIEWER]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. I like when you said \"old-timer,\" and you looked at Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters]. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. He probably had read it, and I wasn't going to look at Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News], of course, I'm too polite. [Laughter]","We'll have briefings. Condi is coming to spend the night; Hadley will be spending a night there. We'll start briefing the Sharon visit Sunday night. And then we'll obviously greet the Prime Minister and then head off to Fort Hood on Tuesday morning and work on that speech probably Monday evening.","Looking forward to getting back down there again. I may do a little cedar work— depends on how sleepy the crew is.","[INTERVIEWER]. I'll be fishing, just down the Bosque River.","[INTERVIEWED]. Really?","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes. I'm sleeping at the Side Oats Ranch tonight.","[INTERVIEWED]. Tell them hi. Middle Fork has got some water in it.","[INTERVIEWER]. They do.","[INTERVIEWED]. The Middle Fork comes down to my place.","[INTERVIEWER]. Does it come down to you from his, or goes the other way?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think it comes down, doesn't it? Yes, I think he's west of me, so it's coming down toward Waco. The Middle Fork feeds into the Brazos.","Consider yourself lucky you get to go down to Texas.","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm delighted.","[INTERVIEWED]. You're not grousing about it, are you?","[INTERVIEWER]. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry I missed Easter. I was at home for that.","[INTERVIEWED]. It may be—I hope—I haven't heard, but it may be that the wildflowers, are they out yet? They say there is going to be a spectacular bluebonnet season this year; I mean spectacular.","2005 NCAA Women's Basketball Champions Baylor Lady Bears","[INTERVIEWER]. Is that in honor of the Baylor women's basketball team?","[INTERVIEWED]. I called, as a matter of fact, on the airplane flying to Rome, I called the coach, Kim Mulkey-Robertson, a fine person. I had met her before when she brought—you all saw her, at least if you were on the pool, right? Let's see— anyway, she was with the Midway girls softball team when they came out, the national champs softball team. Her daughter is a player on it, and so she came out with the parents. But she was one excited lady. And she did a heck of a job.","[INTERVIEWER]. Blew them out.","[INTERVIEWED]. They've got a great team. I'm looking forward to welcoming them to the White House."," "]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersaboardairforceone2","text":["White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. So I thought the [INTERVIEWED] and Mrs. Bush would spend a little bit of time with you, with their reflections, on the record. We don't have a lot of time, especially because Ben Feller [Associated Press] is not feeling well.","[INTERVIEWED] I would say this is one of the most exciting trips of my Presidency. Exciting because when we first got to Washington, Africa was—parts of Africa were in turmoil; not much had been to arrest disease; there wasn't intense world focus on the continent. The second trip to Africa for me—the fifth for Laura—was a chance to herald courageous people in their efforts to deal with hopelessness. And what really made me happy was that the people of Africa have come to appreciate the generosity of the American people.","I had a couple of goals. One was to encourage people to continue to make difficult choices—democracy is hard work— but also assure them that we'd stay with them if they made the right choices.","Secondly, I wanted to highlight for the American people what the—that great compassionate work is being done. And I'll give you some—Laura can share some anecdotes too. You know, in the hospital in Tanzania, to see a 3-year-old baby survive a mosquito bite when years earlier probably wouldn't have was a very compelling moment for me.","To have the little orphans in Rwanda put on such a cheerless—a cheery face because somebody is trying to provide them love was inspiring to me. To watch their little guys play tee-ball—all of whom were orphans—against the little school and see how inspired they were. But also see the concern and care of their mentors and coaches was very inspiring to me.","All of these programs are supported by the American taxpayer, and all of them matter. To hear the testimony of these kids and teachers in Liberia about how our aid has helped them regain confidence—I don't know if you all were in there when the mother of three talked about—her husband left her, she said, because she was illiterate, so he just left her with the three kids. And she's a part of this adult literacy program that USAID is helping with. She talked about being able to read, fill out bank checks, her deposit slips, then announced she wanted to go to college, and then announced she wanted to take Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's job.","Anyway, it's the human condition that matters. You heard me say a lot on the trip that we're on a mission of mercy, and that's what I think we are. And I think it's in our national interest to do it. I know this: I know that when you volunteer as an individual to help somebody who hurts, it helps you. Well, I believe the same when it comes to collective hearts of America. So it's been a—it's an exciting trip. I mean, you saw the crowds, you saw the enthusiasm.","But that's not what's important. You know, people say—Bob Geldof asked me, he said: \"Why don't you take credit for it? Why don't you show what you have done for Africa?\" Well, it's not me, for starters. And you don't act out of the desire to enhance your own standing; that's not exactly why one is called into service. It doesn't matter about me. What matters is, are we saving people's lives? That's what matters. And we are.","And so I'm really pleased with it and had great meetings with the leaders. It seems like a couple of months ago that we went to Benin. But he's a good guy. He's enthusiastic. And of course, Kikwete in Tanzania and Kagame in—look, the other thing about the Rwanda stop and the Liberia stop is, these are societies that only recently have been ravished by unbelievable and unspeakable violence. And yet they're getting back on their feet. And it's hard work, and we'll help them. That was what I told them. And these were five very strong leaders that we visited with.","Which leads me to conclude this—and Laura can share some thoughts—America should not be dictating to these countries, America ought to be helping leaders make decisions. And that's what we're doing. And we go to Africa with a belief in the capacity of human beings to meet high standards. That's what I kept trying to say to you out there in code. We didn't go guilt ridden. We go with a positive sense about the capacity of leaders to rise to the challenge and meet certain basic criteria, such as honest government, investing in children, investing in health, and understanding that marketplace economics and trade is more powerful than accepting relief from countries.","Anyway—and how about the Liberian troops? You talk about proud people. Wasn't it unbelievable? \"Yeah, Mr. [INTERVIEWED], it was.\"","Yes, Laura.","[At this point, the First Lady made brief remarks.]","[INTERVIEWED] Okay, we'll do a round-robin here. Yes, Ann [Ann Compton, ABC News], you're the senior person.","African View of the 2008 U.S. [INTERVIEWED]ial Election/Texas [INTERVIEWED]ial Primary","[INTERVIEWER]. One of the things that we heard from people—I guess they do consider the United States a democracy, a role model. What if an American—African American were elected [INTERVIEWED]? Did they talk to you——","[INTERVIEWED] That never came up.","[INTERVIEWER]. It never came up?","The First Lady. It never came up to us at all. They said they were very fascinated with the election, one group that I talked to.","[INTERVIEWED] I'd just like to remind you what Kikwete said. He said, \"I hope the next [INTERVIEWED] is as good as this one.\" Now, I'm not blowing my own horn——and I'm sure it was a screaming headline.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you going to vote in the Texas primary?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes, I am.","[INTERVIEWER]. As a Democrat or a Republican?","[INTERVIEWED] I think I'll be in the Republican primary this year.","No, but it never came up. It seemed like a good storyline at the time. Somebody must be putting something out there in the pool, and everybody starts chatting about it.","[INTERVIEWER]. People would mention it to us.","[INTERVIEWED] If you asked them, yes, \"What do you think about Obama?\" Yes, they mentioned it to you all right. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER]. I asked them—I went out on the street, and two of the four people I asked about—you know, I'd say, Obama——","[INTERVIEWED] What?","[INTERVIEWER]. McCain—they like—they volunteered, two of them——","[INTERVIEWED] Really?","The First Lady. What country?","[INTERVIEWER]. Dar es Salaam.","[INTERVIEWED] Look, my mind was not on U.S. politics on this trip; it's just not. It is on yours, not mine. I'm focused on conducting foreign policy. Look, I understand this is the way it's going to be. We'll be having roundtables, and you're going to be fascinated on the latest thing on politics, and I'm going to be fascinated on trying to lay the foundation for lasting foreign policy that will make a significant difference to the United States. I'm not going to be frustrated about it—except every time. No.","[INTERVIEWED]'s Legacy/U.S. Foreign Policy","[INTERVIEWER]. A question on that—is this how, in the end, you would like this effort—or this kind of effort, if this not specific one— this is what your Presidency is ultimately about?","[INTERVIEWED] We just have to let history be the judge. But we've been a very active—we've had a very active foreign policy, whether it be liberating people from tyranny in order to protect ourselves or liberating people from disease, we've been active and strong and bold. And we'll let history judge the results.","I would just tell you this, and you've heard me say it, and it's true: There's no such thing as short-term political history. I mean, short-term history of an administration—forget \"political\"—there is such thing as short-term political history because there's an end result, win or lose. There's no such thing as an accurate history of an administration until time has lapsed, unless you're doing little-bitty things.","[The First Lady made further remarks.]","[INTERVIEWED] The other thing about— one of the things I hope people, when they are able to take an objective look at an administration—which I'm not sure is possible, if you happen to have been living at the time of the administration; maybe you can, I don't think so—is whether or not an administration makes decisions based upon certain fundamental principles from which it will not vary. And you've heard me say over and over again, freedom is universal, or to whom much is given, much is required. Those are fundamental principles on which one can have a foreign policy.","And one of the great dangers for America is to become isolationist or protectionist. And the purpose of—on trips like this is to remind people of the need not to become isolationist. And so it's—I view this as—this was a trip that heralded results. But it was also a trip that gives us an opportunity to explain over and over again the foundations of the foreign policy of the Bush administration.","Yes, Feller. How you feeling, man? I've asked you twice. You look like you're a little pale.","Intelligence Reform Legislation","[INTERVIEWER]. I'm hanging in there.","[INTERVIEWED] Have you vomited yet today?","[INTERVIEWER]. That's off the record.","[INTERVIEWER]. No, that's on the record.","[INTERVIEWER]. I see a big microphone.","I'd like to ask you about an issue they're raising back home, and it's not the '08 campaign.","[INTERVIEWED] Okay.","[INTERVIEWER]. On FISA, I understand your position, but what I'm unclear about is whether you're doing something to break the deadlock. Do you see yourself engaging with the other side, compromising? Or where do we go from here?","[INTERVIEWED] How do you compromise on something like granting liability for a telecommunications company? You can't. If we do not give liability protection to those who are helping us, they won't help us. And if they don't help us, there will be no program. And if there's no program, America is more vulnerable.","What I'm going to do is continue to remind people that unless they get this program done, we're going to be vulnerable to attack.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you see an opportunity to work with the Democrats and——","[INTERVIEWED] I mean, there may be one, I don't know. But I will just tell you, there's no compromise on whether or not these phone companies get liability protection. See, what the American people must understand is that without help from the phone companies, there is no program. And these companies are going to be subject to multibillion dollar lawsuits by trial lawyers, plaintiffs' attorneys. And it's going to drive them away from helping us, unless they get liability protection, prospective and retroactive.","It's just so important for people to understand the dangers. If we don't have the capacity to listen to these terrorists, we're not going to be able to protect ourselves.","White House Press Secretary Perino. Just a reminder that they have the votes to pass it in the House.","[INTERVIEWED] They've got enough votes to pass the bill in the House. So yes, I'm going to talk about it a lot and keep reminding the American—I'm glad you asked the question, because this will give everybody a chance to know the dangers of the course that some in the House have put us on. And I'll keep talking about it.","You know what? The American people understand that we need to be listening to the enemy.","Situation in Kenya","[INTERVIEWER]. Back to Africa, on Kenya—on Kenya, I'm trying to understand——","[INTERVIEWED] Kenya?","[INTERVIEWER]. Kenya, yes.","[INTERVIEWED] That's why you've got the Secretary sitting here.","[INTERVIEWER]. Exactly. I mean, are you going to send her back? Where are we? What's next? And how realistic is it—I still don't understand how anyone is really thinking that the Government, which has been so stubborn, is actually going to——","[INTERVIEWED] ——the opposition.","[INTERVIEWER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWED] That's the dilemma; how you get two people to sit down at a table and work on what's best for Africa—I mean, for Kenya.","[INTERVIEWER]. But realistically, how do you? I mean, are you going to——","[INTERVIEWED] She was in the room with them.","[INTERVIEWER]. Are you going to go back?","[INTERVIEWED] We got Frazer, who's plenty competent.","[Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made brief remarks.]","[INTERVIEWED] I was going to say that, you know, the most effective way to get these issues resolved is for these leaders to feel pressure from their own people. And it's one thing for Kofi and Condi and people making phone calls, but Kenya is a society; it's got a—for example, Kenya is the economic engine for East Africa. I don't know if you saw all those ships in Dar es Salaam. Those were originally— many of them were originally headed for Nairobi, interestingly enough. And I suspect these leaders are beginning to feel a lot of pressure internal.","Secondly, they're actually hearing from African leaders about the dangers of allowing these kind of conflicts to not be nipped in the bud early, to be prevented from happening. And we will help. We sent people over, and we'll stay engaged. It's really up to the Kenyan society itself and the leaders there to get their leaders with them.","[INTERVIEWER]. Doesn't it seem to be that they're pressuring with violence?","[INTERVIEWED] With what?","[INTERVIEWER]. The way that they're pressuring, it seems to be with violence.","[INTERVIEWED] No, no, no, you're missing it. There is a civil society in Nairobi. You're talking about some of the splinter groups on some of the parties. There is a civil society, and it's a relatively sophisticated civil society that is exerting pressure, that is not resorting to violence.","Secretary Rice. The Kenyan press is very tough on these leaders to resolve this— [inaudible]—civil society—[inaudible]— people who are pressing for peaceful change and saying, you cannot let our society collapse into anarchy.","Return Trip From Africa","[INTERVIEWED] I get to ask a question. Will you be taking a nap on the way back?","[INTERVIEWER]. I didn't sleep one wink last night, but if I sleep on the flight home, I won't sleep when I get home, and I have to be at the office at 6:15 a.m.","[INTERVIEWED] You're going to go around the clock?","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, I might try.","[INTERVIEWED] I'm actually promoting— I've obviously got a nap on my mind. I was just trying to, like, plant the seed.","Yes, Rog [Roger Runningen, Bloomberg News].","U.S. View of the [INTERVIEWED]'s Visit to Africa","[INTERVIEWER]. I want to go back to Africa. You talked about Americans and their generosity——","[INTERVIEWED] What's that?","[INTERVIEWER]. Americans and their generosity—what do you think that Americans think of your trip?","[INTERVIEWED] I don't have any idea. What are you writing about it? I don't know what they think of it. Ask another question. I really don't know. I'm focused on the trip.","When I get home, I pick up a book and start reading it, and I'm sound asleep shortly thereafter. So I'm not—I don't know. I really don't know.","The First Lady. Depends on what you all are showing.","[INTERVIEWED] I don't know. I hope they think—here's what I hope they think: It's worthwhile to be supportive of a robust policy on the continent of Africa. It's worth our national security interest, and it's worth our interest to help people learn to read and write and save babies' lives from mosquito bites. That's what I hope they realize, and that's one of the main—that's a critical reason to go on the trip. I would hope that the country never says, well, it's not worth it over there, what happens over there—or it says, well, we've got to take care of our own first, exclusively.","And my answer is, we can do both. We're a generous country. And we do, do both.","U.S. Aid for Africa","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you have everything in place so that the next [INTERVIEWED], who might not look at Africa in the first 6 months—everything is in place to continue?","[INTERVIEWED] ——you know, getting this funding from PEPFAR. And I think we will. The PEPFAR program has been great. It's a bipartisan success. Congress funded the thing—not the \"thing,\" Congress funded the program, and they ought to take great pride in the success of PEPFAR. There's a process that goes on to get it reauthorized, and we'll try to get it funded, and will get it funded. I feel pretty good about getting it funded.","Same with the malaria initiative: It's making a huge difference, and the success is unbelievable. In Zanzibar, 20 percent of the kids were infected, had gotten malaria. Now it's one [percent], * in a pretty quick period of time.","Okay, guys."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithreportersdomesticandforeignpolicyissues","text":["Administration's Accomplishments in 1983","[INTERVIEWER]. Looking back over the past year, what do you think you did wrong, and what would you have done differently?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think there are always things that you'll think you did wrong. But I think, basically, we have continued on the path that we set in 1981. The progress that we've made economically is apparent. It is the first time in many years that we've had a recovery from a recession in which not only is industrial—well, let's say just productivity—increasing, personal earnings increasing, inflation and unemployment both going down—all of these things happening at the same time. This hasn't happened in a recovery for many, many years, which makes me believe we are on a firm footing and have laid a foundation for a solid recovery. That part is won.","There are things—if you say what should we have done differently?—well, there are things. In trying to negotiate bipartisan agreements on some of these, you look back and think, well, maybe if we'd worked harder in one direction or another we might have gotten more cooperation in our need to reduce government spending.","On the international scene, I think that our continued buildup of our strength has changed international relations a great deal. I don't think without that we would have had the beginning negotiations that we've had with regard to reduction of nuclear weapons, both the INF and the START talks. I think it is due to that.","I think we've got a finer relationship than we've had for a long time with our own friends and allies. This is particularly true in the efforts that we've made in Asia, as well as our longtime friends in Europe.","So, all in all, I think that there has been progress. But it is a foundation laid for more progress.","[INTERVIEWER]. If I could just—but surely—was there anything you went back at the end of the day and said, \"Oh, darn, I really\"—you know—\"that didn't work right, we should have done it.\" Is there any one thing that you can pick out?","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, well, I probably could get incensed about—but this was before 1983, earlier than that—going for the tax bill on the assumption that we'd been promised about $3 in reductions in spending for every dollar of tax revenue, and we have never seen the $3 in reduced spending.","The Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], do you think the new rapprochement between Arafat and Mubarak now opens the way as a breakthrough for the possibility of your peace plan getting moving and Hussein taking part?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, Helen, I'm always a little leery about saying a breakthrough, but I do think this: We are optimistic about this because if you look at the relationship there and the two countries—or the two peoples that were involved, Mubarak is the head of state of the one country in the Arab world that has gone forward and has a peace treaty with Israel. We're hopeful that the peace process will bring about more Arab nations making their peace with Israel.","Obviously, a part of that process depends on a fair and just settlement of the Palestinian question. And Arafat has, in the past, has been one who has refused to recognize Israel's right to exist as a nation. But the fact that earlier, and before this split in the PLO ranks, he had begun to discuss with King Hussein negotiations and participating in those negotiations on behalf of the Palestinians-then that broke down with the split in the Palestinian movement.","Now I think that what [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak is doing is talking to him about returning to where he was earlier, making contact with King Hussein, and getting those peace negotiations, our peace proposal, underway again.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think there's a good chance? [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, I do. I really do, because we had believed that a settlement in Lebanon had to precede going further with that. I don't think that's necessarily true now. I think enough progress has been made there that we can go forward with the peace movement.","[INTERVIEWER]. May I follow up, Mr. [INTERVIEWED]? Israel has denounced the talks between Arafat and [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak, saying it was a pure violation of the Camp David agreements. Would you respond to that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I don't think it was a violation. I can understand their feelings in view of the recent tragedy in Jerusalem, and the group taking credit for that claimed to be a PLO group and all. But at the same time, I think as they look at this a little more clearly, they will see that Mubarak, based on the experience of Egypt and its willingness to go forward for peace, is simply trying to persuade others to change their thinking.","There was one point not too long before the peace treaty with Egypt, in which Egypt was as violent in its hostility as perhaps today the elements of the PLO are. So, who is better able to try and bring in another person into the peace process than someone who has made the change that Egypt has made?","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think Mr. Arafat is still a popular leader among the Palestinians themselves?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, this is what we need to find out. I can't believe that that radical group that, under the influence of the Syrians, created all this tragedy around Tripoli and the innocent people that were killed because of the violence of that battle—I can't believe that the millions of Palestinians are going to choose that leadership.","The Soviet Union and Arms Negotiations","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], on a slightly different subject, you mentioned that due to our arms buildup, that brought the Soviets to the negotiating table. And now we've had a breakdown in the arms talks, and there seems to be an increased level of tension. Do you think we are at a confrontation state with the Soviets? [INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. And what do you see as the chance of an arms accord in 1984?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we're going to keep on with that. And, actually, the Soviets have not said no. They said they wouldn't set a date yet for the resumption of these talks.","[INTERVIEWER]. On INF they just walked out. [INTERVIEWED]. What?","[INTERVIEWER]. On the INF talks they just walked out. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, but since then there have been statements to the fact that they just are not ready and that they're unwilling at this point to set a date. I believe they will be back, and I believe we're further from a confrontation possibility because of the deterrent capability of the United States and our allies at this point. I think there was a far more unstable condition when we had let our own strength deteriorate to the point that there was a window of vulnerability.","And I would like to call your attention to one thing. There have been 19—prior to this, to our talks—there have been 19 efforts since World War II to engage the Soviet Union in talks about arms reduction. There has never been any progress made in those. The SALT talks, actually, were not arms reductions; they were supposed to be setting a ceiling on how many more weapons would be built. And that has not been ratified, the SALT II treaty.","But in these negotiations, even though the Soviets were not as forthcoming as we would like to have had them be, they still did make a couple of offers to reduce the number of their weapons. Now, that is the first time they have ever done that in any negotiations, in all these previous 19 attempts. And I think that now that they see that we are determined to maintain our own ability to defend ourselves, and our allies with us are included in that, I think that they have to see that these negotiations are in their interest as well as ours.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you have any signals that they are actually planning to come back? Or are you just looking at it from your—what you see as common sense?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. I think the things that we have heard. I think that this is, you might say, almost a part of the negotiating process. Their whole principal move over this last year or so has been an effort to stop the deployment of the intermediate-range weapons that were asked for by NATO. And the fact that we're going ahead, this, maybe, could be tied to that as still, you might say, an element of negotiating. But we are going to proceed with the installation of those weapons.","[INTERVIEWER]. And you don't think it's 3 minutes to 12, the doomsday clock? The scientists seem to think so. [INTERVIEWED]. Well.—","[INTERVIEWER]. And they think it's a more dangerous world now.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, maybe the scientists know more about science. And from the standpoint of the power of the weapons, yes, they are more powerful; they are more destructive on both sides than they were before. And maybe looking at it from a scientist's viewpoint, that moves up their doomsday clock. But they're not involved in the diplomatic and political end of this as we are.","[INTERVIEWER]. But, sir, you only have 3—really, 3 minutes now to make a decision on war and peace according to the nuclear scientists. There would be 3 minutes on each side.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, now, Helen, in the Bible weren't we told that a long period of time was only a moment or even a second to God? I don't know what their 3 minutes refers to. I know it doesn't refer to 3 minutes.-","[INTERVIEWER]. You think it would be a lot longer for you to decide?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm wondering. On their doomsday clock, each minute on that clock—is that weeks? Is that months? Is that years? They've never said what it is. But, no, I believe that actually—and I can understand their feeling—all that they hear and, forgive me, but a lot of the editorial content is that, \"Oh, there are great tensions.\" There has been, let's say, more heat in rhetoric. There has not been more heat in the actual relationship. At the time that the rhetoric was being used from both sides, our negotiators were sitting there at the table negotiating.","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], can I come back on the prospects of these talks, these arms talks? There's a lot of concern, especially in Europe, that with the lack of dialog between West and the East, especially as the U.S. is entering an election year—if you run for reelection—that the Soviets are not likely to help you. How do you see the prospects for some kind of an agreement before the elections?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I would hope that the Soviet Union would remember their failure in trying to influence the German election and decide not to go down that road again. But as far as I am concerned, whoever our candidate may be, I don't think any decisions on a subject of this kind should be made on our part, on our side, on the basis of—as I said the other night—political considerations.","We are going to continue to do everything we can to resume and achieve arms reductions, as sizable as we can make them, and ultimately I would hope total elimination of nuclear weapons. They have no real place in a civilized world. The goal is peace. And I've been a little disturbed by the tendency of so many in this country who seem to feel that somehow we're at fault, when they are the ones who left the table without setting a date for return.","[INTERVIEWER]. So, you're not going to make any proposal before—","[INTERVIEWED]. Oh, we're in communication. We haven't broken off communications. We're not, as we've been portrayed, that the two superpowers are here separated with no contact at all. No, we're in communication with them. And we want to continue these policies that would lead toward reduction of arms and that would lead toward peace.","I am prepared to say if the Soviet Government wants peace, there will be no war, because I know for a fact that no other country wants war with the Soviet Union. The ball is really in their court. If they want peace, they can have it.","[INTERVIEWER]. And isn't that, though, what's kept the peace, this mutual terror?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think the deterrent capability, yes. See, we have a weapon here in the world today, the nuclear weapon, that for the first time in the history of all man's weapons has never resulted in a defensive weapon being created against it. The only thing we have is deterrence. The only thing we have is the knowledge that on both sides the punishment would be more than any nation could afford. If they started it, they would have to be prepared to accept virtually as much punishment as they were administering. And this has kept the peace.","I've had some meetings with young people who brought this very subject up, and they're greatly concerned. And I've asked them a question, and I must say they come up with a pretty sound answer. I've said, \"We're the only ones that have ever used a nuclear weapon—in Japan in World War II. Would we have used that weapon if we knew they also had that weapon and could use it back against us?\" And without fail, every group I've ever said this to has decided that, no, we would never have used the weapon.","[INTERVIEWER]. So, that's the real deterrent to war. [INTERVIEWED]. Yes, yes.","Central America","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in Central America recently there have been some apparently conciliatory gestures from Nicaragua. Do you think these are sincere moves, or are they propaganda ploys, and do you intend any response to them?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think that there is more they can do than they've done. I think the situation with them right now is covered by the words of Demosthenes in the Athenian marketplace 2,000 years ago when he said, \"What man would let another man's words, rather then his deeds, tell him who is at peace and who is at war with him?\"","[INTERVIEWER]. So, you don't think too much of these gestures then?","[INTERVIEWED]. No, we've made it plain. There, again, there's been contact. And Ambassador Stone has made it plain to them that all they have to do is reinstitute the principles of their own revolution—the things that they promised the people they were going to bring about if their revolution succeeded. And they have not done that. They betrayed their own revolution and created a totalitarian state.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, if you turn Demosthenes around, might the people in Managua not say, \"We want to see some deeds from the United States.\"","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, what hostile deeds have they seen?","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, they think of Grenada, for one. Maybe we think—maybe you think it was a very benign.— [INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think","[INTERVIEWER]. Rebel forces preparing to invade— [INTERVIEWED]. But those rebel forces are part of their own original revolution—the people that, once they succeeded, were ousted because they wanted to institute the democratic policies.","[INTERVIEWER]. But they're being armed by us.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we set out after the revolution succeeded—and prior to my administration, the previous administration immediately started to come to the financial aid, economic aid, to the Sandinista government until it found out that the Sandinista government was not keeping the promise of its revolution. And the aid was withdrawn.","Now, to invoke Grenada, here again I think the words of the Grenadian people themselves, the Governor General, the people of Grenada, our own people who were there and were rescued have revealed this was not an invasion. This was something in the nature of a commando operation, and it was a rescue mission. And the people of Grenada have made it very plain that they feel they, too, were rescued. And the fact that we have withdrawn our combat troops so precipitously, that some of the Grenadians are a little alarmed—that they don't think we should have left yet.","Pentagon Report on U.S. Marines' Security in Lebanon","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], have you seen the Pentagon report yet, or do you know anything about it? It's so critical of","[INTERVIEWED]. It has finally been delivered over here. It hasn't reached me as yet.","[INTERVIEWER]. Right. You have not been briefed — [INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. —- at all on it? [INTERVIEWED]. No.","[INTERVIEWER]. It sounds devastating.","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I'm not going to comment until I see it.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you have any—you don't really have any idea what's in it?","[INTERVIEWED]. No more than I read in the papers.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think that a lot of people are going to suffer from it? [INTERVIEWED]. I just—Helen, I just can't comment until I see it.","[INTERVIEWER]. We've all heard that it in some way criticizes everyone in the chain of command. Do you philosophically, or in any way, feel that that chain of command is-you're at the top of it in this case—and you bear some of that responsibility?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, there's no way to discount responsibility. As Commander in Chief, the operation could not have gone forward without my approval. And so, in that sense, I think the investigation was being very thorough. Yes, there would have been no mission without my decision to go forward with it.","The Middle East","[INTERVIEWER]. Mr. [INTERVIEWED], in Lebanon, [INTERVIEWED] Pertini of Italy today called for a withdrawal of the Italian contingent of the multinational force. Apparently there have been 15 countries who were asked to join that force and who have refused. Are you not concerned that the United States, by siding with Israel, is going to end up alone in Lebanon?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. I think that there was a not completely thorough statement of our meeting with Prime Minister Shamir. It was portrayed, and many people saw it, as somehow arriving at some new coalition with them, and even the word \"conspiracy\" was used by some in there. But, no, there was a reaffirmation by us of what our relationship with Israel has been since 1948. And we discussed this not from any standpoint of Israel and its relationship with Arab countries, in the sense of taking their part in anything of that kind. We're dedicated to the idea of trying, if we can, to act as a friend to both the Arab States and Israel in settling those longtime disputes and bringing about the kind of peace that we find between Egypt and Israel now.","[INTERVIEWER]. Do you think a U.N. force would be better in there?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would have wished from the very first for a U.N. force. But what has prevented it? The Soviet Union veto. If you look at the UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] force that is presently in the south of Lebanon, it is so bound by restrictions that were imposed in order to get the Soviet Union vote that it literally is helpless to do anything. It isn't that these people are ineffective or that they aren't capable, they are restricted.","[INTERVIEWER]. So then they couldn't possibly be replaced?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I could still hope that the Soviet Union now would recognize the value of having a U.N. force in there. And as I say, we would have preferred this from the very first, but it was something that couldn't be obtained. Where was I on—","[INTERVIEWER]. I was asking, aren't you concerned of the growing reluctance of your allies to assume part of the burden in Lebanon?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, we have been in communication. And I think that they understand better now, because we were just as forthright in talking to Prime Minister Shamir about our intentions in our dealings with the Arab States and the things that we were going to do in linkage with them. All of this aimed at being able—if a mediator can be of use in that peace process that we proposed—to ensure a fair solution to the problems. We have no plan that we're going to impose. That would be wrong of us to go in and say, \"Here is the peace plan.\" It must be negotiated out. On one side there is territory, on the other side there could be assurances of security. And someplace there has to be a balance in there in which one is traded for the other.","But that is up to them to negotiate. And I think our meeting with the Foreign Minister of Egypt, my own personal communication with [INTERVIEWED] Mubarak, other communications that we have made straightening out what the situation was and what our relationship with Israel is and what we want in a relationship with them. And I don't think—I think there was some discomfort at first; I don't think so any more.","Mr. Gergen. 1 Excuse me. You have a 3 o'clock meeting. Make this the last question.","[INTERVIEWER]. But is there any concern that 15 other allied nations are asked to join this force and have backed out, or","1 David R. Gergen, Assistant to the [INTERVIEWED] for Communications.","[INTERVIEWED]. Ah, but you're going back. Remember when—I think this was back when we were putting it together, we were trying to get forces that would join in it. Well, now, there could be a number of reasons why a nation wouldn't. There could be the very fact of cost to some nations. And remember, this recession has been worldwide.","So, whatever their reasons were—but this was back when we were trying to put the multinational force together. And I think the very fact that the United Kingdom, that Italy, France, and the United States were able to provide what we thought was an adequate force for the purpose we had in mind—","Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick","[INTERVIEWER]. We've got four true-and-false questions. Is Jeane Kirkpatrick leaving? [Laughter] Yes or no?","[INTERVIEWED]. No. Jeane came in as she has every year.","Possibility of U.S.-Soviet Summit [INTERVIEWER]. Will you go for a summit? [INTERVIEWED]. What?","[INTERVIEWER]. Will you go for a summit if the Soviets propose it?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I've always been willing to go if there is a possibility of accomplishing something.","Goals for 1984","[INTERVIEWER]. And what do you want to happen next year?","[INTERVIEWED]. I want the recovery to continue. I want us to achieve more control over spending. And therefore, I would hope that the press would reveal to the people of this country how valuable line-item—","[INTERVIEWER]. Veto. [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED]. —line-item veto could be in the helping to get control over extravagance.","[INTERVIEWER]. We'll tell them. [INTERVIEWED]. And—","[INTERVIEWER]. It will be in your budget proposal then?","[INTERVIEWED]. And I would hope that we would be far more advanced toward peace and toward a reduction of nuclear weapons. [INTERVIEWER]. And a new tax? [INTERVIEWED]. What? [INTERVIEWER]. A new tax?","[INTERVIEWED]. I would hope that that wouldn't be necessary.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you."]}

My guest today is the most consistent and most recognized newsmaker in the world. [INTERVIEWED] Gerald Ford is in St. Louis to attend a White House Conference on Domestic and Economic Affairs. The conference is billed as a town meeting, a chance for the [INTERVIEWED] and the members of his Administration to exchange views with the citizens of St. Louis.","Joining me in the questioning of Ford today are Richard Dudman, chief Washington correspondent of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jack Flach, political editor of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, and Bob Hardy, director of special events for KMOX Radio.","[INTERVIEWED], welcome to St. Louis, and thank you for making this your first stop.","THE [INTERVIEWED]'S SAFETY","[1.] [INTERVIEWER]. Our first question concerns a matter of major concern to the vast majority of Americans; that is, your personal safety. It is a frightening fact that a [INTERVIEWED] of the United States would have to wear a bulletproof vest, and we wonder whether this is going to become standard hardware, standard issue from the White House for future American [INTERVIEWED]s and yourself? We also wonder whether or not you feel that in the interest of national security, world security, you should modify your campaign style?","[INTERVIEWED]. Julius, let me say at the outset I don't think I should discuss whether I wear or don't wear--or whether I do something or don't do something that involves the security.","The Secret Service makes recommendations. I feel an obligation to follow their recommendations. But to identify, Julius, what I am doing or why I am doing it, involving security, I think makes security that much more difficult.","As to my desire to meet people when I come to either St. Louis or in New Hampshire, where I was yesterday, I feel it is important for the American people to have an opportunity to see firsthand, close-up, their [INTERVIEWED].","In any job, you know, there is a risk of some kind. I feel that you have to balance or weigh the risks as to my own personal security against what is a very important aspect of our political life in America.","It is helpful for me to meet with the people, shake hands with them, get their questions, and it is just as important for them to have me say hello or to answer their questions.","So, as I put the alternatives or the contending arguments on the scales, it seems to me that what is good for the country overbalances anything else.","[INTERVIEWER]. We can see that your vest today, that we can see, matches your suit and is quite attractive.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you.","THE [INTERVIEWED]'S SCHEDULE","[2.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], you seem to be doing more than just meeting the American people, though. You are actually campaigning at a breakneck speed, with the election still 14 months away. You seem to be campaigning as if it is going to happen next week. Why are you doing that? Are you afraid of Ronald Reagan as a possible rival? I'd like to ask you, also, if you think this is a wise use of your time when there are so many problems of government bearing on you?","[INTERVIEWED]. I will answer the last question first. I work a minimum of 12 hours a day, and usually it is 14, and the odd times that I take out to come to St. Louis, to New Hampshire, do not in any way whatsoever interfere with the conducting of White House business by me as [INTERVIEWED].","I have an excellent staff. They prepare the options for me to make decisions. I have ample time to read and to study. So, when I come to St. Louis, or Kansas City, where I am going, or New Hampshire yesterday, it in no way whatsoever interferes with the responsibilities I have, which are the highest, of being [INTERVIEWED] of the United States.","Now, I don't consider coming to St. Louis a campaign effort. I didn't go to New Hampshire yesterday for myself. I went there for the purpose of trying to elect a Republican candidate for the United States Senate.","Governor Reagan had been there the night before. That was not for me, but for him or for our party's candidate. So, any personal campaigning has been minimal. The aim and objective of coming here is to appear on this program, to attend a White House Conference, to help the Republican Party in Missouri and Kansas City. I don't consider it a personal campaign effort.","[3.] [INTERVIEWER]. Dudman also asked you another question, and that is regarding Reagan and your possible fear of his candidacy.","[INTERVIEWED]. Julius, I like competition in the political arena. Governor Reagan has not announced as a candidate yet. He has indicated either personally or through one of this representatives that he may sometime in November.","Governor Reagan was a fine Governor of the State of California. Until he announces his candidacy, I am assuming that I am the only Republican candidate, and I will welcome any competition. I love it.","[4.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], with the seeming inability of government to solve the Nation's critical problems--oil, energy, the economy, growing Federal spending--and the seeming preoccupation with intelligence probes and pay raises and recesses, what can be done to restore confidence, believability, and credibility in government?","[INTERVIEWED]. There are a number of things that I think can be helpful. There isn't any one thing that will answer the perplexing problem that you have posed.","I happen to believe that a [INTERVIEWED] traveling around the country, meeting people, is one way. The alternative for a [INTERVIEWED] is to sit in seclusion in the Oval Office. I don't think that adds to the credibility or improves or enhances the public impression of Washington.","On the other hand, I think the Congress, which is an integral part of our Government, one of the three major branches, has an opportunity to also project itself and to improve its credibility by the work that it does, the answers that it gives, and its efforts to meet firsthand the American people.","There are some substantive matters that have to be solved that would enhance the credibility of the Government as such. We are making slow progress but, I think, constructive progress, out of the recession. Employment has gone up by about 1.5 million in the last 5 months, even though the unemployment statistic is still too high.","We are making headway in meeting the challenge of inflation. It is half now what it was a year ago. It is not good enough. We are going to have to do better. But as we move forward in meeting the challenge of our economy, that will enhance our Government's credibility with 214 million people.","Also, energy must be solved, and this is probably the most frustrating domestic problem that I have faced. Having submitted a plan, a comprehensive program to make the United States invulnerable against foreign oil cartels in January, I hate to admit it, but the Congress has done nothing affirmative either on their plan--if they have one--or on my plan, which I submitted.","I think the American people are frustrated in this area, and our credibility as a government is harmed. I still think we can do something here, but we have to achieve this improved credibility two ways--by people in Government appearing to be human and by having the Government do things affirmatively.","[INTERVIEWER]. Flach.","[5.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], the latest poll shows that Nelson Rockefeller is not doing too well in the form of popularity. I wonder if you'd give us some thoughts on the polls and how much faith you have in him and whether Rockefeller continues to go this way that he won't be your running mate the next time around?","[INTERVIEWED]. Of course, you recognize the final decision as for myself as the Republican candidate and the Vice-[INTERVIEWED]ial candidate will be made by the delegates to the Republican Convention.","I am, of course, interested in the polls, both personally as well as concerning any other individual for [INTERVIEWED] or Vice [INTERVIEWED], but I don't think that should be the sole criteria.","I believe that a candidate for [INTERVIEWED] or Vice [INTERVIEWED] must be either approved or disapproved on the job that is done. If a [INTERVIEWED] does a good job, even though the immediate public opinion polls may not be favorable, I think the delegates ought to approve him, and the same for Vice [INTERVIEWED].","Now, in the case of Nelson Rockefeller, I picked him because he had done a fine job in New York State. He has done far better as Vice [INTERVIEWED] than I could possibly have expected. He is a hard worker. He is a good team player. He has got a vast amount of experience. I think those attributes will be watched, and the delegates will respond to them at the Republican Convention. So, based on performance and expectations, I would assume that the delegates would probably nominate him.","[INTERVIEWER]. If I may interpret, as we so-called political experts do, that sounds sort of like an endorsement for the Vice [INTERVIEWED].","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I certainly have to endorse the job he has done, no question about it.","BLACK AMERICANS","[6.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], in your speech to the National Baptist Convention,1 you promise that economic and social equality will become a reality for black Americans. That is a rather easy surface promise to make to a group that represents some 5.5 million potential votes. How do you plan to make that a reality, your promise?","[INTERVIEWED]. In the first place, we are going to get the economy as a whole out of the recession, and we are on our way now to, I think, a substantially improved economic picture. In the process of that, the black American will also benefit, as all other Americans will.","If we look back on the last 5 years, Julius, we find that more blacks have gone to college, more blacks are entering better paying jobs. We are doing our utmost to improve living conditions for all disadvantaged people, including blacks.","We are seeking to enforce very vigorously the equal employment opportunity legislation. I appointed a friend of mine from Michigan, Lowell Perry, who you may or may not know, as the new Chairman of that very important [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission, and they are going to do a good job.","So, through a combination of circumstances, the general improvement plus specific actions, I believe that blacks as a whole, particularly those in the lower end of the spectrum economically, will be the beneficiaries.","[7.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], I'd like to ask you a question about the Middle East. The United States, for the first time, is becoming directly involved there, and quite deeply, with the prospect of stationing technicians. Don't you owe it to the American people in these circumstances to make public every American commitment that is being made and every detail of the deal that the United States has helped bring about between Israel and Egypt?","[INTERVIEWED]. We have submitted all of the official documents to the two committees in the Congress--the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on International Relations--and Secretary Kissinger has testified to those two committees and the two Armed Services Committees.","We are working out arrangements to give the documents that I mentioned plus the content of any other communications between me and the heads of state. of Egypt on the one hand and Israel on the other.","Now, we have committed to give the content of those documents and those communications, but I do not think--it has never been done in the past--that a direct communication between a [INTERVIEWED] and another head of state should be made public. As long as the content is there, the commitment is there. I think that is adequate assurance to the American people.","I would add, the commitment that we have made at the request of Egypt on the one hand and Israel on the other--they made them to us--authorizing up to 200 U.S. technicians, nonmilitary, in a U.N. buffer zone--all of the details concerning that part of the agreement will be made public.","[INTERVIEWER]. The exact words, though, won't be available. The sense of it will be filtered through selected Congressmen and Senators. Is that not right?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, the exact words of our commitment of up to but not more than 200 American technicians will be made public, no question about that.","[INTERVIEWER]. I understand that, but things like the level of aid that is to be given to Israel and--","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, no, no, I must correct the record there. There is a negotiation going on now between the United States and Israel as to the amount of the first year's aid, economic and military.","When I submit the budget request for the total foreign aid program on a worldwide basis, I will submit the details of the request of economic and military aid for Israel just as I will do it in the case of Egypt. But that will all come as a part of the package for the total worldwide foreign aid program.","[8.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], it has been suggested that we use our grain for Soviet oil or for somebody's oil. You currently have someone working on that in the Soviet Union now, we are told. What kind of a deal do you see, sir?","[INTERVIEWED]. We have a high level group of negotiators under Assistant (Under) Secretary of State Robinson in Moscow now negotiating for a long-term purchase agreement by the Soviet Union up to, say, 5 years for American grain and other agricultural products. We feel that a long-term agreement with minimums and maximums is in the best interests of the farmer and the country, as well as our relations with the Soviet Union.","Now, there are some very preliminary discussions going on concerning grain and oil, but they have not gone beyond very preliminary discussions.","[INTERVIEWER]. Have you reached some level of amounts when you talk in terms of oil? Have you set a figure or a number of barrel amount?","[INTERVIEWED]. We have no specifics, because these are preliminary discussions. The Soviet Union, we understand, does have a surplus of oil. We have a surplus of grain. So, at least we ought, in a very preliminary way, just discuss any alternatives, but we have not gone beyond that.","[INTERVIEWER]. Has any kind of barter arrangement--if the Soviet Union cannot supply the oil in exchange for grain, are you hoping that they will exert their influence over the Arabs who listen to them?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think there is a better way to exercise our influence with the Arab nations, and that is through the International Energy Agency, which was set up or promoted primarily by the United States about a year ago, where the basic industrial consuming nations have joined together to meet with the producing nations, OPEC, for example.","We are negotiating directly with them. I think that has more potential than relying on the Soviet Union to help us with the Arab nations. Our relations with the Arab nations are good. I don't think we have to go through the Soviet Union in this case or any other case, as far as dealing with Arab nations.","[9.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], if Israel is expelled from the United Nations, would the United States withdraw, and can you foresee any circumstances that might prompt the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N.? [INTERVIEWED]. I don't expect the United Nations to kick Israel out, and of course, the United States would vigorously protest and vote against any such effort on the part of any nation or nations. We believe that the prospects for that happening have subsided considerably, particularly since the agreement between Egypt on the one hand and Israel on the other.","If we can continue to have momentum in the Middle East--which I think will continue--the prospects of Arab nations and other nonaligned nations trying to kick Israel out becomes less and less.","In other words, the position of Israel in the United Nations becomes stronger as we keep momentum going for a solution, a long-term solution, to the problems in the Middle East.","To answer your last question, I foresee no circumstances where the United States would leave the United Nations. I think it would be a mistake. It is good for us to be a part of that forum, to have an influence --","[INTERVIEWER]. You know we have had problems there in the past.","[INTERVIEWED]. We have problems in other forums as well. I have always found the best way to win a game is to play it, not to sit on the sidelines. And the United States ought to be in the game in the United Nations to protect our interests. It is a lot better inside than sitting out doing nothing.","[INTERVIEWER]. Would it be in the interests of the United States to try to arrive at. a formula sometime so that North and South Vietnam could enter the United Nations? They were vetoed this time because of the connection with Korea. But isn't it true that the United States continues to have a great interest in that part of the world, and isn't there a danger that relations with North and South Vietnam can get into a deep freeze the way China and Cuba did for so many years, to nobody's advantage?","[INTERVIEWED]. We believe in the universality of the United Nations. We feel that it is in the interest of the world as a whole to have all nations that want to become a part of the United Nations be members, but the effort of North and South Vietnam to get in was predicated on their coming in alone. We felt if North and South Vietnam were to be a part of the United Nations, South Korea, that has had its application in to be a member for a good many years, also ought to be included. You can't be selective on who or what nation should be a part of the United Nations.","I presume, based on our overall interest in matters involving Southeast Asia, that it is conceivable under certain circumstances that our relations with North and South Vietnam will improve, but a lot has to happen.","For example, North Vietnam continues to refuse to give us information concerning the MIA's, and they try to bribe us by saying, \"We will give you information about MIA's if you will let us in the United Nations.\"","Well, North Vietnam agreed in January of 1973 to give us information, to give us access to North Vietnam to find the MIA's, and they have not lived up to it. So, how can we trust them? They have got a lot of things to do before we are going to be very receptive to their participation.","[10.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], busing is a subject and a practice that is distasteful to a large segment of the American population, both black and white. If it is such a distasteful and wasteful process, why bus? And is there any alternative that you see?","[INTERVIEWED]. I think we have to decide in the first place what we are really trying to do by busing before you discuss whether it is good or bad. All of us-white, black, every American, in my opinion--wants quality education.","Now, the Court decided in 1954 that separate but equal schools were unconstitutional, and the courts have decided that busing is one way to try and desegregate on the one hand and perhaps improve education on the other.","Many of those decisions have raised great problems in many, many localities-Louisville and Boston being the most prominent at the present time.","Discussing those two communities, let me very strongly emphasize the Court has decided something. That is the law of the land. As far as my Administration is concerned, the law of the land will be upheld, and we are upholding it.","But then I think I have the right to give what I think is a better answer to the achievement of quality education, which is what we all seek. And there is always more than one answer. I think that quality education can be enhanced by better school facilities, lower pupil-teacher ratios, the improvement of the neighborhood, as such. Those are better answers, in my judgment, than busing under a court order.","Quality education can be achieved by more than one method. I was reading in the Washington Post this morning a column by one of the outstanding black columnists, Raspberry. And Raspberry has come to the conclusion that court-ordered forced busing is not the way to achieve quality education for blacks or whites in a major metropolitan area. That is a very significant decision by Raspberry, who I think Dudman, for example, highly respects.","[INTERVIEWER]. I certainly do. In Boston and Louisville, where the court has ordered busing, how well do you think the people of those two cities have conducted themselves in bringing about court-ordered exchanges of black and white students? [INTERVIEWED]. There has been some disorders there over the last year or more.","[INTERVIEWER]. I am thinking about this fall. There have been Federal agents there, of course, to try to maintain order. Are you reasonably well satisfied with the way things have happened or not?","[INTERVIEWED]. So far there has been a minimum of local disorder. I hope that that attitude can prevail in the months ahead as the police involvement and the Federal marshal involvement becomes less and less. I am always an optimist, even though I disagree with the method by which they are trying to achieve quality education.","[INTERVIEWER]. Well, are you counseling the people of those two cities to cooperate with the courts, or are you encouraging them to maintain their strong feelings in some cases that this is an improper solution?","[INTERVIEWED]. Last year I did a televised tape urging the people of Boston. to cooperate with the court and to maintain law and order.2 I did that then, and I have counseled everybody that I talked with in Boston to encourage their fellow Bostonians to obey the law and follow the court's action.","[INTERVIEWER]. We have time for one short question and one short answer.","1976 [INTERVIEWED]IAL CAMPAIGN","[11.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], assuming your nomination, will you agree to broadcast debates with the nominee of the other party?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, that gets into some problems involving the current law. I am not sure that a public debate on television is the best way for the public to analyze a candidate. I don't rule it out, but I won't make any firm commitment at this time.","[INTERVIEWER]. What about a public debate on radio?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I think it is a possibility, but I would not want to make a firm commitment at this time.","MRS. FORD","[12.] [INTERVIEWER]. [INTERVIEWED], a cartoon in the newspaper recently mentioned that your wife's comments on the CBS program \"Face the Nation\" [\"60 Minutes\"] would only hurt your campaign if she ran against you. [Laughter] How do you feel about that?","[INTERVIEWED]. Well, I am very proud of her, and we have had a wonderful marriage. We have in our family the right of Betty, as well as the children, to speak their minds. I think she was misunderstood to some extent, but I repeat, I am proud of her and we have had a very happy marriage.","[INTERVIEWER]. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED], for being with us today in St. Louis. Welcome, again.","[INTERVIEWED]. Thank you."]}

You first time met with President Putin in Slovenia, and now in Slovakia is going to be your 12th meeting. What kind do you think we need now? Do we need a fresh start? And what do you expect for this meeting?","[INTERVIEWED]. You know, it's interesting. First of all, we don't need a fresh start in my personal relationship with Vladimir Putin. We're friends, and that's important. It's important so that we can he and I can have good talks, and we can understand each other and understand the decision-making process.","Vladimir makes a lot of decisions. And I make a lot of decisions. And I like to talk about him about, \"Well, why did you do this?\" or \"Why did you do that?\" And I suspect he likes to ask me the same questions.","Secondly, we've got the framework for a good strategic relationship, which is important. I think this relationship can be invigorated. The campaign came, and in American public life, I mean whether it be foreign policy or domestic policy, often you kind of shut down when the campaign comes. People weren't really sure who was going to be the next President for a while. It turned out to be me, thankfully. But and so this is a chance to reinvigorate. I wouldn't say fresh fresh start is okay. I'd call it reinvigorate. We've got the framework, and it gives us a chance to move it forward.

I mean, it was a great lesson for bravery.","And same in our country they call it the \"Greatest Generation\"; that's what they call the World War II people because they sacrificed.

The enemy there's a set of beliefs they believe in, and I believe the best way to defeat those beliefs is by spreading freedom and democracy. Free societies don't like to fight.

{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksnationalcancerinstituterecommendationsmammographyandexchangewithreporters","text":["[SPEAKER]. Secretary Shalala has just briefed me on the National Cancer Institute's new recommendations on mammography. These recommendations, based on the latest and best medical evidence, give clear, consistent guidance to women in our national fight against breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects one in eight women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly every American, including my own.","We may not yet have a cure for breast cancer, but we do know that early detection and early treatment are our most potent weapons against this dread disease and we know that mammography can save lives. That is why it's important to send a clear, consistent message to women and to their families about when to start getting mammograms and how often to repeat them.","After careful study of the science, the National Cancer Advisory Board has now concluded that women between the ages of 40 and 49 should get a mammography examination for breast cancer every 1 or 2 years, in consultation with their doctors. The National Cancer Institute has now accepted these recommendations. Now women in their forties will have clear guidance based on the best science, and action to match it.","Today I am taking action to bring Medicare, Medicaid, and the Federal employee health plans in line with the National Cancer Institute's recommendations. First, in the Medicare budget I am sending to Congress today I am making annual screening mammography exams, beginning at age 40, a covered expense without coinsurance or deductibles. Second, Secretary Shalala is sending a letter to State Medicaid directors urging them to also cover annual mammograms beginning at 40 and assuring them that the Federal Government will pay its matching share if they do so. And today I am directing the Office of Personnel Management to require all Federal health benefit plans to comply with the National Cancer Advisory Board's recommendations on mammogram screenings, beginning next year.","The Federal Government is doing its part to make sure women have both coverage and access to this potentially lifesaving test. I want to challenge private health insurance plans to do the same. They, too, should cover regular screening mammograms for women 40 and over.","Finally, we know there has been much discussion on this issue and a lot of confusion. That is why we are launching a major public education campaign to make sure every woman and every health care professional in America, that all of them are aware of these new recommendations. This is a major step forward in our fight against breast cancer.","In addition to Secretary Shalala, I want to thank National Cancer Advisory Board Chairperson Dr. Barbara Rimer and all the members of the Board, along with the NCI Director, Dr. Richard Klausner, for the fine job that they did in producing these recommendations.","I also want to thank the First Lady, who could not be with us here because of her visit to Africa. She has devoted countless hours to educating women about the importance of mammography, and this is a happy day for her. She has especially tried to educate older women to take advantage of the Medicare coverage of mammograms, because we know that too few of them still do. And that's the last point I would like to make. These guidelines and this coverage, it's all very good, but unless women are willing to actually take advantage of the coverage, we won't have the full benefit of the recommendations and the findings that have been made.","Now I'd like to turn the microphone over to Secretary Shalala to make a few comments.","[INTERVIEWER] [SPEAKER], do you have any comment on the mass suicide in California?","[SPEAKER]. Well, of course, all I know is what I read about it this morning and what I saw last night reported. But it's heartbreaking; it's sickening; it's shocking. I think it's important that we get as many facts as we can about this and try to determine what, in fact, motivated those people and what all of us can do to make sure that there aren't other people thinking in that same way out there in our country, that aren't so isolated that they can create a world for themselves that may justify that kind of thing. It's very troubling to me. But I don't think I know enough to make a definitive comment about it.","[INTERVIEWER] [SPEAKER], switching gears on another subject, the Democratic Party emerged from this most recent election in the aftermath of all of these fundraising problems it seems to be in pretty bad shape financially enormous debt that they can't repay. What, if anything, can you do about this, and how much responsibility do you have to try to get the Democratic Party back into shape?","[SPEAKER]. Oh, a lot, and I have been doing a lot, and I will do more. We knew that we would have to spend last year when it became obvious that our congressional candidates were going to be outspent massively, we did everything we could to raise a good deal of money at the end. But the committees and the Democratic Committee went into debt with money that they could legally borrow in the hope of trying to be competitive. They actually did a pretty good job. They were still outspent, I figure, in the last 10 days, 2 weeks, probably 4 or 5 to 1 in all of the contested races. But we knew that would happen, and we knew it would take some time to pay it back. But I'm not particularly concerned about it. I think we will pay it back. And it was, I thought, important.","Keep in mind, we were at the bottom of the barrel in November of '94, and in 1995 we did a good job, I think, of building our party back and showing what the clear differences were between the two parties. And the previous leadership of the party deserves a lot of credit. We got up to a million small donors, and they're coming back now. They're beginning to make their contributions, and that's very encouraging. So I think we'll get there. I'm not particularly concerned about it.","We made a deliberate decision to kind of downplay the Inaugural and not to try to tie too much of that to fundraising, so we're going to have to work harder this year. But I've been doing some work, as you know, and I will continue to do more.","[INTERVIEWER] Do you think Governor Romer has second thoughts about some of the changes that previously eliminating contributions from subsidiaries of foreign companies and also non-U.S. citizens he seems to be having some second thoughts about some of those proposals you made over the past few months.","[SPEAKER]. Well, let me say, I still don't believe I think, on balance, it's better policy to say that people who can't vote shouldn't contribute. In terms of the subsidiaries, the real problem there is the law says if the money is made in the United States, it can be given in the United States. The problem is, how do you ever know that? And so I think that he was trying to bend over backwards to get us off on the right foot.","But I'd be willing to talk to him about it. But the main thing is we're just going to have to get together and work hard and rally our troops and remind them of what we're trying to do here, how we're trying to balance the budget, what we're trying to do for education, what we're trying to do to move the country forward and get the efforts going. We've had several successful events this year. We just have to do more. And we knew what you have to do after an election, when we saw all this third party money and all these other things coming down the pike, we wanted to give our Members of Congress a chance to be competitive, and so we undertook to do so. And I'm glad we did, but we're just going to have to work double hard now to pay the money back, and we'll do that. We'll pay our debts, and we'll make our budget this year.","[INTERVIEWER] Have you received any updates from Ambassador Ross or the Vice President?","[SPEAKER]. Yes.","[INTERVIEWER] And what have they been?","[SPEAKER]. Well, Ambassador Ross had a very good meeting with Chairman Arafat, and he's proceeding now on his trip. And I don't have anything else to tell you, but he was encouraged by the response of Chairman Arafat to the matters that we discussed here before he left.","I started the day this morning with physical therapy and a talk with the Vice President in China, which was also good therapy. [Laughter] And he said to me that in every aspect, his trip had gone quite well and better than he had anticipated, and he was anxious to get back and give me a report on all the issues that we're concerned about. But I think the trip has been a real validation for our strategy of engagement with China, of taking our agreements, our disagreements, our matters of common interest, our matters of concern directly to them. And he is very pleased with the results so far, and I certainly am very pleased with the work he's done, with the speech he gave on human rights and with all the work that he's done in China so far. I'm encouraged about it. I think the trip has been well worth making.","[INTERVIEWER] Have you seen that Janet Reno gave Louis Freeh a ringing endorsement this morning every confidence in his leadership at the FBI?","[SPEAKER]. Well, as I said of course, she works with him every day, and that's why I said yesterday what I did. I was troubled by the headline in the New York Times story, but I did not know the facts. And I think it's important for me not to assume that someone has done or failed to do something that's adverse to the national interest before I know it's true. And she's the one that has to make those calls. And as she said in her comments, the system that we have [SPEAKER] appoints the Director of the FBI, but the FBI is a part of the Justice Department. It's a part of the justice system. And whenever you have dual responsibilities in the Government, you're going to have some time when you've got to make a close call.","And I still don't know as I said, I just literally don't know I could actually tell you whether I agreed or disagreed, if I knew what if and what information had not been forthcoming to the National Security Council. I do believe that there should be a that doubt should be resolved in favor of disclosure to the National Security Council of essential national security information. But the Attorney General has to resolve those things. And I trust her to do it. And so, what she said is fine by me.","[INTERVIEWER] Is there a problem if [SPEAKER] of the United States a lot of Americans simply don't understand [SPEAKER] of the United States says, \"I don't know that there's a problem because I haven't necessarily been given\"","[SPEAKER]. Well, I think there is. Yes, I think there is. If I knew that one existed, I would agree that there was a problem. But I don't know it. And I'm still not sure that there was. I just have to I have to trust the Attorney General to make sure that the National Security Council gets the information that we need to make good national security judgments here. I think, for example, in the Khobar Towers incident, there is absolutely not a shred of evidence that there's anything that we have been denied. And so, if I knew that there was and I knew what it was and I thought there was a mistake, I'd be happy to say that there's an honest disagreement here, but I just don't know that there is one.","[INTERVIEWER] Has your administration been hamstrung in terms of ambassadorial appointments, appointments at the State Department and so forth because of all of these investigations on the campaign?","[SPEAKER]. No, not at all. As a matter of fact, we've been working on getting ready for the next round of ambassadorial appointments. I approved a small number of them, oh, probably a couple of weeks ago so we could move in critical countries. But the others we're trying to do on a schedule which at least guarantees that all the Ambassadors now serving will do the traditional 3-year tour of duty. So we have some time on them. But we've worked very hard for the last month or so on that, and I don't see those two things as in conflict or a problem at all.","Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER] How do you feel today?","[SPEAKER]. I feel fine. Every day I'm getting a little more mobile, and I'm getting able to, you know, do a little more. I'll tell you one thing, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. But it's been a very enlightening experience, a very humbling experience. And the respect that I feel now for people who spend all day every day in a wheelchair or people who spend all day every day in braces and on crutches is enormous.","The dignity and the strength of character that it takes to kind of organize your life and carry it out if you're always subject to some sort of significant physical disability is enormous. These are things that we all sometimes see, but when you've felt just a little taste of it, when you realize what it means to be able to just navigate and do the basic things in life just to dress yourself for the first time when you couldn't do it, for example it just makes you understand that the rest of us in society who have been fortunate enough to have full use of our physical facilities owe an enormous amount of respect and sensitivity to people who don't.","It's just been a stunning experience for me. I mean, I will never again see a person who has to deal with a disability in the same light again. I mean, it's just it's had a profound impact. It's nothing I didn't know before, but feeling it and knowing it are two different things.","[INTERVIEWER] Thank you, [SPEAKER].","[SPEAKER]. Thank you.","[INTERVIEWER] Like your doctor after you all the time?","[SPEAKER]. Yes. She just wants to make sure I don't blow it.","[INTERVIEWER] I see her we see her right here.","[SPEAKER]. There she is.","[INTERVIEWER] She's watching.","[SPEAKER]. These crutches are quite good. This way you can walk by putting your bad leg down and keeping the weight here. Otherwise, you have to just do this and then kind of do that. But if you can walk, it's a lot easier; the chances of falling are less.","[INTERVIEWER] They're better than the traditional crutches.","[SPEAKER]. Yes, much better."]}

{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkssigningthejobtrainingpartnershipact","text":["[SPEAKER]. Well, hello and welcome to all of you. It's wonderful to have you here and to see you joining in this important step forward for America.","Twenty-one months ago this country was in the grip of not one, but five severe problems: runaway government spending, double-digit inflation, record high interest rates they'd just hit 21 1/2 percent the worst tax burden in peacetime history, and high unemployment. With support from the American people we put in place a program that was designed to cure this raging economic disease which had been ignored for too many years. Little more than a year's passed since our program went on the books, but already we've made solid progress against four of the five problems that we inherited.","We have cut the growth of spending somewhere around in half, and we've reduced high inflation, high interest rates, and taxation. But let me just say something here about interest rates, which I'll expand on in my speech to the Nation tonight.","The very sharp and heartening decline that we've seen in interest rates brings us one step closer to the dream every American shares, which is lasting recovery. But let's understand that what brought, for example, Government-backed home mortgages down to 12 1/2 percent, the lowest level in 25 months, was not a quick fix, but our progress against inflation. The decline in inflation led directly to the fall in interest rates during the last several months. The Federal Reserve Bank announced last week that it was lowering its discount level to 9 1/2 percent. That's the first time this key interest rate has been a single digit since 1979 and the fifth reduction in the rate in 4 months.","The Fed's lower rate shows its confidence that inflation and market interest rates are continuing to fall. The Federal Reserve has been pursuing a steady policy of trying to reduce inflation, and we've been supporting the Fed in that policy. And the Fed will continue to aim its policy at bringing inflation down further in the future. And that will continue to mean lower and lower interest rates as well.","As I said, we're solving four of the five worst problems that we inherited. But unemployment, always the lagging indicator, remains too high, and clearly, our most urgent priority today is to create lasting, private sector jobs. I'm not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find a job.","Unemployment is a tragedy for all Americans in every region, every city, and every line of work. We need the strength of every back and the power of every mind to lift our nation from the economic swamp to higher ground. We must not waste the energy of one citizen who wants to work.","All of us are moved by the plight of millions of our people who can't find jobs or provide for their families. Perhaps the cruelest trap of all has caught the legions of our youth. As they stand on the threshold of the American dream, far too many find the door of opportunity slammed in their face. Two out of every five people out of work-two out of every five are between the ages of 16 and 24.","We continue to push for enterprise zones in our inner cities, a program to attract new businesses and jobs to areas of highest unemployment. It's tragic that this enterprise zone proposal has been bottled up in committee by the leadership of the House.","I remember what it was like to be 21 years old and looking for a job in 1932. And I know how it feels when your future has been mortgaged by the generation before you. And that's a tragic mistake we must never allow our leaders to make again. Today's young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past.","The only way to avoid making these mistakes again is to learn from them. It's estimated, for example, that at least 20 million American workers now rely on skills that won't be needed within 20 years. The government has trained thousands more in skills that already aren't needed in their communities. Still others have been steered into make-work government for our young people. And that's why I'm proud today to sign into law the Job Training Partnership Act, a program that looks to the future instead of the past.","This is not another make-work, dead-end, bureaucratic boondoggle. This program will train more than one million Americans every year in skills they can market where they live. It'll make a difference on Main Street. It'll provide help, bring hope, and encourage self-reliance and personal initiative. And here's how it'll work.","State and local government officials, business and labor leaders, and other members of the private sector will plan area programs in private industry councils. Local people will decide at the grass roots level what opportunities are available in their communities, and then match real jobs with needed skills.","And here's something else that makes this program different from many past failures. At least 70 percent of the program funds will go to actual job training. We're eliminating the bureaucratic and administrative waste that has marked so many so-called job bills in the past.","There's another reason for confidence in this measure. It's based on a tried and tested concept. The young people that are with me here today have already benefited from local programs very similar to the one we're about to enact nationwide. And I'm going to give some examples.","Emmanuel Clark here a high school student from Richmond. He learned clerical skills and found a part-time job in a law firm because of New Horizons, a training program in this area.","Bienvenido Martinez, who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, received on-the-job training sponsored by the Washington, D.C., Private Industry Council and now works part-time as a computer operator while attending college. A little while ago I told him what a change this was between generations, because I worked my way through college washing dishes in the girls' dormitory.","And Paige Davis, who once supported three children on unemployment benefits, enrolled in the Urban League Word-Processing Training Program. She graduated in 1979, began work for the Booker T. Washington Foundation, and did so well that-she told me a little earlier she's starting a business of her own as a consultant in word processing.","Now, these are just three examples of the opportunity this approach holds for millions of Americans. Long-time workers who've lost their jobs because of new technology, women who can't find work because their home-making skills aren't marketable, young people who aren't hired because they have no experience all will be helped by this program.","And let me just add a special word of thanks to Senators Hatch and Quayle and Kennedy and Congressmen Jeffords, Erlenborn, and Hawkins for their leadership in getting this legislation passed.","And now, if you young people will just pay attention or gather around close, I'm going to sign the bill. That's the bill. I only sign the last page.","Reporter. Well, you know the Democrats are calling this blatant election-year politics, [SPEAKER].","[SPEAKER]. That doesn't surprise me a bit. But it doesn't make it any more true.","Q. Is it true, [SPEAKER]?","[SPEAKER]. What?","Q. Is it true?","[SPEAKER]. No.","Q. Why not?","[SPEAKER]. Because this is the type of program that we've been talking about that's really going to accomplish something.","Deputy Press Secretary Speakes. That's enough. It's not a press conference. I'm sorry.","[SPEAKER]. Isn't he mean? I was enjoying it.","Q. But you're free to continue, sir.","Q. You're [SPEAKER].","[SPEAKER]. No, I can't do that. But I want you to know though, as I say, all these young people are an example of what these kind of programs can do, and out there government has a legitimate function. But that legitimate function, I think, in this area means cooperating and working with the private sector, where the jobs with a future really are.","And thank you all for being here.."]}
{"discourse_type":1,"id":"presidencyucsbedudocumentsthepresidentsnewsconference450","text":["For several reasons, I shall want to take some of the time available to us today, actually to read to you a statement. Now, Mr. Hagerty tells me that a mimeograph of it is being made and is going to be over here before the conference is ended. If that is true, I suggest there is no need for your making notes during the time I am dealing with this paper.","The paper deals with an approach to the security problem, and there are three reasons that I should like to take it up today.","First, I have sent down today to the Congress a reorganizational plan for the Defense Department. It is not radical in most ways, certainly, but it does attempt to point up that organization so as to secure a greater effectiveness, economy, speed in action, and more rapid production of materiel that has been appropriated for.","Another reason is that there is just back, as you know, from Europe, a team which the administration sent over there: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, and the Director of Mutual Security. They have all returned, or at least all have returned except Secretary Wilson; and we have been having conferences on this same global problem.","And finally, I met this morning with some of the legislative leaders, and we had this problem up for a long and exhaustive discussion. So I want to give you really the approach that we are now making toward this problem.","I would like to present to you in a general way, and with fairly broad strokes, what I consider the sensible framework within which the United States and its allies can present in hard military fact an ever more effective posture of defense. A true posture of defense is composed of three factors--spiritual, military, and economic. Today I shall talk only about the last two.","We Americans have frequently called for unity of basic purpose among our allies. I feel quite strongly that the least we can do is to display a similar continuity and unity in American purpose.","This policy of ours, therefore, will not be tied to any magic, critical year which then has to be \"stretched out\" because of economic or production problems, but will be based on the sounder theory that a very real danger not only exists this year, but may continue to exist for years to come; that our strength, which is already very real, must now be made stronger, not by inefficient and expensive starts and stops, but by steady continuous improvements.","I have always firmly believed that there is a great logic in the conduct of military affairs. There is an equally great logic in economic affairs. If these two logical disciplines can be wedded, it is then possible to create a situation of maximum military strength within economic capacities.","If, on the other hand, these two are allowed to proceed in disregard one for the other, you then create a situation either of doubtful military strength, or of such precarious economic strength that your military position is in constant jeopardy.","It has been the purpose of this administration ever since it took office, finding itself confronted with a crazy quilt of promises, commitments, and contracts, to bring American military logic and American economic logic into joint strong harness.","No more glaring illustration of the lack of balance between the military logic and the economic logic could possibly be found than the situation that existed when we took office. On the one hand, we found our allies deploring our unfulfilled defense promises. On the other hand, we found there was a total carryover of $81 billion in appropriated funds, largely committed, for which cash must be provided from revenues in future fiscal years, over and above the normal annual cost of government. It's just as if the late administration had gone to the store and ordered 81 billion dollars worth of goods, which we've got to pay for as they're delivered, in addition to paying the regular household running expenses.","The fiscal situation represented by these two extremes absolutely has to be brought into some kind of realistic focus, and the only way to do it is to have a completely new, fresh look without any misleading labels.","As you know, over the past years I have been involved in the European end of defense, and therefore I think I know all about paper divisions and cardboard wings. For the last 3 months, I have been heavily involved in the American end of defense, and day after day have had to struggle with the basic equation that links the military safety of this country and of the free world with the ability of the world to pay its bills and earn a living.","This morning I told the legislative leaders that already we can see our way clear to ask the Congress to appropriate at least 8 ½ billion less in new money for the fiscal year 1954 than had been asked for by the previous administration. This is a preliminary figure based on 3 months' hard work. The great bulk of it, of course, relates to security programs. More definite figures will become available as appropriation requests are presented to the Congress during the next few weeks.","You will note that I have been talking about the new appropriations for fiscal 1954. Actual cash savings for 1954 will be determined only as Congress acts on the appropriation requests.","These savings will not reduce the effective military strength we will deliver to ourselves and our allies during fiscal 1954. [Interrupts reading] Those deliveries are already appropriated for. They are already on the books and in contracts. [Continues reading]: Deliveries actually will be speeded up through the reduction of lead time, and concentration on producing those items which make the most military sense for the immediate future.","Establishing the most effective relationship between defense requirements and economic capability in these days is probably the most complex and ramified problem to be faced by any government. Practically everyone concerned with the problem can with some justification be a special pleader.","But I am sure that what the overwhelming majority of Americans want to believe is that their Government is working with diligence and intelligence to bring about as rapidly as possible a condition of true military strength. I also believe that the overwhelming majority of the people of the free world appreciate the fact that a healthy American economy and a functioning economy in their own home country are inseparable from true defense.","Furthermore, I have a deep conviction that all these people possess a fundamental common sense Which permits them to grasp the difference between a quiet, steady, long-term improvement in their defense position and the tempests stirred up by public arguments over the artificial arithmetic which is so easy to produce in the defense field.","The program we are presenting is a long-term program, calling for a steady and adequate flow of men and materials to present a position of genuine strength to any would-be aggressor.","The basic elements of our strategic problem have not materially changed in recent years, and certainly not in recent days. The areas and peoples vital to our Nation's welfare are the same as they have been for a long time. What we are doing is to adopt a new policy for the solution of the problem.","This change in policy is radical and cannot be effected overnight. There exists what is, in effect, a straitjacket, comprising prior authorizations, appropriations, and contracts.","The essence of the change is this. We reject the idea that we must build up to a maximum attainable strength for some specific date theoretically fixed for a specified time in the future. Defense is not a matter of maximum strength for a single date. It is a matter of adequate protection to be projected as far into the future as the actions and apparent purposes of others may compel us.","It is a policy that can, if necessary, be lived with over a period of years.","Finally, I would like to remind you of what I have said many times before, and will probably say many times again.","Security based upon heavy armaments is a way of life that has been forced upon us and on our allies. We don't like it; in fact, we hate it. But so long as such an unmistakable, self-confirmed threat to our freedom exists, we will carry these burdens with dedication and determination.","Our hope and our prayer is that this dedication and determination will bring about a world condition when we can once again return to the arts of peace, which we have always and will always cherish above all other arts.","That is the end of my statement. I read it because I wanted to make it exactly as I have been thinking over it in these recent days. Now gentlemen, the rest of the time is yours."," [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], can you tell us of any specific field in which there will be a reduction, say, in the size of forces, or what effect this might have, say, on the Air Force, its plans to build up to--I think it's 143 groups?","[INTERVIEWED] As to long-term objectives that may have been specified, I can't tell you exactly what will be the effect. But I can tell you this: there will be more buildup in 1954 than was possible under the operations and the activities as they were proceeding in January of this year. This is due to the shortening up of lead times, and the concentration on critical areas and items.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: May I put it this way, [INTERVIEWED]? As a result of these cuts, will we have fewer people in the armed services in the days ahead?","[INTERVIEWED] If you look far enough ahead, Mr. Folliard, that is possibly true. We cannot tell yet, because we have been here only 90 days. There is a tremendous job of inspecting and analyzing of forces, personnel, activities throughout the world. It stretches all the way around the world, this activity of which we are speaking. It is impossible to find the utmost of efficiency, businesslike methods, starting right back at the production line, until you get to the end. So until we know what those examinations, analyses, and corrections will yield, we cannot say what the final result will be.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], this increased buildup in 1954, will that be in all three of the armed forces?","[INTERVIEWED] I should think so.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: In general?","[INTERVIEWED] Again I say I should think so; and I say this advisedly: we have been going over these things--you do get a little bit confused in trying to remember exact detail.","But the fact is that in this coming year, there is nothing deducted in the way of money, and there is added the idea of shortening up of lead times, and getting these things proper.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: If you attain this preliminary figure of an $8½ billion decrease, sir, will that not mean a balanced Federal budget in the coming fiscal year?","[INTERVIEWED] No, it does not, because I particularly specified new money, money that you are requesting in new authorizations. To be exact, the budget now before the Congress asked for 72.9 billion. This is an 8.4--at least in that order, 8 1/2--reduction in that, that we now believe we can do after this 90 days. And I am giving you that, as I say, as a tentative figure. But that is not the deficit. The deficit comes about from the amount of the appropriated money of this year that will be spent, added to the amount of carried-over money that will be spent, and deduct from that your anticipated revenues. Incidentally, anticipated revenues will probably be a bit lower. Now, that is the deficit. Therefore the 9.9 which you probably had in your mind will not be reduced by 8.5. No, it will not.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: I want to get straightened out, is this 8.5 just in defense and military aid, or is it the overall?","[INTERVIEWED] Overall, and I said, the great bulk of which, of course, is in security programs.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Will you give us some figures on military and foreign aid?","[INTERVIEWED] No.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: At least one Member of Congress has said your 8.5 savings in appropriations will be translated into a 4.4 savings in expenditures. Do you have such a figure? In other words, actual spending?","[INTERVIEWED] We have, of course, dealt with all kinds of figures, and the reason I told you that--actual figures or estimates are not going to be available until we go before Congress, Because there is no sense in creating confusion. We are not certain of those figures, and there will be changes, both in the expenditure figures and in the new appropriations figures. I am giving you simply the order of the savings that we expect to accomplish in the new appropriations.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: You are not prepared at this time to give any figure?","[INTERVIEWED] That is correct.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Some of us are under the impression, sir, that this year of maximum exposure that you now discourage, came about because the Joint Chiefs of Staff thought that in 1954 the Soviets could deliver an atomic attack on the United States. Is there something now that is available to you and the Joint Chiefs of Staff which indicates that will not be a possibility?","[INTERVIEWED] I am not going to quarrel with their estimate on when they will have atomic bombs. But I do not admit that anyone can predict when, if ever, another government would want to launch global war. I just don't believe there is a necessary relationship between those two concepts.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Is it true, sir, that considering the carryover funds and other money available, that there will be about as much money for our allies in the new year as in the present?","[INTERVIEWED] You mean as much money spent in 19547 I have forgotten the exact figure.","Q. About how much?","[INTERVIEWED] As a matter of fact, I must tell you, I definitely determined not to talk in more exact figures than I have already given you today because I was so certain that some of them would become confused. I have dealt with nothing but figures for weeks. I will say this: the expenditure program for 1954, of course, is very largely fixed. As I said, it is in something of a straitjacket, so that the changes that will be made will be gradual. But I will not be more exact on the expenditure program for foreign aid in 1954 than that.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], could you explain in a little more detail how your long-range concept of a long-range program differs from the previous administration's military program, which called for reaching a peak of strength sometime in 1955, and then maintaining that strength over the long pull?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, let me ask you this: if you have a maximum production program, to reach maximum strength by July 1st, 1954--1955--or any other figure, how do you then suddenly level off and maintain it? It is simply not possible. You cannot suddenly reach with all your production lines up and say everything is shut off and becomes zero. You have a job of leveling this thing out, and it means it has to be approached really, literally, many, many months ahead. So it's a change--instead of going to a maximum in the belief you can predict at a certain point--to do this thing in as orderly a fashion, making always the economic factor the secondary, but the important support to your strictly defense factor.","Now, it is really no more susceptible of exact statement than that, but you cannot go full blast with all productive capacity to a single point and then suddenly just level off. You can't do it.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Since presumably not all of the 8.5 reduction in appropriations will be reduction in spending during fiscal 1954, is it now definite that there will not be a balanced budget for fiscal 1954?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I think it would be safe to say that you can't achieve--I don't see how you can achieve complete balance in your expenditure program. I don't believe it could be done.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], last fall, Congressman Mahon, who was then the chairman of the Military Appropriations Subcommittee, said that the House Appropriations Committee would cut the budget by 10 billion. Now, if they cut it below your 8.4 billion, would they seriously hamper the defense program, do you feel?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, if they cut very far, it would require very definite changes in policy, yes.","Actually, these people that I am talking about--the professional people, the civilians, everybody else--have been working very hard to find that money that you can find in a hurried or, you might say, an intensive but quick examination of this thing. There will finally be great or, at least, other savings accomplished.","When you get into the field of logistics, of procurement, storage, issue, evacuation, care of sick and wounded, there are lots of places; but I would say that those cuts cannot be made suddenly and in great amount without causing a great deal of embarrassment.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Can you tell us, on the basis of the outline you have given us, what the possibilities seem to you to be for a tax cut now? Any change in that?","[INTERVIEWED] No, I am not going to speculate on that one just now, Mr. Arrowsmith.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Do your figures, [INTERVIEWED], include an expenditure for the Korean war?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes. They include certain items that have never been included before; for example, budgeting for ammunition.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Does that anticipate a reduction in the cost of the Korean war over last year?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I don't believe I have got the exact comparison of it, Mr. Wilson. I don't believe I have.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: I would like to ask you one final question. Does your new policy indicate that there will be a new kind of a defense establishment? The point I am getting at--","[INTERVIEWED] Not radical, not radical. We do want to concentrate more on the latest weapons, and in this buildup that I am talking about--orderly buildup--constantly getting the latest and best to prevent the factor of obsolescence from overtaking us too quickly. That is one factor for which we take a little bit of credit.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Are those the critical items of which you speak?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes, indeed.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], do these figures in your program mean that there will be a new team on your Joint Chiefs of Staff after their terms expire?","[INTERVIEWED] I am afraid that is something you will have to talk to the Secretary of Defense about. That is his responsibility.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], this question was asked a little while ago, but I did not get the answer clearly. You were asked if you regarded, with this reduction in cash spending, a reduction also in income, whether it is definite that there will not be a balanced budget for 1954 fiscal?","[INTERVIEWED] I said I thought it was safe to predict that complete balance in the expenditure program probably would not be achieved. I don't know; I don't see how the full amount can be met. However, I will tell you this: there is progress made in that direction every day.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], if you open up the Key West agreement, will you open up also the roles and missions assignments made there?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I must tell you, Mrs. Craig, I am not going back into some of those things. I have got other things that occupy my time, and I have got people to go into them. Now finally it will--","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: I thought the message to Congress would mention this.","[INTERVIEWED]--it will be--there are certain philosophies of control, particularly emphasizing civilian control, that are contained in the plan that went to Congress today, and I assume that will be made public in a day or so.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], do you plan to spend some time in Colorado this summer?","[INTERVIEWED] I hope so. [Laughter]","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Could you give us a little run down on when we go? [Laughter]","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I will be perfectly frank with you. I think that whatever Congress does would determine something of my own moves. And I will promise this group this, if it is of any interest to you: as quickly as I get any real information on it, then I will let you know, and let you know what I expect to do; because I realize that you people, after all, go on vacations, too. I would like to go, and I am planning on doing it, if the situation here in Washington will allow me.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: I wanted to ask whether there remains in your request a $1/2 billion item for production equipment to provide mobilization base?","[INTERVIEWED] I don't remember the size of that item. I don't remember the size of it.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Does it remain an identifiable item?","[INTERVIEWED] I don't see how you can take it out completely.","Q.[INTERVIEWER]: Can you say, sir, in what year you do expect a balanced budget? Do your studies go that far?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, I would have to put it relatively. I must say that a great deal of my waking moments are given over to that problem. And we are going to do it. Now, that's all I can say.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], since you expect to shorten lead time on military items, will the defense expenditures be greater over the next several months?","[INTERVIEWED] Well, that is probably true. I haven't asked for the exact schedule of output of money, but that would sound to me like it were true, yes. And it would mean also, of course, a very reduced carryover of money that is appropriated and has not yet been raised at the end of the fiscal year 1954. If you use up some of that carryover now, and then don't ask for as much new money as you have in the past, then you reduce that carryover from an $81 billion figure down to something else.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], do we have an estimate of income for 1954 yet?","[INTERVIEWED] Yes, we do; but as a matter of fact, I am not going to give it today, because this morning the question was raised as to its authenticity.","There is one in the budget now before Congress. You know that; I think it is--68.7 isn't it?--that is close to it. But there is some question raised about it.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], in regard to the Nelson committee study of the Defense departments, their recommendations which I imagine will be released very shortly--","[INTERVIEWED] Nelson?","Q. [INTERVIEWER]. Oh, I beg your pardon. It is my mistake, sir.","THE. PRESIDENT. Go ahead. Now I am on the track.","Q.[INTERVIEWER]: I wanted to ask on what lines their views went toward reorganization of the Defense Department with this idea in mind, that over the years there had been two schools of thought, fundamentally: one that wanted to have a loose federation of the services, each one sovereign in its own right; and the other school of thought that wanted strong central control. I wanted to ask which, could you tell me--to which school of thought do you subscribe to--and the Nelson Rockefeller--","[INTERVIEWED] Well, first of all, I am not certain how the Nelson Rockefeller committee met that problem because, you see, they have been my committee for reorganizing in other departments of Government. And when it came to the Defense Department, because of the size of it, I loaned them to Mr. Wilson, who appointed a committee of his own, and they were incorporated into it. Now, just exactly what that committee felt about the points you raise, I don't know.","I do feel this: that all of us agree that each of these departments should be separately administered, that it is inconsistent, I should say, with good management that we don't have real central direction so far as there are any fields in which duplication or waste can occur. The business of war, and preparing for war, has just got so unconscionably expensive that we cannot waste one single dollar uselessly.","Now, the purpose of putting a strong business organization-which you devoutly hope will stay out of details that are none of its business; but after all, people are human, we understand that-their purpose is to save money through effective management for the United States of America. Now, that's what it is.","And what they have to do: I don't believe that any of us are smart enough--and I put in 40 years in that business, as you know--I don't believe any of us are smart enough to lay out a blueprint for a perfect organization. I believe you have to try something and correct it a little, and try something else and correct it a little. Sometimes you never really get done--we finally go to war, many things affect organization. So I think here, I hope we never get so rigid and solidified that we can't change when we need to.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Day before yesterday the Army announced they were taking the 5th Division out of service.","[INTERVIEWED] It did what?","Q.[INTERVIEWER]: It was taking the 5th Division out of service-deactivating it--a training division. Was that done after consultation with you?","[INTERVIEWED] No, that would not have to come to me, and I haven't heard of it before.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Will the budget reductions you are contemplating bring about a balanced cash budget in fiscal 1954, sir?","[INTERVIEWED] That is the third time that question has been asked, and I will answer it again. I don't think that it possibly can, because the expenditures for 1954 are already fixed by contracts, by commitments that we cannot get out of. It can't be done. That new money has nothing to do, really, with the cash budget for 1954.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: I was speaking of the--of the cash income and cash outgo, not the--","[INTERVIEWED] The income is fixed by tax law, isn't it? Not fixed by this budget that we are asking for at all. It is fixed by tax law. The outgo is fixed by plans that are already in existence, by appropriations that have already been made. Now, largely that is true. You have certain detailed differences.","But there is nothing much you can do about that particular item that you raise.","Q.[INTERVIEWER]: Sir, are you planning a conference Saturday with the Governor of Texas and the Governor of Colorado on the question of oil imports?","[INTERVIEWED] I haven't heard of it. I am having all the Governors here very quickly; but the only thing I heard, I have been challenged to a golf game by one of the Governors. [Laughter]","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: Which one?","[INTERVIEWED] I think it was Texas. I am afraid he's too good.","Q. [INTERVIEWER]: [INTERVIEWED], can you comment on Representative Ayres' of Ohio request to you to hold up a Veterans Administration order legalizing discounts on GI housing loans?","[INTERVIEWED] NO, I haven't heard it.","[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]."]}
